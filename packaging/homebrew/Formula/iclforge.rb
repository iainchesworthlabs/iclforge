# Homebrew formula for forge, iclforge's command-line encoder/decoder.
#
# Builds the CLI only (ICLFORGE_BUILD_CLI=ON, everything else the library
# doesn't need for that off) - same reasoning as the vcpkg port
# (packaging/vcpkg-port/iclforge/) staying library-only, just the other way
# round: Homebrew formulae are for end-user tools, so this ships the tool
# vcpkg deliberately does not, and skips find_package(iclforge) dev files
# vcpkg already covers. The Qt6 GUI (forge-gui) is not packaged here - a Homebrew
# Cask, not a Formula, is the right shape for a bundled .app. That cask
# (../Casks/iclforge.rb) installs the prebuilt forge-gui.app from each release's
# .dmg.
#
# Staged here (packaging/homebrew/Formula/iclforge.rb) for local
# `brew install --build-from-source` validation against this repo, and
# copied into the live personal tap (iainchesworthlabs/homebrew-iclforge) as
# Formula/iclforge.rb after each bump - see docs/releasing.md.
