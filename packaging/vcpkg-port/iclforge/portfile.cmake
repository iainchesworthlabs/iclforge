# vcpkg port for iclforge - installs the library only (iclforge::ac3 and iclforge::containers, plus
# the containers' Matroska, MP4, MPEG-TS and IAMF parts, iclforge::c, the AC-4 library and
# iclforge::iab as opt-in features, off unless asked for, since each adds public API), never the CLI, GUI,
# Hearth, tests, examples or fuzz harnesses - upstream's own ICLFORGE_BUILD_CLI/GUI/HEARTH/TESTS/
# EXAMPLES/FUZZERS options make that a plain OFF each, no patching needed. iclforge::adm (the
# ADM/BW64 reader and its bridge) has no feature here: it needs Boost and, even though it is now
# installed/exported by upstream (shared-only - see cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake's
# ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM block upstream), this port keeps ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=OFF below rather than
# adding an "adm" feature - out of scope for this port until there's a real need for it.

# DERIVED_VERSION_OVERRIDE: upstream derives its version via `git describe`, which finds nothing
# in a tarball checkout and falls back to "0.0.0-dev" - thread the real tag through instead.
#
# ICLFORGE_BUILD_HEARTH defaults ON upstream and builds Hearth, an application (apps/hearth) and a
# library nothing installs (libs/sendspin), with dependencies this port does not declare
# (cpp-httplib, mdns, mbedTLS, libFLAC, Opus); upstream also refuses it beside
# ICLFORGE_BUILD_AC4=OFF, the ac4 feature's absence.
#
# ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM/ICLFORGE_ENABLE_TRACY are already OFF by upstream's own default; pinned
# explicitly so a future default change upstream can't silently pull an undeclared dependency
# into this port. ICLFORGE_WITH_ALSA/ICLFORGE_WITH_PIPEWIRE default to AUTO upstream and would
# otherwise probe the build machine's ambient ALSA/PipeWire installs even though this
# library-only build never builds, links or installs iclforge::audio at all.
