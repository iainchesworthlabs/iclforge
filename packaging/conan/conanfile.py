# Conan (2.x) recipe for iclforge - installs the library only (iclforge::ac3,
# iclforge::matroska/iclforge::mp4/iclforge::mpegts behind their own default-on options, and
# iclforge::c, the AC-4 library, iclforge::iab and iclforge::iamf behind default-off "capi",
# "ac4", "iab" and "iamf" options), never the CLI, GUI, Hearth, tests, examples or fuzz
# harnesses. Same scope as the vcpkg port (packaging/vcpkg-port/iclforge/) - one Conan option
# <-> one ICLFORGE_BUILD_<NAME> CMake option, same pattern that port's vcpkg_check_features()
# call already establishes, and tools/checks/check_packaging_versions.sh holds the two recipes to
# the same components and options. iclforge::adm (the ADM/BW64 reader and its Atmos
# bridge) is deliberately NOT an option here even though upstream now installs/exports
# it (shared-only - see cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake's ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM
# block): iclforge::adm needs Boost, and out-of-scope-for-now applies here the same way it does
# for the vcpkg port's own missing "adm" feature.
#
# This recipe wraps cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake's own install()/export()
# rules rather than reimplementing them: package() just runs `cmake --install`
# and package_info() points consumers at the CMake package config iclforge
# already generates (iclforgeConfig.cmake et al.), instead of asking Conan's
# CMakeDeps generator to synthesise a second, competing one - see
# package_info()'s comment below.
#
# Staged here (packaging/conan/) for local `conan create` validation before
# being submitted to ConanCenter (conan-center-index) as a recipe there -
# see docs/releasing.md.
