// (src/iec61937/src/iec61937.cpp).
//
// This is the one entry point in the project whose input is, by definition,
// something that came off a wire: an S/PDIF or HDMI capture, or a file
// somebody saved from one. Two of its four preamble words are attacker-
// chosen - Pc picks the data type and Pd states a length - and the length is
// exactly the number a naive parser would hand to resize(). Bounding that
// against the data type's repetition period is the property this harness
// exists to keep honest.
//
// Split into two chunks at a mutation-chosen point rather than pushed whole:
// the parser's state machine has to carry a preamble, a header or a payload
// across a chunk boundary, and a fuzzer that only ever fed it one buffer
// would never reach the carry paths at all.
//
// AC-4 (IEC 61937-14) adds a burst whose frame states its own length, which
// the reader checks Pd against, and a packer whose input is a sync frame; the
// input is fed to that packer too.
