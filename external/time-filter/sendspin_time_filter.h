/// @brief Two-dimensional Kalman filter for NTP-style time synchronization between client and
/// server.
///
/// This class implements a time synchronization filter that tracks both the timestamp offset and
/// clock drift rate between a client and server. It processes measurements obtained with NTP-style
/// time messages that contain round-trip timing information to optimally estimate the time
/// relationship while accounting for network latency uncertainty.
///
/// The filter maintains a 2D state vector [offset, drift] with associated covariance matrix to
/// track estimation uncertainty. An adaptive forgetting factor helps the filter recover quickly
/// from network disruptions or server clock adjustments.
///
/// All computations use double precision arithmetic to maintain microsecond-level accuracy over
/// extended periods. Thread-safe access to the current time transformation is provided via
/// std::mutex.
