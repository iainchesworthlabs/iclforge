# outright now and then (a pool 404 for a version the index names, or an index
# caught mid-sync), and apt's own Acquire::Retries treats a 404 as final. The
# workflows' own apt steps run the same loop inline. A function in each script
# rather than one shared file, because the fleet's Packer build uploads and runs
# each of these scripts on its own.
