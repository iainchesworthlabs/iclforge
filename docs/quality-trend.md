# Quality trend

This page has two series. The first, from here to "Where the data lives", is the
[gold-reference
gate](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh)'s
(encode the checked-in golden 5.1 WAV, strict-decode with FFmpeg and with
`forge`'s own decoder, delay-compensated SNR between the two), which covers
AC-3 and E-AC-3, and its measure is Decode accuracy: how closely this decoder agrees with
FFmpeg's. [AC-4 decode quality](#ac-4-decode-quality) is the second, scored
against the source instead.

Each run on `main` that gets through the gold-reference gate, the run after a merge
and the nightly run, has its per-channel numbers appended to history
instead of only living in that run's CI log, under the commit it ran on. A run after a
merge covers every merge since the last one finished when they come faster than it does
([CI for many agents](ci-agentic.md#after-the-merge)), so a commit in the
middle of a burst has no point of its own. It turns the gate's own FFmpeg-oracle SNR check into a
lightweight, trended quality signal — the gate itself runs on every pull request and every
queue entry; what's below is what makes the *numbers*, not just the pass/fail,
outlive the run that produced them.

The gate's own thresholds are fixed floors that always fail CI outright, and
there is now one **per channel** rather than one per fixture — each derived
from that channel's own lowest measurement across every leg and every recorded
commit (`tools/checks/derive_channel_floors.py`). `MIN_SNR_DB` in
`verify_gold_reference.sh` remains the scalar fallback for any check with no
derived vector. [Validation](verification.md#one-floor-per-channel-not-one-per-file)
carries the derivation and the reason: one floor across six channels turned out
to be one gate on the worst channel and 30-70 dB of dead slack on the rest.
On top of that, the append step applies two trailing-baseline checks against
each run's own leg/codec history: a soft one (0.5 dB below the trailing
10-run mean) that only annotates a row below, never fails anything, and a
hard one (10 dB below that mean) that *does* fail the run — after the
numbers are still recorded here, so a big regression is never silently
un-recorded just because it also failed. That failure is the `Publish quality
trend` job in `_build.yml`, surfaced through `ci.yml`'s `build-and-test` call;
it is not one of `_ci-core.yml`'s trend jobs. See `REGRESSION_DROP_DB` and
`HARD_REGRESSION_DROP_DB` in `tools/ci/append_quality_history.py`.

Every point the chart plots is measured against `testdata/audio/reference_51.wav`,
which is **synthesized** — `sin()`, pseudo-random noise and FIR smoothing,
2.5 s long (the table also lists checks on other fixtures, marked below). That is the right choice for this page, which asks "did the
round trip change" and needs the material to be identical across years of
commits for the answer to mean anything. It is the wrong material for
deciding an encoder policy: it carries a flat noise plateau across its whole
top octave that no real programme material has, and tuning the encoder's
bandwidth default against it once produced a measured 2.1 dB "win" that was
purely an artefact of the fixture. Real speech and music fixtures exist for
that question — see [Landscape](landscape.md) and
[tools/generators/README.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/tools/generators/README.md).

## Reading it

Each row is one (commit, CI leg, codec) result — the gate runs on every
`gold_reference` leg (`windows-msvc`, `windows-llvm`, `linux-gcc`,
`linux-gcc-arm64`, `linux-llvm`, `macos-llvm` after a merge, and in the
nightly run also `windows-msvc-arm64`, `linux-llvm-arm64` and
`macos-llvm-x64`; not the ASan+UBSan leg, which stays
diagnostic-only), so a single run contributes up to six rows per check after a
merge and up to nine in the nightly run.

The **Chart** control picks what the lines represent. "Worst of legs, by
branch" (the default) plots the worst of the legs that ran per commit, one line
per branch, against a shared calendar x-axis — a cross-leg floating-point
difference (a ~62 dB vs. ~68 dB split, the arm64 legs below the x86-64 ones,
is a known, expected effect of platform floating-point differences, explained
in [Validation](verification.md#why-arm64-and-x86-64-disagree)) is expected and not itself a
regression, so folding it away is deliberate here: this view answers "did
*anything* regress," not "which platform." "By platform leg" answers that
second question instead — it un-folds a single branch (picked with the
**Branch** control that replaces the branch checkboxes in this view) into
one line per leg, so a leg drifting relative to the others, or trending
down over many commits while the rest hold steady, is visible as a shape in
the chart rather than something you'd only catch by scanning the table leg
by leg. Both views read the same underlying rows; nothing about which view
is active changes what counts as a regression in the table below.

`main`'s recent window is the default view, with the full history used while
it still fits that window. Before 2026-08-25's move to
trunk-based development (see "Where the data lives" below), `develop` was
the everyday integration branch nearly every commit landed on and `main`
only advanced on a release promotion, so the two really were separate
tracks rather than one delayed copy of the other — which is why this page
used to plot them side by side by default. `develop` is retired now and its
line stopped moving on its last commit before the migration; check **Show
historical (develop, pre-2026-08-25)** to add that frozen history back into
the chart and table as a dashed, muted secondary line, styled to read as
archived rather than as a second live series. "By platform leg" offers the
same choice through its **Track** selector.

The **Codec** control scopes the table as well as the chart — picking
`E-AC-3` shows only `eac3` rows, never an unrelated `ac3` row sorted in by
date alone. Within that codec, the table still shows every **Check**:
`verify_gold_reference.sh` can run more than one check per codec (e.g.
`eac3`'s own baseline round-trip alongside `eac3_cplbndstrce0`, a real
third-party FFmpeg bitstream used to regression-test an Annex E decode fix),
and those checks compare fundamentally different things at deliberately
different SNR floors — one is not a worse day for the other. A `†` marks
any check that isn't that codec's primary, continuous series (the one the
chart plots and the dropdown otherwise implies); hover it for why. Never
read two different Check values as one continuous line, even when they
share a Codec and a date range — a `†` row's own trailing baseline (used
for the regression flag below) is computed only against its own check
history, precisely so a steady 25 dB interop floor can't look like a crash
relative to a steady 68 dB round-trip series, or vice versa.

The **worst channel** column names which of the six channels was worst
(`L R C LFE Ls Rs`, the golden reference's WAV channel order), and hovering
it shows every channel's number. In practice it is almost always one of the
two surrounds (`Ls`/`Rs`) — 15-20 dB below the front channels, consistently,
across every leg and commit recorded so far — which tracks with the encoder
allocating fewer bits to the less-dominant surround channels, not a
per-run fluke.

The **tightest margin** column is the one to watch, and it is deliberately a
different question. Every channel is gated against its *own* floor now (see
[Validation](verification.md#one-floor-per-channel-not-one-per-file) for how
those floors are derived), and the channel closest to failing is not the
channel with the lowest number — usually the reverse. The surrounds are lowest
*and* have the lowest floors, so they typically sit further above their gate
than a front channel does above its much higher one. Hovering shows every
channel's margin.

Rows written before per-channel floors show `—` here rather than a number.
They were gated on one floor shared by all six channels, and
back-computing a per-channel margin for them would make the history look like
it carried a gate it did not have. The `worst channel` column is directly
comparable across that boundary; this one is not, by construction.

A regression is now flagged when **any channel** falls 0.5 dB below its own
trailing average, not only when the worst channel does. That closed a real
hole: the worst channel was the same dither-dominated surround on every single
run, so a front channel could fall a long way without the trend check ever
looking at it.

A 🏷 badge marks a row whose commit was tagged as a GitHub release (fetched
client-side from the GitHub API, best-effort — it silently shows nothing if
that call is rate-limited or offline). Release tagging happens after the
fact, on an existing `main` commit, so the badge is a join against the
commit SHA already in quality-history, not a separate data source.

## The fixed-point decode has its own series too

`_fixed`-suffixed checks are the gate run against a decoder built with
`-DICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR=fixed` - Q7.24 integer arithmetic under a block
exponent, the tier for a part with no FPU
([`planning/arithmetic-tiers.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/arithmetic-tiers.md)).
It differs from the double decode at 121 dB and above on the gold streams
(`tools/checks/check_decode_scalar_snr.py`, held to 110 in the same pass), which is as
far below this gate's coding noise as the float32 decode's 139, so the same
reading applies: the series exists to show the arithmetic contributes nothing
this gate can see, and would show a lost bit the day it did. The pass is one of the
`linux-gcc` leg's `scalar_variants` in `.github/ci/legs.jsonc`, which only the nightly run
makes, so the series has a point a night rather than one for each run after a merge.

## The float32 decode has its own series

`_float32`-suffixed checks are the same gate run against a decoder built with
`-DICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR=float` — the arithmetic the minimum-footprint profile
uses, and the arithmetic every fixture on both bare-metal legs is decoded
through. Until that option existed the float32 path could not be built into
anything with a CLI, so nothing here had ever measured it: `docs/building.md`
carried a single hand-taken SNR figure and nothing re-derived it.

Measured against the double build, channel for channel, it comes out **the
same to the resolution this gate reports** — 18.47, 45.63, 51.47, 54.67, 88.21,
35.89, 36.45 dB and so on, identically. That is not the two decodes being
bit-identical; they differ at about 139 dB
(`tools/checks/check_decode_scalar_snr.py`). It is that this gate's SNR is
dominated by *coding* noise 80 dB above that difference, so float32 contributes
nothing measurable to the error budget the quality gate actually measures.

The chart shows one line per codec (`check === codec`), so these sit in the
history data rather than on it — the point of trending them is that a future
change to the float32 path shows up as a divergence from the double series,
which is a comparison no single figure in a document can make. This pass is also one
of the nightly run's `scalar_variants`.

## The direct-form transforms and the float32 encoder have series too

`_reference`-suffixed checks are the gate run with `mode=reference`: the spec's own
direct-form transforms in place of the fast paths
([Validation](verification.md#performance-and-reference-modes)). The `linux-gcc` leg makes
this pass in the run after a merge as well as in the nightly run. `_encfloat`-suffixed
checks are the gate run against an encoder built with `-DICLFORGE_ENCODE_SCALAR=float`, the
arithmetic the ESP32-S3's minimum-footprint profile encodes in. A float encoder makes its
own decisions and produces a different, equally valid stream, so these rows are held to the
same floors as the double encoder's and `tools/checks/check_encode_scalar_quality.py` holds
its worst channel to half a dB of the double encoder's. That pass is a nightly one too.
Neither has a line on the chart.

## Where the data lives

Results are appended to a dedicated `quality-history` branch (`develop.jsonl`
/ `main.jsonl`), not `gh-pages` — `mkdocs gh-deploy` replaces gh-pages'
entire tree on every deploy, which would silently discard anything appended
there outside of what `mkdocs build` itself generates. This page prefers each
history's generated `.recent.jsonl` window and falls back to the full file,
both fetched from `raw.githubusercontent.com`, so a new
push shows up here without waiting on a docs deploy (which,
per [docs.yml](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yml),
only runs on push to `main`).

`develop.jsonl` stopped gaining rows on 2026-08-24, `develop`'s last commit
before the branch was retired in favour of trunk-based development. It is
kept as-is — real project history, not deleted or rewritten — and is what
the "Show historical" control above reads; every trigger that used to append
to it now targets `main` only (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s and
`_build.yml`'s push conditions, and the `--branch` argument
`tools/ci/append_quality_history.py` is called with, both narrowed to `main`
in the same migration).

History is written by the `Publish quality trend` job in `_build.yml`, which
runs once the build legs of a run on `main` have passed, in the run after a
merge and in the nightly run —
never on a pull request or a queue entry, so unmerged work never pollutes the
trend. A leg that a newer run on `main` gave way to leaves a gap in its own
series and does not stop the rest being published; a leg that failed skips the
publish. It reuses numbers the gate already computed rather than re-running the
encode/decode pass, so — unlike a from-scratch perceptual pass, which would
need a nightly cadence to bound cost — publishing after each run costs nothing
extra to compute; only a JSON append and a git push are new.

`main`'s history has a real gap before 2026-08-10: `ci.yml`'s concurrency
group used to key push runs on branch name alone with `cancel-in-progress`
on, so a burst of merges landing within a build's runtime cancelled every
run but the last, silently dropping the gold-reference gate — and this
page's append step with it — before either finished. The specific commits
lost to it were backfilled by hand rather than left blank. Since 2026-09-29
the gap is by design instead: pushes to `main` are verified one at a time and a
burst of merges is one run on the newest commit ([CI for many
agents](ci-agentic.md#after-the-merge)), so a commit in the middle of a burst has no point of
its own, and nothing was dropped.

Two runs can still write here at once, for example the nightly run and a run
after a merge. The run that pushes second is rejected, rebases onto the first,
and meets a conflict: both runs added records to the end of the same file.
[`tools/ci/resolve_history_conflict.py`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/tools/ci/resolve_history_conflict.py)
settles it by keeping both runs' records and writing the `.recent.jsonl`
window again from the result, so what this page reads carries every run's
numbers whichever run finishes first. Anything it cannot account for fails the
publishing job rather than being guessed at, which is what happened to
`main@681a083a` on 2026-09-18 before the script existed.

## AC-4 decode quality

Everything above is AC-3 and E-AC-3. AC-4 has its own series, because its oracle is different:
FFmpeg does not decode AC-4, so
[`tools/checks/score_ac4_decode.py`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/tools/checks/score_ac4_decode.py)
decodes the Dolby Encoding Engine's AC-4 streams and scores each against the source it was encoded
from ([Validation](verification.md#ac-4) describes how). Its measure is Decode accuracy against
that source, not against another decoder. It runs in FFmpeg Validate, a nightly job, on the
`linux-llvm` build, and its pinned floors fail that run. The same run writes the scores as a JSON
artifact, and the `Publish quality trend` job appends one row per stream to
`ac4-quality-main.jsonl` on the same `quality-history` branch, by
[`tools/ci/append_ac4_quality_history.py`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/tools/ci/append_ac4_quality_history.py):
one set of rows per nightly run. It covers 10 of the 15 committed legs, described below the
chart. The AC-4 encoder's own scores (`score_ac4_encode.py`) are held to pinned floors only, and
its race against the Dolby encoder runs locally, so neither has a series; nor do AC-4's objects.

Each row is one DEE stream on one commit: the streams scored channel by channel against their
source, 10 of the 15 committed legs (SIMPLE and A-SPX at 2.0 and 5.1, and immersive stereo). The
A-CPL streams, scored through their downmixes, and the 5.1.4 streams, scored with their routing,
are held to their floors in FFmpeg Validate but have no series. **Minimum SNR** is the
stream's lowest full-band channel SNR against its source; the LFE is left out, since its SNR
against the full-band source is about −2.3 dB on every 5.1 stream and its own floor holds it.
**LSD** is the log-spectral distance and **MOS-LQO** ViSQOL's predicted listening score, all
from the same scoring pass. The chart plots the worst stream for each commit
on the chosen measure. A row is flagged when its SNR falls, or its LSD rises, 0.5 dB past that
stream's own trailing ten-run mean. A hard regression (3 dB of SNR, or 2 dB of LSD) fails the
`Publish quality trend` job after the numbers are pushed, as the AC-3 series does.
