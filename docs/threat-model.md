# Threat model

What this project assumes about the bytes it is handed, what it guarantees when those bytes are
hostile, and what it does not. Written for someone deciding whether to link a decoder (AC-3,
E-AC-3 or AC-4) into a media server, a set-top box or a browser and point it at input from the
internet.

Nothing here is a promise of invulnerability. It is a statement of posture — where the trust
boundary sits, what is checked, what is only structurally bounded, and where the gaps are — so
that an embedder can reason about the remaining risk instead of guessing at it.

The reporting process is in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/SECURITY.md);
[Reporting an issue](#reporting-an-issue) below adds what an embedder specifically should send.

## Trust boundary

**Untrusted.** Everything on this list is treated as adversary-controlled. Each has a parser in
this repository that must not crash, read out of bounds, or loop unboundedly on any input:

| Input | Entry point | Fuzzed |
|---|---|---|
| AC-3 elementary streams | `iclforge::ac3::split_frames`, `iclforge::ac3::FrameDecoder::decode_frame` | yes |
| E-AC-3 elementary streams, including dependent substreams | `iclforge::ac3::split_access_units`, `iclforge::ac3::Eac3Decoder::decode_access_unit` | yes |
| AC-4 elementary streams: sync frames and the table of contents | `iclforge::ac4::scan`, `iclforge::ac4::SyncFrameSplitter`, `iclforge::ac4::parse_raw_frame` | yes — `fuzz_ac4_parse` |

| IAB (SMPTE ST 2098-2) elementary streams and MXF track files | `iclforge::iab::parse_iabitstream`, `iclforge::iab::parse_mxf_iab`, `iclforge::iab::parse_iaframe` | yes — `fuzz_iab_parse` |

| ADM XML + BW64/RF64 (opt-in build) | `iclforge::adm::parse_bw64`, via vendored libadm/libbw64 | **opt-in only** — `fuzz_adm_parse` exists but is built only under `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM`; see [ADM](#adm-xml-and-bw64) |
| Object authenticity tags | `iclforge::ac3::signing::verify_atmos_frame` | yes — `fuzz_signing_verify` (the key is part of the fuzzed input) |
| Matroska/WebM containers | `iclforge::containers::matroska::demux`, `iclforge::containers::matroska::Reader` | yes |
| MP4/ISOBMFF containers | `iclforge::containers::mp4::demux`, `iclforge::containers::mp4::Reader` | yes |
| MPEG-TS containers | `iclforge::containers::mpegts::demux`, `iclforge::containers::mpegts::Reader` | yes |
| OSC control packets (UDP), a live object-position source | `iclforge::objects::oba::parse_osc_packet` | yes — `fuzz_osc_parse`, part of `fuzz/run.sh`'s default target list alongside the other object/metadata-layer harnesses |
| Sendspin's handshake messages from a network peer (Hearth build) | `iclforge::sendspin::handshake` | yes — `fuzz_sendspin_handshake` |
| Sendspin's messages after the handshake, JSON included (Hearth build) | `iclforge::sendspin::json::Document::parse`, the readers in `iclforge::sendspin::messages`, `pairing_messages`, `iclforge` and the other roles' namespaces | yes — `fuzz_sendspin_json`, `fuzz_sendspin_messages` |
| Sendspin's fragments and binary messages: `player@v1`'s audio chunks, `_iclforge_player@v1`'s bursts, and the artwork, visualizer and source messages (Hearth build) | `iclforge::sendspin::Reassembler`, `parse_player_chunk`, `parse_burst_chunk`, `artwork::parse_message`, `visualizer::parse_frame`, `source::parse_chunk` | yes — `fuzz_sendspin_frames` |
| mDNS packets on the local network (Hearth build) | `iclforge::sendspin::discovery::mdns_packets::parse`, over mjansson's `mdns` | **no** — see [Sendspin](#sendspin-hearths-server-and-its-sinks) |
| WebSocket frames (Hearth build) | cpp-httplib, behind `iclforge::sendspin::transport::websocket` | **no** — third-party; see [Sendspin](#sendspin-hearths-server-and-its-sinks) |

**Trusted.** These are the caller's own inputs, and a caller that gets them wrong is a bug in the
caller, not an attack:

- Encoder configuration (`EncoderConfig`, `eac3::FrameConfig`, `AtmosEncoder` settings,
  `iclforge::ac4::EncoderConfig`, the `forge` command line). Illegal combinations are rejected with a
  `FrameError` (AC-4: `EncodeError::kInvalidConfig`, with the rule named by
  `Encoder::refusal_reason()`), but the values are not assumed hostile.
- PCM handed to the encoder. Any float is legal audio; nothing about it can reach a decision the
  bitstream syntax does not already bound.
- The signing key, if an operator supplies one. It is never generated, logged or written to disk
  by this code (`iclforge::base::crypto::SigningKey` zeroizes on destruction).
- File paths, output destinations, and the caller-owned spans the `_into` decode forms write
  through — see [Raw-pointer boundaries](#raw-pointer-boundaries).

**No remaining undefended container.** Matroska/WebM, MP4/ISOBMFF and MPEG-TS all had a reader
land and are in the untrusted table above; each container this project also
writes now has a matching demuxer this project defends. An embedder demuxing a container format
this project does not read — or write, such as a bare Ogg or ADTS wrapper — is still trusting
*its own* demuxer, not this one.

## Memory-safety posture

The codec core is first-party C++23. Its one third-party library is {fmt}, which builds text the
library writes out: version and diagnostic strings, timecodes, and the scene and census JSON. None
of the entry points in the table above is defined in a file that includes it. C++ is not a
memory-safe language, so the posture is a set of specific properties rather than a language
guarantee:

- **Bit reading cannot run off the end.** The AC-3, E-AC-3 and object-layer parsers share
  `iclforge::BitReader`, and the AC-4 inspector and decoder each have a reader of their own with the
  same design. Reading past the end sets a sticky flag (`overflowed()`) and yields zeros rather
  than touching memory; parsers check the flag at a frame or payload boundary instead of guarding
  each read. A truncated or hostile frame therefore decays into a `kTruncated`
  (`DecodeError::kTruncated`; `iclforge::ac4::Error::kTruncated` from the AC-4 inspector) rather than an
  over-read. The IAB reader (`iclforge::iab`) is the exception to the design: its reader returns a
  `std::expected` from every read.
- **Every fallible path returns a value, not an exception.** `std::expected<T, DecodeError>`
  throughout (`iclforge::ac4::DecodeError` for the AC-4 decoder). The codec core does not throw; the only
  exceptions that can escape it are `std::bad_alloc` from an allocation it makes.
- **No owning raw pointers, no manual `new`/`delete`, no C string handling** in the codec core.
  Buffers are `std::vector`; borrowed views are `std::span` and `std::string_view`.
- **Indexed access is `std::span` and `std::vector`, which are bounds-checked only where the
  standard library's own assertions are on** — MSVC's `_STL_VERIFY` in a debug build, and
  libstdc++/libc++ only under `_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS`/`_LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE`, neither of which
  this project sets. The CI builds that are debug builds are the two sanitizer legs, the
  coverage job and the shared-library pass, and all four run in the nightly run, not in the
  pull-request gate or after a merge. The ASan + UBSan leg is also the one that runs the codec
  matrix, so an out-of-range index there fails the job (the TSan leg is debug too, but runs only
  the `concurrency` label — see below). Every other leg, and every shipped package, is a release
  build with no such net — which is why the fuzzers run under ASan rather than relying on the
  library's own checks. (The WAV over-read fixed alongside this document is exactly that story:
  caught by `_STL_VERIFY` in a debug build, invisible in a release one.)

What runs against it:

- **Twenty-four libFuzzer harnesses** under [`fuzz/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/fuzz/README.md),
  built with ASan + UBSan and `-fno-sanitize-recover=all`. Twenty-one are in `fuzz/run.sh`'s
  default list and drive the entry points in the table above for crashes and undefined
  behaviour — format sniffing (`fuzz_scan`), the three container demuxers (`fuzz_matroska_demux`,
  `fuzz_mp4_demux`, `fuzz_mpegts_demux`), the AC-3 and E-AC-3 decoders (`fuzz_ac3_decode`,
  `fuzz_eac3_decode`), AC-4's inspector and decoder (`fuzz_ac4_parse`, `fuzz_ac4_decode`), WAV
  (`fuzz_wav_read`), IEC 61937 burst de-framing (`fuzz_iec61937_unwrap`), the IAB reader
  (`fuzz_iab_parse`), the three object/metadata parsers behind the skip field
  (`fuzz_emdf_parse`, `fuzz_oamd_parse`, `fuzz_joc_parse`), the signature verifier
  (`fuzz_signing_verify`), the OSC parser (`fuzz_osc_parse`) and Sendspin's four
  (`fuzz_sendspin_json`, `fuzz_sendspin_handshake`, `fuzz_sendspin_messages`,
  `fuzz_sendspin_frames`) — and `fuzz_ac4_encode`, which runs the AC-4 encoder over the
  configurations and input it takes and holds it to the decoder. Two more
  (`fuzz_differential_ac3_decode`, `fuzz_differential_eac3_decode`) decode the same mutated
  bytes with FFmpeg as well and diff the PCM, so a *wrong* decode that does not crash is caught
  too. The last, `fuzz_adm_parse`, is built only when `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM` is on — see
  [ADM](#adm-xml-and-bw64). `Fuzz Regress` replays the checked-in seed and regression corpora on
  every push to `main` and on pull requests into it (a repository variable can pause the
  pull-request run, as [Where each check runs](verification.md#where-each-check-runs) says);
  `Fuzz Short` and `Fuzz Differential` add a bounded mutation budget on pushes, and a nightly job
  goes deeper.
- **An ASan + UBSan CI leg** that runs the full test suite and `tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh` —
  every layout, every Annex E tool token, both Atmos container modes, the metadata options —
  so the sanitizers see the real command paths rather than only unit tests. It is a nightly leg.
- **A ThreadSanitizer leg**. The codec core is single-threaded and holds no shared
  state, but the audio layer's lock-free SPSC ring, silence watchdog and drift servo are shared
  between a real-time callback thread and an encoder thread, and neither ASan nor UBSan can see a
  race there — the two runtimes are also mutually exclusive, so it is a separate leg
  (`Linux LLVM TSan`, a `deep`-tier leg in `.github/ci/legs.jsonc`, so it runs in the nightly run;
  preset `linux-llvm-tsan`) rather than more entries on the one above. It runs the `concurrency`
  ctest label only — the audio layer's tests (`tests/audio/`), `forge live`'s
  (`tests/cli/test_cli_live.cpp`) and the Hearth tests that carry the tag —
  because TSan's shadow memory makes everything several times slower and the rest of the suite is
  single-threaded codec maths. `tsan.supp` at the repository root holds the suppressions and is
  near-empty.
- **CodeQL** on the `security-and-quality` suite (less its advisory queries and two that misfire
  here, filtered in `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`; the C++ leg builds the shipped code
  without the tests and the examples), **MSVC PREfast** and **clang-tidy**, all run
  nightly against `main` rather than per pull request; a run that finds something new opens a
  `nightly-analysis` issue, and the alerts themselves are triaged in Security > Code scanning.
  **SonarCloud** runs in the same window for maintainability, duplication and coverage on new
  code, plus bug and vulnerability detection; its BUG and VULNERABILITY findings are also
  triaged in Security > Code scanning (`tools/ci/sonar_to_sarif.py` converts them, since
  SonarCloud has no server-side option to publish there itself), but maintainability findings,
  duplication, coverage and the quality gate status stay in its own dashboard only.
  **OSV scanning**
  (on pull requests, pushes to `main` and a weekly schedule; the pull-request run pauses with the
  same variable) and **OpenSSF Scorecard** (pushes to `main` and a weekly schedule) upload to the
  same tab.

What is *not* covered by that leg: anything threaded that is not tagged `concurrency`. The label
comes from the Catch2 tags themselves (`catch_discover_tests(... ADD_TAGS_AS_LABELS)`), so a race
in code whose tests carry a different tag — or in a path with no test at all — is outside what
TSan sees on any run, and adding a case to the leg means tagging it.

Known history in this class: one real bug of exactly this shape has been found and fixed (commit
`8386c8f` — a decoder that shifted by an unvalidated exponent and reached undefined behaviour on
a malformed differential exponent chain). It was found by a manual adversarial audit; the fuzzers
exist because that audit should not have been the thing that found it.

## Raw-pointer boundaries

Three surfaces cross out of C++ into a caller that the type system cannot help. Each has a
contract the caller must keep; none of them validate it in a release build.

### The C API (`iclforge_c/iclforge.h`)

The safest of the three, by design. Every handle is opaque, every fallible call returns
`iclforge_status_t`, and **nothing is returned through a caller-supplied buffer** — a
variable-length result is an owned handle read through accessors, so no caller has to predict a
size. Every entry point is wrapped in a `noexcept` guard that turns `std::bad_alloc` into
`ICLFORGE_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY` and anything else into `ICLFORGE_ERROR_INTERNAL`, because letting
a C++ exception unwind into a C (or Rust, or Python) frame is undefined behaviour.

What the caller still owns:

- **Lifetime.** Every `_create` needs its `_destroy`. Passing `NULL` to a `_destroy` is a no-op,
  matching `free()`.
- **The `const uint8_t* frame` / `size_t frame_size` pair** every decode entry point takes
  (`iclforge_decoder_decode_frame`, `iclforge_ac4_decoder_decode` and the rest). A size larger
  than the buffer is a caller bug this layer cannot detect; the buffer must be valid for the
  whole call.
- **Accessor indices.** `iclforge_decoded_frame_channel_samples(frame, channel_index)` and
  friends take an index the caller is expected to have read from
  `iclforge_decoded_frame_channel_count` first.
- **No ABI promise before v1.0.** A newer ICL Forge may need a recompile, not merely a relink.

### The `_into` decode forms

`FrameDecoder::decode_frame_into` and `Eac3Decoder::decode_access_unit_into` write PCM into
caller-owned planar spans instead of allocating. The span count and each span's length are
checked by `assert` — which means they are checked in a debug build and **not at all in a
release build**, where an undersized span is a buffer overflow in the caller's memory. The
contract is on both functions' doc comments: one span per channel the frame codes (six covers
every AC-3 layout, sixteen covers §E3.8.2's cap for E-AC-3), each holding `kSamplesPerFrame`
floats. Use the allocating forms if the sizes are not statically obvious.

### The WASM bindings and the JNI bridge

The WASM decoder (`apps/wasm/decoder_bindings.cpp`) copies the JavaScript byte array into a
`std::vector` before parsing, so the decode itself never reads JS-owned memory. What it hands
*back* is a zero-copy `typed_memory_view` into the decoder instance's own buffers: those views
are invalidated by the next `decode()` call or by the instance's destruction, and JavaScript
holding one past that point reads freed WASM heap. The module is built with
`ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH` under a 1 GiB `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` ceiling, which turns heap exhaustion into a
catchable `std::bad_alloc` and a readable refusal instead of a dead tab.

The AC-4 bindings (`apps/wasm/ac4_bindings.cpp`) have the same shape. The decoder copies the
JavaScript byte array before parsing and returns each frame's channels and object samples as
`typed_memory_view`s, valid until that instance's next call. The encoder copies every frame it
returns into a `Uint8Array` of its own, because one call can return several.

The Android JNI bridge (`apps/android/app/src/main/cpp/`) is demo-app scope: it returns strings
through `NewStringUTF` and does not take byte arrays across the boundary, so it has no
`GetByteArrayElements`-style pinned-buffer contract to get wrong. It is not part of the library's
supported surface.

## Resource limits

For AC-3 and E-AC-3 the important structural property is that **every per-access-unit allocation
is bounded by a bitstream field of fixed width**, so no single frame can be made to consume an
unbounded amount of memory or time. Decode cost is linear in the number of access units, with a
bounded cost per unit; there is no super-linear amplification and no recursive descent anywhere
in the parsers. The OSC bundle walker (below) extends that same guarantee to network input rather
than carving out an exception to it: arbitrarily nested bundles are walked with an explicit
stack and a hard depth cap instead of function recursion, by construction rather than by
convention. AC-4's syntax leaves more open, and [its own subsection](#limits-for-ac-4) says
what holds there.

Enforced limits, and where they come from:

| Quantity | Limit | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| AC-3 syncframe | 3,840 bytes | Table 5.18 (`frmsizecod` indexes a fixed table; 38–63 rejected as reserved) |
| E-AC-3 syncframe | 4,096 bytes | `frmsiz` is 11 bits; `(frmsiz + 1) * 2` |
| E-AC-3 syncframe, lower bound | 6 bytes | explicit refusal: a `frmsiz` that does not cover the header it was read from is `kInvalidStream`, not a short span someone reads past |
| Coded channels per substream | 6 (5 full-bandwidth + LFE) | `acmod`/`lfeon` are 3 + 1 bits |
| Rendered channels per access unit | 16 | §E3.8.2 |
| Substream identities held simultaneously | 32 | `strmtyp` (2 bits) × `substreamid` (3 bits); a flat 32-slot array, states lazily allocated |
| Overlap-add state per identity | 12 KiB | 6 channels × 256 doubles |
| Samples per access unit | 1,536 per channel | `kSamplesPerFrame` |
| PCM per access unit | 96 KiB | 16 channels × 1,536 × `sizeof(float)` |
| EMDF skip field | 511 bytes | `skipl` is 9 bits |
| EMDF payload | bounded against the bits actually left before allocating | explicit check in `parse_container` — a `variable_bits` size field could otherwise claim gigabytes from a few dozen bits of garbage |
| `addbsi` | 64 bytes | `addbsil` is 6 bits |
| OAMD objects | 32 | `object_count_bits` is 5 bits; §5.5.2's escape for larger counts (`0x1F` plus a 7-bit extension) is refused rather than implemented |
| JOC objects | 16 | `kMaxObjects`, checked explicitly; TS 103 420 §8.3.2.2's own cap |
| OSC receive buffer | 65,535 bytes | `LivePositionSource`'s `kRecvBufferSize`, sized above the 65,507-byte IPv4 maximum a UDP datagram can ever carry — UDP's own length field is 16 bits, so nothing legal is ever larger |
| OSC bundle nesting | 8 levels | `parse_osc_packet`'s iterative bundle walk (`kMaxBundleDepth`); a bundle nested past the cap is dropped whole rather than descended into |
| Live OSC per-object mailbox | 1 pending update per session object slot | `LivePositionSource`, sized once at construction from the same object-slot budget as "JOC objects" above (at most 15 dynamic objects; TS 103 420 §8.3.2.2 caps the total at 16 once the bed's LFE is counted) |
| WASM demo heap | 1 GiB | `MAXIMUM_MEMORY`, with `std::bad_alloc` caught and reported |

### A hostile `frmsiz`

Worth spelling out because it is the field an attacker reaches for first. `frmsiz` says how long
an E-AC-3 syncframe is, and callers index into the spans the splitter hands back:

- A `frmsiz` **larger than the bytes remaining** is `DecodeError::kTruncated`. The splitter never
  returns a span that overruns the input.
- A `frmsiz` **smaller than the six header bytes already read** is `DecodeError::kInvalidStream` —
  refused outright rather than becoming a short span a later parser reads past.
- A `frmsiz` that is **merely wrong** — self-consistent, but not where the next syncframe
  actually is — desynchronises the split, and the following frame fails its sync-word check.
  Nothing reads outside the input span in the meantime.

The AC-3 equivalent is `frmsizecod`, which indexes a fixed table rather than carrying a length:
values 38–63 are reserved and rejected, and `fscod == 3` is rejected, so the frame size is always
one of 38 tabulated values.

### Limits for AC-4

AC-4 frames are sized by a 16-bit field with a 24-bit escape, and the syntax inside them leaves
counts open that AC-3 and E-AC-3 fix, so the guarantee above is narrower here. What the AC-4
libraries enforce:

| Quantity | Limit | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| AC-4 sync frame | 16,777,215 bytes, plus a 7-byte header and a 2-byte CRC | `frame_size` is 16 bits, or 24 when the 16-bit field reads `0xFFFF` (`iclforge::ac4::scan`) |
| Frames handed back | spans into the input, or into storage the caller supplies | `iclforge::ac4::scan` copies no frame; `iclforge::ac4::SyncFrameSplitter` reports `kBufferTooSmall` rather than growing its storage |
| Objects in an OAMD portion | 64 | `kMaxOamdObjects`; a larger count is refused as unsupported however large the stream says it is |
| Leading ones in an `ext_code` escape | 8 | Table 40 gives the escape 21 bits at most; a ninth leading one refuses the frame |

`variable_bits()` has no limit on the number of groups in the standard, and the decoder sets none:
the loop ends at a clear continuation flag or at the end of the substream, the value is kept
modulo 2^64, and a size built from it is compared with what is left of the substream rather than
looped over. What holds the rest of the property is the harness, not a table: `fuzz_ac4_decode`
is written to fail on any read outside a substream, any loop on a count with no data behind it and
any sanitizer report, and it found the `ext_code` loop above, which the decoder had left
unbounded. There is no measured worst-case expansion ratio for AC-4.

### Open gaps

**No cap on stream length, and no streaming split in the CLI.** `iclforge::ac3::io::scan`,
`iclforge::ac3::split_frames`, `iclforge::ac3::split_access_units` and `iclforge::ac4::scan` take the whole elementary stream as
one `std::span` and return one span per access unit. Peak memory is therefore *O(input size)* —
the bytes themselves plus an index entry per access unit — and there is no limit at which the
library refuses. `forge` inherits this: it reads the encoded input fully into memory (it streams
the *decoded* PCM out, so output is O(1)).

This is deliberate rather than overlooked: what counts as "too large" is the embedder's policy,
not the library's, and a hard cap in the library would break legitimate long-file use. The
mitigation is on the caller:

- Bound the input before calling. A length limit, a container-level packet budget, or a memory
  cgroup are all more appropriate than a constant compiled into a codec.
- Or drive the per-frame API directly. `FrameDecoder::decode_frame` and
  `Eac3Decoder::decode_substream`/`decode_access_unit` each take one unit at a time, and the
  `_into` forms write into caller-owned storage, so a caller that delimits units itself never
  needs the whole stream resident. `iclforge::ac3::io::AccessUnitAccumulator` (AC-3, E-AC-3) and
  `iclforge::ac4::SyncFrameSplitter` (AC-4) do the delimiting incrementally in storage the caller owns;
  the ESP32 player uses the first, and neither is used by `forge`.

**No decode time bound.** Nothing in the library measures or limits wall-clock time. Because
per-unit cost is bounded and the parsers do not recurse or backtrack, total decode time is linear
in input length — there is no input that makes a *single* frame slow. Watchdog the call if the
threat is a peer feeding an endless stream; there is nothing to configure here.

**Worst-case expansion ratio.** A minimum-size access unit is 6 bytes and a maximum-size one
produces 96 KiB of PCM, so the structural upper bound on decoded-bytes-per-input-byte is roughly
16,000:1. That is an upper bound from field widths, not a measured achievable figure — a frame
short enough to hit it does not carry enough bits to code channels at all, and overflows the bit
reader into `kTruncated` first. Bound decoded *output*, not input bytes, if this matters.

**A WAV file is read whole.** `iclforge::ac3::io::read_wav` reads its entire source into memory before
parsing, so memory is O(file). `iclforge::ac3::io::WavStreamReader` is the block-at-a-time alternative and
reads only a fixed header window (a `data` chunk beyond that window is refused rather than
searched for). A WAV may declare up to 65,535 channels; the per-channel vector overhead that
implies (~1.5 MB) is not proportional to the file that declared it, though the sample data itself
is still clamped to the bytes actually present.

### ADM XML and BW64

`atmos-adm` and `iclforge::adm::` are **off by default** (`-DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`) and, unlike every
other parser here, are not this project's own code: the XML and BW64/RF64 reading is vendored
libadm and libbw64, plus Boost headers. That means:

- **The fuzz harness that covers this path is opt-in, not continuous.** `fuzz_adm_parse` drives
  `iclforge::adm::parse_bw64` over BW64 chunks plus an arbitrary XML document, but it is built only when
  `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM` is on (`fuzz/run.sh` turns that on via `ICLFORGE_FUZZ_ADM=1`), and the one
  CI job that runs it — `Fuzz ADM Nightly` — is schedule/dispatch-only and `continue-on-error`,
  because a vcpkg restore plus the libbw64/libadm `FetchContent` pulls cost more than the mutation
  budget and most of what the harness reaches is third-party code. It is not one of the
  twenty-one harnesses in `fuzz/run.sh`'s default list, which run on every push. The resource
  limits above do not apply here either way: there
  is no document-size cap, no entity-expansion limit and no element-count limit; an enormous or
  deeply nested ADM document is bounded by nothing this project controls.
- **libbw64 is fetched from a maintained fork, not the EBU's own repository.** The EBU's
  `github.com/ebu/libbw64` last tagged a release in January 2019 (`0.10.0`); its own `master`
  branch is 77 commits ahead of that tag, and its changelog describes those commits as fixing "a
  number of buffer overruns, integer overflows, and uses of uninitialised data which may be
  triggered by reading malformed files", but has tagged no release containing them. This module
  pinned `0.10.0` at first and patched around the gap
  (`src/adm/patch_libbw64.cmake`, `adm.cpp`'s own pre-check) as `fuzz_adm_parse` and an audit
  of libbw64 for the same pattern found an unbounded allocation, an unbounded loop, a read of
  uninitialised stack and a `<ds64>` table that could resize a chunk other than `<data>` to
  whatever it liked. `github.com/pwnified/libbw64`, an active single-maintainer fork, carries the
  EBU's own unreleased hardening forward and closes all of that — confirmed by replaying every
  crafted input from that investigation clean, not just by reading its source — plus real
  hardening of its own; `docs/library/adm.md`'s "Built on the EBU's own reference implementations"
  section has the reasoning for depending on a fork rather than the EBU directly, and
  `fuzz/README.md`'s ADM section has the measurements. The fork's own commit is pinned (not a
  branch), the same way the tag used to be. Two small patches remain against it, for behaviours
  this module's tests need that the fork does not have by default: a truncated recording still
  parsing, and 64-bit float actually reaching the decode the fork's own utilities already
  support (its `<fmt >` parsing refuses any 64-bit width outright, PCM or float, before that
  decode is ever called) — see `patch_libbw64.cmake`'s own comment, which also links the PRs
  proposing the same fixes upstream.
- The whole `axml` chunk is materialised as a string and re-parsed from an `istringstream`, so
  memory is O(document).
- Parse and graph-resolution failures do surface as real diagnostics (`iclforge::adm::AdmError`,
  `iclforge::adm::BridgeError`, each with its own `describe()`) rather than a crash or a bare
  non-zero exit.

**Do not enable the ADM build for untrusted input.** It exists to ingest professional master
files an operator already trusts. Extending the threat model to cover it means putting the
vendored parsers under the same every-push fuzzing the rest of the table gets, not a nightly
advisory job, and deciding a document-size policy; neither has been done.

### Object signing is authentication, not integrity of the stream

`iclforge::ac3::signing::verify_atmos_frame`/`verify_atmos_stream` check an HMAC tag over the EMDF object
container. This tells you the object metadata came from someone holding the key. It does **not**
authenticate the audio, the bed, or anything outside the container, and a stream with no
container at all has nothing to verify — see
[Object signing](concepts/object-signing.md). Verification is opt-in
(`forge decode ... verify-objects`); a signed-but-unchecked stream decodes exactly like an
unsigned one. This project ships no key.

### OSC live-position input has no authentication or encryption

`positions=osc:<port>` (`forge live mode=atmos`) and the GUI live room's "Drive objects from
OSC" toggle open a plain UDP socket. OSC 1.0 has no authentication or encryption of its own, and
this project adds neither: anyone who can reach the bound address and port can send
`/object/<n>/xyz` and move that object, full stop. The source IP is not checked — UDP has no
connection to check it against, and it is trivially spoofable regardless — so "only my
show-control rig sent that" is never a guarantee this layer gives an operator.

The default bind is loopback (`127.0.0.1`): a session accepts datagrams only from the machine
running it unless the operator explicitly widens that — `positions=osc:any:<port>` on the CLI,
or the GUI's "any interface" checkbox, both of which bind `0.0.0.0` instead. This is opt-in
surface on top of opt-in surface: a session listens for OSC at all only when `positions=` (or
the GUI toggle) is explicitly used, and listens on every interface only when that is explicitly
widened too.

What a successful spoof or injection buys an attacker is narrow. `iclforge::objects::oba::apply`
(`src/objects/src/scene_osc.cpp`) merges only position, gain and `lfe_send` onto an object's
existing placement, or releases it back to its authored automation (`/object/<n>/release`) —
there is no path from this input to encoder configuration, to the filesystem, or to anything
outside the object placements themselves. The blast radius of a successful attack is "objects
move to wherever the packet says," never a compromised process.

### Sendspin: Hearth's server and its sinks

`src/sendspin`, built only with `ICLFORGE_BUILD_HEARTH`, listens on the local network. A sink
(`hearth-testsink` on a computer, or `hearth_sink` on an ESP32-S3, ESP32-C6 or ESP32-P4 board)
accepts WebSocket connections on port 8928 and advertises `_sendspin._tcp`; Hearth's server
listens on 8927, advertises `_sendspin-server._tcp`, and dials the players it finds. Anyone on the
network can open a connection to either, and anyone can send them mDNS packets. The protocol, and
where Hearth departs from it, is in
[`planning/hearth-sendspin-extension.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/hearth-sendspin-extension.md).

**A peer without a key reaches the handshake and little more.** After the handshake's text
frames, every message is sealed with Noise `KKpsk2` under a PSK both ends hold: a pairing
record's long-term PSK, a device's pairing PSK, or the Sentinel, whose value is public. Under the
Sentinel a connection can pair; it can play only on a player that offers unpaired access (off by
default on the test sink), and Hearth's server starts playback there only for a client its
operator has approved. What such a peer can still do:

- **Guess a pairing code, a bounded number of times.** Code pairing runs CPace over the
  handshake's hash, so a wrong guess gives nothing to test further codes against offline. A
  dynamic code allows at most 20 rounds before the device's operator resets the limit. A static
  code is accepted only in a five-minute window a gesture on the device opens, for at most five
  failures, and only on the connection that carried the window's first attempt.
- **Show the server's operator a sentence.** A player's `client/pair-pending` message reaches the
  operator as text from an unauthenticated device, cut to 800 bytes.
- **Use connections, memory and time.** The server's listener takes 32 connections and the test
  sink's 4; a handshake, or a wait for the first activation, that stalls is closed after 30
  seconds; a message is refused at 4 MiB before anything is allocated for it; and a peer that
  stops reading is disconnected once 8 MiB wait to be sent to it. There is no limit on
  connection attempts from one address beyond these.

**A key is the credential.** A device's pairing PSK token (`SP:0...`) pairs whoever enters it
into a server; the test sink prints its own at start. A paired server can play audio and send
the commands a player lists: volume, mute and output delay, and over `_iclforge_player@v1` the
settings a sink admits. What a sink decodes is an elementary stream from that server, and meets
the decoder's posture above. The test sink keeps its identity key, pairing PSK and pairing
records as files in its state directory, readable and writable by their owner only where the
file system supports it.

**mDNS is unauthenticated.** A host on the network can advertise a service pointing at any
address and port, and Hearth's server dials it every ten seconds while it is advertised. The
handshake fails unless that address holds a key the server accepts, but the connection attempt
goes out. A browser remembers at most 64 instances and hosts, and reads packets of at most 9,000
bytes.

**Not fuzzed.** The mDNS packet reader and cpp-httplib's WebSocket framing sit outside
`fuzz/run.sh`'s build, which keeps the Sendspin library's core free of vcpkg dependencies. The
packet reader has unit tests over packets that end early and names that point at themselves; the
WebSocket framing is cpp-httplib's own code.

**A board's page and REST API have no authentication.** `hearth_sink` serves its page and routes
on port 80 beside the player, and whoever can reach that port can do what they allow without a
key:

- play any HTTP URL, stop a play, and set the volume;
- change the board's name, layout, slot width and wiring, and the network it joins at its next
  restart (`PUT /network`, whose body carries the passphrase in clear over HTTP);
- forget every pairing, which gives the board a new identity, or one server's pairing, and lift
  the limit on wrong pairing codes;
- read which servers the board is paired with (`GET /pairing`): each one's name, as its own hello
  gave it, and its server_id, which is its public key;
- read the network the board is on (its SSID, signal and address) and its firmware's version;
- read `GET /status`, including the pairing code while a pairing runs. So on a board, pairing by
  code shows only that the server's operator can reach the page, and anyone who can reach it can
  pair a server of their own. The network is the boundary for pairing, as it is for the rest. The
  pairing token pairs with no code at all, and only the console prints it.

A page on another site, opened by someone on the same network, can send the board requests that
need no CORS preflight, such as `POST /play` with a text body. Forgetting one server that way
needs its whole server_id, which such a page cannot read from `GET /pairing`.
[`planning/esp32-device-ui.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/esp32-device-ui.md)
records that exposure and the decision to leave it. The page puts every string from `/status` into
the document as text, never as markup.

**A board keeps its keys in NVS, unencrypted.** Its X25519 identity, its pairing PSK, up to eight
pairing records with their servers' names, and the Wi-Fi passphrase are in the NVS partition,
and these builds turn on neither NVS encryption nor flash encryption. Whoever holds the board can
read them with `esptool`, and with them pass as the board to every server it paired with, or
join its network. Turning on both is the integrator's choice, and no build here has tried it.

**The console is trusted.** Anyone with the board's USB port can read its pairing token, give it a
network over Improv Wi-Fi, and type `pair forget` or `pair reset`.

**A board's limits are its own.** The player holds three connections at once. It closes a
connection that sends a message larger than its largest chunk
(`CONFIG_ICLFORGE_EXAMPLE_SENDSPIN_MAX_CHUNK_BYTES`, 25,600 bytes by default) before storing it.
A chunk that does not fit the ring between the network and the decoder is dropped and counted.
A chunk of the wrong type, or a unit that fails to decode, is counted as invalid, and the decoder
starts again at the next burst. The decoder meets the posture above.

## What a decode failure looks like

Every decode entry point returns `std::expected<..., DecodeError>`. The AC-3 and E-AC-3
decoders' error is one of seven values: `kTruncated`, `kBadSyncWord`, `kBadCrc`, `kReservedValue`,
`kUnsupported` (a bsid this decoder does not read), `kInvalidStream` or `kNoReferenceTransform` (a
build without the direct-form transform, asked for it). `iclforge::ac3::describe()` turns each into a
sentence. The AC-4 decoder's `iclforge::ac4::DecodeError` has five: `kTruncated`, `kInvalidToc` (the table
of contents did not parse), `kInvalidStream`, `kUnsupported` (legal AC-4 this decoder does not
read; `Decoder::refusal_reason()` names it) and `kMissingIFrame` (a frame that needs configuration
no I-frame has sent yet), and the inspector's `iclforge::ac4::Error` has three (`kTruncated`, `kLostSync`,
`kUnsupportedBitstreamVersion`).

By default a frame that fails produces no audio and the caller decides what to do. All three
decoders take a concealment policy (`DecoderConfig::concealment`; `conceal=repeat|mute|off` on
`forge decode` and `monitor`, off by default) that returns a frame's worth of audio instead of
the error, repeating the last good block with a fade or playing silence, so a stream with a
damaged frame stays continuous. A frame that fails before any frame has decoded has nothing to
conceal from and still returns its error.

A refusal is not a rollback, though. The decoder's own state — overlap-add delay, the §7.3.4
dither generator, JOC reconstruction — advances block by block as the frame is parsed, and a
frame refused part-way through has already advanced it as far as it got. On an `_into` form the
caller's spans are left in an unspecified state for the same reason. Neither is a memory-safety
problem (nothing is read or written outside its own buffer), but a caller that needs a clean
state after an error should construct a fresh decoder rather than continue with the one that
refused.

CRC is checked, on both generations: AC-3 checks `crc1` over the first 5/8 of the frame and
`crc2` over the whole of it, E-AC-3 checks its single CRC over everything past the sync word.
`kBadCrc` is a real refusal, not a warning.

AC-4 differs. A sync frame with the sync word `0xAC41` carries a CRC-16 (Annex G), and
`iclforge::ac4::scan` and `iclforge::ac4::SyncFrameSplitter` compute it and report the result per frame
(`SyncFrame::crc_ok`; `forge probe` counts the failures), but neither they nor `iclforge::ac4::Decoder`
refuse a frame for a bad CRC. A frame with one still reaches the decoder's syntax layer, which is
why `fuzz_ac4_decode` needs no CRC-repairing mutator. A caller that wants AC-3's behaviour checks
`crc_ok` itself.

## Reporting an issue

Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/security/advisories/new),
privately — the process and timelines are in
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

If you found it while embedding this library, the two things that speed up a fix most are:

1. **The input.** A stream, WAV or ADM file that reproduces it, however small. If it came out of
   a fuzzer, the raw corpus file is ideal — it drops straight into
   `fuzz/regressions/<harness>/` as a permanent regression case.
2. **Which entry point you called**, and whether you were using an allocating decode form or an
   `_into` form with your own spans. Those have different contracts and a report that does not
   say which one is in play can take a while to place.

A sanitizer report (ASan/UBSan stack) is worth more than a description of the symptom, and the
build that produced it (`forge --version` prints version, commit and toolchain) says whether
what you hit is already fixed.
