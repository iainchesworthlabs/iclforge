# Conformance vectors

Every other check in this project consumes someone else's streams as an oracle — FFmpeg's
decoder, Dolby's Reference Player, Dolby's Media Encoder. This is the one that goes the other
way: a versioned set of streams *this* encoder produces, published so another implementation has
something concrete to test against.

It exists because nothing else free does. ATSC A/52 and ETSI TS 102 366 are both published
documents, but neither body distributes conformance bitstreams publicly, and Dolby's own test
material is licensed. Someone writing an AC-3 or E-AC-3 decoder from the standard has the text
and nothing to check their reading of it against. The set covers AC-3 and E-AC-3 only; it has no
AC-4 vector (see [What it does not prove](#what-it-does-not-prove)).

## Getting it

Attached to every [GitHub release](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/releases) as
`iclforge-conformance-vectors-<version>.tar.gz`, alongside the packages, the SPDX SBOM, the
`SHA512SUMS` and the Sigstore provenance attestations — it is signed, checksummed and attested
exactly like every other release asset (see [Releasing](releasing.md#what-gets-published)).

## What is in it

60 streams: AC-3 in every coding mode, E-AC-3 at every layout and with each Annex E tool and the
combinations that matter, both VBR shapes, every sample rate including the `fscod2` half rates,
and Dolby Atmos with objects. Each one comes with the PCM it was encoded from, its hashes, and a
sentence naming the syntax it is there for.

```
MANIFEST.json    every vector: what it exercises, its hashes, FFmpeg's ability to read it

vectors/atmos/   E-AC-3 carrying Atmos objects (OAMD + JOC, ETSI TS 103 420)
paths.txt        the authored object-motion keyframes one Atmos vector was built from
```

Coverage is a cross of two axes rather than their full product: every layout and every coding
tool at 48 kHz, and every sample rate at a representative pair of layouts. The full product would
be enormous and mostly redundant. The manifest says so in as many words, so a missing
7.1.4-at-16-kHz vector does not read as a coverage claim.

## Using it to test a decoder

**Decode each vector and measure against its `source`.** That is the check that means something
across implementations. `MANIFEST.json` names the source WAV for every vector that has one (the
synthesis commands — `silence`, `atmos` — have none).

**Do not compare decoded PCM byte-for-byte against `decoded_pcm_sha256`.** That hash is this
project's own decoder's output, on the exact toolchain the manifest's `built_with` names. Two
correct decoders disagree in the last bits of every float sample. The hash is there so a
regenerated bundle can be checked against a published one, not so a third-party decoder can be.

**Do compare `decoded_levels`.** Per-channel peak and RMS in dBFS survive any correct decoder's
own rounding, so a channel more than a fraction of a dB out — or in the wrong slot — is a real
finding. Channel names are A/52 Table 5.8 order for AC-3 and Table E2.5 location order for
E-AC-3.

**Read `exercises` before chasing a failure.** It names what each vector is for, down to the
clause: which Annex E tools are on, whether the stream carries dependent substreams, whether it
is a reduced-rate (`fscod2`) stream, whether object metadata rides in an EMDF container.

**Check `ffmpeg` before reaching for a second opinion.** Three states, not two:

| `support` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `full` | FFmpeg decodes the audio — it is available to you as an independent oracle |
| `header_only` | FFmpeg walks the framing correctly but refuses the audio |
| `none` | FFmpeg cannot read the stream at all |

The mapping comes straight from [Validation → Where the oracles don't
reach](verification.md#where-the-oracles-dont-reach): a second dependent substream (7.1.4) is
rejected by `ff_ac3_parse_header`; enhanced coupling and transient pre-noise processing have no
syntax in FFmpeg's Annex E parser at all; `fscod2` framing is read but the audio is refused (by
FFmpeg *and* by Dolby's own Reference Player). Those four are exactly where an independent
implementation is most useful, because nothing else public reads them either — and exactly where
this vector set is checked only against this project's own decoder, which is a weaker claim and
is stated as one.

## What it does not prove

- **The source material is synthetic** — sine tones plus seeded, band-limited noise. That is what
  makes the set redistributable, and it exercises every coding tool, but it is not real programme
  material: a defect that only shows on speech or music is not something these vectors can find.
  Redistributable CC0 speech and music now exist in the tree, added as
  `testdata/audio/programme_speech_stereo.flac` and `programme_music_stereo.flac` — but this
  set was never wired to them: `tools/generators/gen_conformance_vectors.py` still synthesizes
  every source from first principles, and its own comment marks the spot where those files would
  join. Pointing the generator at them is outstanding work.
- **Agreement with these vectors is agreement with one implementation**, not with the standard.
  Where FFmpeg can read a vector, the manifest says so, and cross-checking against it is
  meaningfully stronger than checking against this project alone.
- **The Atmos vectors are unsigned** unless the operator regenerating them supplies a key. A
  licensed decoder gates object decoding on an authenticity tag keyed to a secret this project
  does not have — see [Object signing](concepts/object-signing.md). The unsigned vectors are
  fully decodable by any implementation that does not enforce that gate.
- **There is no AC-4 vector.** `tools/generators/gen_conformance_vectors.py` writes AC-3 and
  E-AC-3 only. ETSI publishes no AC-4 conformance bitstreams and no reference decode, so an AC-4
  implementer has the same gap an AC-3 one had. The AC-4 decoder and encoder are checked against
  streams from Dolby Encoding Engine and from the encoder itself; the ones committed under
  `testdata/` are test inputs and are not attached to a release. [Validation](verification.md#ac-4)
  lists the checks.

## Hashes are per-toolchain

Compare a regenerated bundle's hashes only against a bundle built the same way.

- Regenerating with the toolchain the manifest's `built_with` names reproduces every hash in it
  exactly. That is asserted, not assumed — `--check-determinism` generates the whole bundle a
  second time and fails if a single hash moves.
- The decoded-PCM hashes do not carry from x86-64 to arm64. This project's arm64 decoder differs
  from its x86-64 decoder in the last bit of the channels that agree most closely with FFmpeg,
  which shows as a 6.02 dB step on the gold-reference gate ([Building](building.md) records the
  measurements, and [Validation](verification.md#why-arm64-and-x86-64-disagree) the analysis).
- The encoded bytes are pinned across toolchains for three streams and no more.
  `tools/checks/check_cross_platform_hash.py` holds one SHA-256 for each of the gold-reference
  AC-3, E-AC-3 and E-AC-3 coupling encodes in `testdata/bitstream-hashes.json`, and every
  kernel line those pins name (x86-64 SSE2, arm64 NEON, generic) produces the same bytes for
  them. Nothing pins the bundle's own encodes across compilers and architectures, so a different
  compiler or architecture may change the hash of one.

A separate investigation asked why the arm64 offset (6.02 dB, exactly one exponent) is there, and
has closed without an answer: both hypotheses it proposed — Homebrew's libm, then FMA contraction —
were falsified by direct measurement. The identical encoded bytes above put it in the decoder on
arm64, which no emulated run has reproduced. The roadmap's Encoder reproducibility row lists what
is left on the encoder side (re-validating the floating-point-gated bit-cost thresholds); until
the bundle's other encodes are pinned too, it records exactly what built it.

## Regenerating it

```bash
cmake --preset config-linux-gcc && cmake --build --preset build-linux-gcc
python tools/generators/gen_conformance_vectors.py \
    --cli build/config-linux-gcc/bin/forge \
    --out dist/conformance-vectors \
    --check-determinism --archive
```

`--archive` writes the `.tar.gz` with every timestamp, owner and mode pinned, so two identical
bundles produce two identical archives. `--check-determinism` generates a second bundle into a
temporary directory and diffs the manifests. The release workflow runs both.

Adding a vector means adding one `Vector(...)` to `build_vector_list()` in that script, with the
`exercises` sentence that says why it is there. The FFmpeg-support column is derived, not typed:
`_ffmpeg_support()` applies the rules above from the vector's own layout, tools and sample rate,
so it cannot drift out of step with what the oracle table says.

The *list* is hand-maintained, though. `tools/checks/check_matrix_coverage.py` asks whether
`tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh` names every CLI token the binary knows about; nothing asks that of
this set, so a new layout or tool token can land without gaining a vector. What CI does catch is
the other direction — the generator drives real `forge` command lines in the Linux GCC leg of
every run on `main`, after a merge and nightly, so a token that changes spelling turns that run
red rather than the release. The pull-request gate does not run it.

To include the signed Atmos vector, supply a key — the same environment `forge` itself reads:

```bash
ICLFORGE_SIGNING_KEY_FILE=/path/to/key python tools/generators/gen_conformance_vectors.py \
    --cli build/config-linux-gcc/bin/forge --out dist/conformance-vectors --sign
```

Without a key `--sign` is refused outright rather than silently producing an unsigned stream
under a signed name. No key ships with this project and none is invented by the generator.

## Licensing

Every stream in the set is this project's own encoder output, encoded from source PCM this
project generated — the checked-in gate fixtures at 48 kHz, and synthesis by the generator itself
at the other rates. Nothing from `testdata/external-baseline/` (Dolby Media Encoder and
FFmpeg output, kept for comparison only) is ever included. The bundle carries the project's own
licence.
