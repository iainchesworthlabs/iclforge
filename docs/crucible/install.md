# Install and first run

Crucible suppresses each application's original output while it plays the combined mix. Windows
uses a silent virtual audio device; Linux creates a temporary PipeWire node; macOS process taps
mute captured applications.

## Windows

### Get it

`iclforge-crucible-<version>-win64.zip`, from the releases page. No release has carried it yet:
`v0.10.0-beta.1` is older than the Crucible packages, so the first release made after the rename is
the first that can, and until then a checkout builds the same file (`cpack -D
CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL=crucible` in the build directory). It carries the window, the
console runner, its own Qt runtime, the driver's install and remove scripts, the third-party
notices (`NOTICES.txt`) and the licence (`LICENSE.txt`). It does not carry the driver those
scripts install — the next section says why, and what that means before you change any security
setting. Unpack it somewhere and run `crucible.exe`. About > Licences… shows the same notices
from inside the window.

It is a separate download from the main `iclforge` package, and stays one while its driver is
test-signed.

### The silent device

Crucible needs a virtual output device that discards what it is given. On Windows that is a
kernel driver, and **the download does not carry it**. The zip has the driver's install and
remove scripts, because the Settings page runs them; the driver they install is not in it. That
driver is **test-signed**, so it would not load on a normal machine, and shipping it waits on an
EV certificate and an attestation submission.

So on a packaged copy there is nothing to install. **Install driver** is greyed, and the note
beside it says there is no built driver package in the driver folder. Turning test signing on
will not change that, so leave both security settings where they are unless you have built the
driver yourself.

Building it takes a checkout and the WDK: `apps/crucible/windows/driver` holds the sources, the solution
and the install and remove scripts, and the build writes its package underneath. Crucible run
from that same checkout already looks there; a packaged copy has to be pointed at it under
Settings → Advanced → Driver folder. With a package in that folder, **Install driver** un-greys
and runs the package's install script elevated. A test-signed driver then loads only on a machine
that has test signing on and memory integrity off, which is what the Settings page asks for once
a package is in the folder and the device still is not there:

```
bcdedit /set testsigning on
```
then restart. Memory integrity is under Windows Security → Device security → Core isolation.

Both are machine-wide security settings, appropriate for a development machine but not a machine
you depend on. Once the driver is attestation-signed, it travels in the package, installs with
the application, and needs neither setting.

With the driver installed, "Speakers (Crucible Silent Output)" appears in your sound settings.
Crucible's Settings page then shows the silent device as present.

### Without the driver

This is where a packaged copy starts, and where it stays until the driver is signed. Crucible
still runs: taps, placements and every output mode work, and you will hear the direct mix as
well, because applications are still playing to a device you can hear. Two ways around it short
of building and installing the driver:

- make some endpoint you cannot hear the default — a monitor with no speakers, an idle virtual
  cable, a muted device — and point Crucible's silent-device filter at it under Settings →
  Advanced;
- or accept the doubling while you try it out.

The window says which of these you are in rather than leaving you to work it out.

## Linux

### Requirements

- **PipeWire.** Crucible cannot use the ALSA backend — it exists to tap each application
  separately, and ALSA has no per-application concept at all. A build configured against ALSA is
  refused at configure time with a message saying so.
- `libpipewire-0.3-dev` to build, `pipewire` and a session manager (WirePlumber) to run.
- `libxcb1-dev` for the full-screen rule on X11 (optional; without it the rule is off and the
  Room page says why).
- `qt6-svg-dev` to build and `libqt6svg6` to run, for application icons that exist only as
  SVG in the icon theme (`org.gnome.*` applications, most Flatpaks). Qt SVG is optional: without
  it the configure log says so and those applications show the monogram.

### Get it

`iclforge-crucible-<version>-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, or the `iclforge-crucible_<version>_amd64.deb`
beside it, from the releases page; on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, or any other 64-bit ARM Debian or
Ubuntu machine, the `-Linux-aarch64.tar.gz` and the `_arm64.deb` beside those. No release has
carried them yet (the first release made after the rename is the first that can; [Build
it](#build-it) makes the same files). All four come off
the same Crucible pass on the two Linux LLVM legs — the CI legs that build against PipeWire,
which is the only backend Crucible accepts, one per architecture — and are collected into the
release with every other package ([docs/releasing.md](../releasing.md#what-gets-published) says
how). None of them carries Qt; the system's own loader finds it.

Nothing in the release gates on those files being there. The x86_64 leg skips the window and its
package with a warning if the Qt it finds is older than the 6.8 the window needs, and the release
publishes without them; the leg's log says when that happened. The arm64 leg does not skip: a
step beside the pass fails that leg when the window is missing, and reads the architecture off
the binary and the `.deb` rather than trusting their filenames.

### Build it

A checkout produces the same files — `cpack -D CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL=crucible` in the build
directory — and is the route for anything you have changed, and for a distribution whose Qt or
PipeWire is older than the one the packages were built against. From a checkout:

```bash
cmake --preset config-linux-gcc -B build/crucible -DICLFORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE=ON -DICLFORGE_WITH_ALSA=OFF -DICLFORGE_WITH_PIPEWIRE=ON
```

```bash
cmake --build build/crucible --target crucible crucible-run
```

`-DICLFORGE_WITH_ALSA=OFF` is not optional. With ALSA headers present the library selects ALSA,
and Crucible refuses to build against it.

The tarball and the `.deb` carry the notices under `share/doc/iclforge-crucible/`:
`NOTICES.txt` (what the build links and embeds, with each licence), `LICENSE.txt`, and the
notices once more as `copyright`, the name Debian tools look for. About > Licences… shows the
same text.

### The silent device

Nothing to install. Crucible creates a PipeWire node called **"Crucible (silent)"** while it
runs, and it disappears when Crucible exits. No driver, no signing, no password, nothing left on
your machine. The Settings page's silent-device block says as much on Linux — its button reads
**Create device** rather than Install driver, and there is no driver folder under Advanced,
because there is nothing to point at.

Send applications — from the first-run dialog, the Room rail or the Signal path page — creates
the node if it is not there yet, in the same press; Settings' Create device makes it ahead of
time. Crucible sets it as your default sink through PipeWire's `default.audio.sink` metadata,
the same key `wpctl set-default` writes, and restores your previous default on exit.

### What you get, and what you do not

The window builds and runs on Linux (`crucible`), and so does `crucible-run`, a console
runner over the same engine that lists the applications it can see, takes positions, and reports
which output it chose and why. Building the window needs Qt 6.8 or later with Quick, Quick
Controls 2, Widgets and Linguist Tools; Quick 3D is optional and adds the 3D room, Qt SVG is
optional and adds the SVG-only icons.

Application icons come from the icon theme. An application gets one when it names an icon
through PipeWire (`application.icon-name`), when a `.desktop` entry matches it — by its Flatpak
application id, or by `Exec`, `TryExec`, `StartupWMClass` or `Name` — or when the theme has an
icon named after its binary. A script, an interpreter or a command-line player (`python3`, `sh`,
`aplay`) has none of those, and shows the monogram.

```

Two things worth knowing before you start:

- **The full-screen rule is off under Wayland.** The rule makes the full-screen application the
  bed. Under X11 it is on: Crucible reads the active window's `_NET_WM_STATE` and `_NET_WM_PID`
  through libxcb. No Wayland client can ask which window is full-screen — that is Wayland's
  security model — so there the rule is off, and the Room page says which reason applies
  (Wayland, no display, or a build without libxcb) rather than silently dropping the rule.
- **The bitstream path has been read off a receiver, on one machine.** WirePlumber enables a
  sink's compressed codecs from the display's own EDID (the `iec958.codecs` property), so on a
  receiver that advertises them nothing needs configuring by hand — and Crucible only offers a
  bitstream mode on a sink that has them. On 2026-09-05, on a Raspberry Pi 4B, the receiver's own
  front panel read **5.1 DD+** from a pre-encoded fixture and **Atmos/DD+** at 7.1 from
  Crucible's engine with a key loaded and an application placed. That is one machine and one
  receiver; nothing says how another behaves.

## macOS

Builds, and no release publishes it. The library's Core Audio process tap and device watcher, and
Crucible's macOS platform half, are in the tree and build. Both macOS CI legs compile and link
them, run the test suites, the window's Qt Quick suites among them, and package the application
as `iclforge-crucible-<version>-Darwin.zip`, whose contents `tools/ci/check_crucible_package.py`
checks. That archive is a CI artifact and no release asset: a release's macOS package is the
universal disk image of the runtime component. Beyond that nothing has run on a Mac. A hosted
runner has a virtual sound device and a window session, and on the Apple Silicon one the first
process tap never returned from `AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID`. The backend now refuses the tap
unless `ICLFORGE_MACOS_PROCESS_TAP` is set in the environment, so on macOS Crucible lists the
applications using sound and taps none of them. Nothing has been captured, played or launched on a
desktop Mac. The route is a source build with `-DICLFORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE=ON`, the same as those
two CI legs use, or that CI archive.

It needs no driver when it runs: macOS process taps mute an application where they capture it, so
there's no silent device to install and no default output to move. What's still needed: a Mac
with a desktop and an audio device, and a run to find out whether the consent prompt needs a
Developer ID certificate. On a hosted runner an unsigned binary was given a tap with no prompt.

[The plan](design/promotion.md) has the detail.

## First run

The first time Crucible opens, a dialog says what it is about to do to your sound settings
before it does it. It names the silent device this platform uses ("Crucible Silent Output" on
Windows, "Crucible (silent)" on Linux), says that your default output will move to it so that every
application plays into it and Crucible taps each one there, and that the previous default is put
back when Crucible quits. If there is no silent device yet, it says how this platform gets one,
and on Windows repeats what stands in the way of loading the driver.

Three ways out:

- **Send applications to …** moves the default output now. On Linux this also creates the node
  if it is not there yet.
- **Not now** changes nothing; the same button on the Room rail and the Signal path page does
  the move later.
- **Open Settings** goes to the Settings page, where the silent device's state and the install
  tools live.

A tick in the dialog, "Do this every time Crucible starts", is the Behaviour setting *Move the
default output to the silent device on launch*, and can be changed in Settings at any time. The
dialog is shown once per user; closing it by any route, Escape included, counts as seen. A
machine whose settings were carried over from the Desktop Atmos demo sees it once too, and the
dialog says so, because the demo never explained this.

The header then shows the path as a single line, in capitals — `APPS → STEREO · YOUR RECEIVER ·
5.1 BED ONLY`, or `⚠ APPS HEARD DIRECT → …` while the default output is still a device you can
hear — and the Room rail carries the one button that fixes it.

Quitting restores the previous default output when Crucible moved it; a default you moved by
hand is left where you put it. Quitting means quitting from the tray, or closing the window with
"Keep running in the tray" off — closing it while that setting is on only hides the window, so
applications stay on the silent device until you quit or press Restore. On a session with no
tray there is no such setting and closing the window is quitting; see
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#there-is-no-tray-icon).

On a platform that never moves the default, the dialog says that nothing in the sound settings
changes and offers no Send. macOS is written to be that platform — the dialog already computed
this case, and a macOS CI suite reads that answer, so no QML changed for it — but no Mac has
shown the dialog to anybody.

## A signing key, on any platform

Without one, Crucible streams 5.1 and your placements pan within the bed; height does nothing.
With one, you get Atmos objects.

Point Settings at a key file, or set the same environment variable `forge` reads:

```bash
export ICLFORGE_SIGNING_KEY_FILE=/path/to/key
```

Crucible stores the *path*, never the key material. Plaintext key material never reaches a
settings file, a log or a crash dump, and the diagnostics file Settings can save carries neither
the key nor the path to it (see
[Saving a diagnostics file](troubleshooting.md#saving-a-diagnostics-file)).
