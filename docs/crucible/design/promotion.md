# Promoting the demo to AC3Forge Crucible

**This is a design record, not a guide.** It documents *why* and *how* Crucible was built, phase
by phase — for using the application today, see [What it is](../index.md) and
[Install and first run](../install.md) instead.

!!! info "Names"
    The record keeps the names of the time it describes: AC3Forge Crucible, `ac3crucible`,
    `ac3forge`, the `AC3FORGE_` variables and the `ac3::` namespaces. The application is Crucible,
    `crucible`, in the family ICL Forge; [Renamed](../../renamed.md) puts each old name beside its
    new one.

!!! success "Where this stands: built and run on Windows and Linux; written but not run on macOS"
    Written 2026-09-04 as a plan, and kept as the record of the work. Crucible exists, runs on
    Windows and Linux, and reached a real receiver over PipeWire on 2026-09-05. What is open is
    on macOS, where the platform half compiles, runs its test suites in CI and has never been
    launched on a Mac, and at the driver, which is test-signed only.
    [Where each phase stands](#where-each-phase-stands) says which parts are built and which are
    only designed.

    The page plans the promotion of the Windows Desktop Atmos Demo
    ([`docs/platforms/windows-demo.md`](../../platforms/windows-demo.md)) into **AC3Forge
    Crucible**, a desktop application on Windows, Linux and macOS. Design sections say what
    changes and why, each phase carries an exit criterion and its progress record, and
    [What cannot be verified](#what-cannot-be-verified-and-why) says which claims this work
    cannot make.

The demo works. It taps every application playing on a Windows PC, lets each be dragged to a
position in a room, and streams the result as live E-AC-3 JOC to a receiver. Four things keep it
short of being a product: it is named after a trademark it does not own, it exists only on
Windows, it is documented as a footnote under Platform notes, and half its engine is welded to
`platform/windows/` headers. This page is the work that closes each of those.

## Where each phase stands

The phase records further down are dated and stay as they were written. This table says what is
built and what is not, against the tree today.

| Phase | Built | Designed, or not settled |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Identity | The rename to `apps/crucible`, `ac3crucible`, `ac3::crucible` and `AC3FORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE`, and the settings migration from the demo; the driver's own names on 2026-10-01 (`IclForgeNullSink`, the endpoint "Crucible Silent Output": [Coordination](#coordination-with-the-driver-signing-session)) | |
| 2. The seams | `AudioDevices`, `SessionMonitor`, `Foreground`, `DefaultDevice` and `VirtualDevice`, with one `platform/<os>/` definition each | |
| 3. Library, Linux | `Capture::start_process_loopback` and `DeviceWatcher` over PipeWire | |
| 4. Linux platform half | All four seams, the silent device as a PipeWire node, X11 full-screen detection, icons from the theme and `.desktop` entries, the window, and a run on a Raspberry Pi 4B | X11 full-screen detection has been tested over a fake reader only; XRes pid validation is named and not taken; the upstream report for the Qt tray bug is not recorded |
| 5. macOS | Both halves are written and compile, and the window's Qt Quick suites drive the seams on both macOS CI legs | The process tap is refused unless `AC3FORGE_MACOS_PROCESS_TAP` is set, since its first run hung; nothing has been launched, captured or played on a Mac; the full-screen check (`CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`) is not written; the signal path's first station is still drawn where no silent device is needed |
| 6. Product qualities | The first-run dialog, restore on quit, the diagnostics file, licence notices per platform, the accessibility pass, right-to-left layout, and six filled catalogues | A review of the six machine-made languages by a reader of each; a screen-reader pass (none has been run); keys for the 3D camera and for one side of a split pair |
| 7. Docs | This guide | |
| 8. CI and packaging | The Windows zip, the Linux tarball and `.deb` on x86_64 and aarch64, and a macOS archive as a CI artifact | No release has carried a Crucible package: the one release, `v0.10.0-beta.1`, is older than the rename. The Windows driver is in no package |
| 9. Verification | On the Pi: the Linux tap, the silent device, and a bitstream over PipeWire that a receiver decoded | A Windows bitstream to a receiver; the driver on a normal machine; macOS at runtime |

The window's Qt Quick suites are 16 files and 141 cases today
([feature coverage](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/apps/crucible/ui/tests/FEATURE_COVERAGE.md)).

## The name

The app becomes **AC3Forge Crucible**. Binary `ac3crucible`, namespace `ac3::crucible`, CMake
option `AC3FORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE`, ctest label `crucible`, virtual device "Crucible" in the
system sound picker.

Two reasons, in order of weight.

**The current name is a trademark it does not own.** "Desktop Atmos Demo" and "Desktop Atmos
Speakers" use Dolby's registered trademark as the name of a product and of a system-wide audio
*device*. Describing a stream as Dolby Atmos where that is what it factually is remains correct
and stays. Naming the application and the endpoint with it does not survive the move from demo
to product, and the endpoint name is the sharper problem of the two, because it is what appears
in every user's sound settings. The demo page already lists the name as an open question; this
settles it before the driver's attestation signing is paid for, since the device name is inside
the package that gets signed.

**A crucible is where separate materials are combined under heat into one melt**, which is what
the application does to the sounds on a desk. It sits in the forge metaphor the project already
uses, it is distinctive enough to find instantly in a device list, and it names the place the
work happens rather than the result.

What the rename touches is [Phase 1](#phase-1-identity).

## What promotion requires

The gap between what exists and a product, in the order the phases take them. This section and
the three after it ([What is already portable](#what-is-already-portable), [The silent device, per
platform](#the-silent-device-per-platform) and [Library additions](#library-additions)) describe
the code as it stood on 2026-09-04, before Phase 1. The phase records say what changed.

| Area | Where it stands | What promotion needs |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | `ac3desk`, `ac3::windemo`, "Desktop Atmos Speakers" | one name, applied to namespace, targets, packages, translations, device and docs |
| Engine portability | `AudioDevices` seam done; four couplings to `platform/windows/` remain | four more seams, and a `platform/<os>/` tree |
| Library backends | `process_loopback` and `device_watch` on Windows only | PipeWire and CoreAudio implementations; a corrected capability report |
| The silent device | Windows driver, test-signed | Linux null sink (no driver); macOS tap mute (no driver); Windows attestation signing |
| Product qualities | a demo's first-run, no diagnostics, mechanical translations | first run, log export, settings migration, accessibility, licence notices |
| Docs | one 89 KB design record under Platform notes | its own docs section with a user guide, per-platform install and troubleshooting |
| CI and packaging | built, tested and packaged on Windows | the same on three platforms |
| Verification | Windows workstation and a throwaway guest | a hardware matrix, and a clear statement where there is none |

## Platform feasibility

The application needs four things from an operating system. It is worth setting them out
separately, because the platforms fail and succeed at different ones, and because two of the
four turn out to need no driver anywhere except Windows.

1. **Enumerate** which applications are playing, with a name and an icon.
2. **Tap** each one separately, without the others.
3. **Silence** their direct output, so the only thing heard is what this application emits.
4. **Bitstream** the encoded result to a receiver in a format it will accept.

| | Windows | Linux (PipeWire) | macOS | Android | WASM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Enumerate | `IAudioSessionManager2` | PipeWire registry | `kAudioHardwarePropertyProcessObjectList` | partial | no |
| Tap | process loopback, build 20348+ | link to the app's node | `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap` | opt-in only | no |
| Silence | **null-sink driver** | **null sink module, no driver** | **tap mute, no driver** | not possible | no |
| Bitstream | WASAPI exclusive | ALSA `iec958` (confirmed) / PipeWire | CoreAudio | confirmed on Shield | no |
| Verdict | **done** | **all four, cheapest** | **all four, unverifiable** | premise breaks at 3 | premise breaks at 1 |

**Linux is the cheapest platform and the only fully verifiable one.** PipeWire's registry names
every stream with its application name and process id; a capture stream links to an
application's output node the way `pw-record --target` and OBS's per-application capture do;
and the silent device is `support.null-audio-sink`, a module load rather than a kernel driver,
so the entire signing problem that gates Windows does not exist. Passthrough over ALSA `iec958`
is the one part of this project already confirmed against a real Atmos receiver
([Raspberry Pi](../../platforms/raspberry-pi.md#live-hdmi-passthrough-to-a-real-receiver), 2026-08-20).

**macOS needs no driver either, which was not obvious.** `CATapDescription` carries a
`muteBehavior`, and `.mutedWhenTapped` routes a process's audio through the tap instead of to
the output device. That is the same job the Windows null-sink driver exists to do, done by the
capture API itself. So macOS needs no kernel extension, no AudioServerPlugIn and no
BlackHole-style HAL plugin — a large cost that a first reading of the problem would have
assumed. What macOS does still need is in
[What cannot be verified](#what-cannot-be-verified-and-why), and none of it is a driver.

**Android and WASM are out.** Android breaks at step 3: an Android device cannot be made the
system output for other applications, and `AudioPlaybackCapture` only reaches applications that
opted in. A browser breaks at step 1. Neither is a reduced version of this application; both
would be different applications, and the Shield app already occupies the Android side of the
project. They stay out of scope, recorded in [Not in scope](#deliberately-not-in-scope).

## What is already portable

The demo was built with the seam in it, which is why this is a promotion rather than a rewrite.

`apps/windows/engine/audio_devices.hpp` declares an abstract factory — `render_devices()` plus
`BurstSink`, `PcmSink`, `ObjectSink` and `TapSource` — and the production implementation
(`platform/windows/wasapi_devices.cpp`, 146 lines) forwards to `ac3::audio`. The fakes in
`tests/windemo/fake_devices.hpp` script endpoints and record submissions, so the frame loop,
the five output routes, the bypass fold and a mid-stream mode switch already run in a plain
Catch2 process on a Linux CI leg that has no audio hardware. Seventy-two cases run there today,
with five more driving the window itself where Qt is present.

So the Linux and macOS work is: implement that same factory over PipeWire and over CoreAudio.
The engine above it does not change.

Four couplings remain, and they are the whole of [Phase 2](#phase-2-the-seams):

| Coupled file | Includes | What it needs |
|---|---|---|
| `engine/engine.cpp` | `platform/windows/session_monitor.hpp`, `foreground.hpp` | a `SessionMonitor` and a `Foreground` interface |
| `runner/main.cpp` | `platform/windows/default_device.hpp` | a `DefaultDevice` interface |
| `ui/desk_controller.cpp` | `default_device.hpp`, `driver_tools.hpp` | both of the above |
| `ui/desk_controller.hpp` | `driver_tools.hpp` | a `VirtualDevice` interface, in a **header** |

The last is the one that bites: a Windows-only type in a UI controller's header means the
controller cannot compile anywhere else, so it takes the interface first.

## The silent device, per platform

The single largest difference between the platforms, and the reason Windows was the hard one to
do first rather than the easy one.

**Windows** keeps its ACX driver, `Ac3ForgeNullSink` when this was written and `IclForgeNullSink`
since 2026-10-01 ([its own page](../../platforms/windows-driver-acx.md)). It is built, test-signed
and Code-Analysed in CI, and verified in a throwaway guest. It loads only where test signing is on
until an EV certificate and attestation submission exist. Nothing in this plan changes that; the
driver's device name changed with the rename, which was [a coordination
point](#coordination-with-the-driver-signing-session).

**Linux** loads a null sink. No driver, no signing, no elevation: a PipeWire
`support.null-audio-sink` node the application creates and tears down, or an existing one the
user points it at. This removes, on Linux, every step that makes the Windows path
high-friction. The application still needs the default sink moved to it, which is the
`default.audio.sink` metadata key.

**macOS** uses `muteBehavior = .mutedWhenTapped` on the process tap, so there is no separate
device at all: each tapped application is silenced at the point it is tapped, individually,
which is a cleaner model than either of the other two. The application never becomes the
default output and never moves the user's default device, so the whole "restore the previous
default on exit" concern disappears on macOS.

One consequence worth stating: **the three platforms silence differently enough that the UI's
signal path must say so.** The demo's three-station path ("applications play to", "Crucible",
"you hear it on") is a Windows story. On macOS the first station is per-application, and the
component needs to render that, not a device name. That is a UI change, not just a backend one,
and it is in [Phase 4](#phase-4-linux-platform-half) and [Phase 5](#phase-5-macos).

## Library additions

`ac3::audio`'s capability report is the contract, and one of its strings is currently wrong.
`process_loopback`'s reason on every non-Windows backend reads "no other backend has an
equivalent". PipeWire has had one for years and macOS has had one since 14.2, so that text
became false and is corrected as part of this work whatever else lands.

| Capability | windows | pipewire | alsa | macos | android | posix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `capture` | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | no |
| `passthrough` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no |
| `monitor` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no |
| `spatial` | yes | **no, and no plan** | no | **no, and no plan** | no | no |
| `process_loopback` | yes | **Phase 3** | no, no per-app concept | **Phase 5, then refused** | no | no |
| `device_watch` | yes | **Phase 3** | no, would be a udev listener | **Phase 5** | no | no |

The macOS `process_loopback` cell says two things because two things happened. It was written in
Phase 5, and since 2026-09-06 it reports **not available**: the first machine ever to run the
path never returned from `AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID` on the tap's aggregate device. The refusal,
the observation behind it and the `AC3FORGE_MACOS_PROCESS_TAP` opt-in that reverses it are in
`libs/audio/src/backend/macos/coreaudio_names.hpp`; the stack is in the
[Phase 5](#phase-5-macos) record.

### ALSA or PipeWire

`ac3audio` compiles **exactly one** backend, and on Linux that is ALSA whenever both sets of
headers are present — which is most desktops, and the Raspberry Pi this project verifies on.
That default is right for the library, whose discriminating feature is passthrough: ALSA
expresses the IEC 60958 non-audio bit as arguments on a device name and works the moment the
hardware does, while a PipeWire sink only offers a compressed codec once WirePlumber's
`iec958Codecs` has been populated, which the library cannot do on a caller's behalf
([Why ALSA still comes first](../../building.md#why-alsa-still-comes-first)).

It is the wrong default for **Crucible**, and not by a little. The application's whole premise is
tapping each application separately, and ALSA has no per-application concept — its
`process_loopback` is a flat no rather than a gap waiting to be filled. So Crucible on Linux is
a PipeWire build or it is nothing.

Two consequences follow, and both are uncomfortable enough to be worth stating rather than
discovering.

**A default build would be silently broken.** The Linux platform half talks to PipeWire directly,
independently of which backend the library chose, so on an ALSA build the application would still
enumerate applications, still draw them in the room, still move the default device — and never
capture a single one of them, because `Capture::start_process_loopback()` would refuse. That is a
worse failure than not building at all, so `apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt` makes it a configure
error naming the two flags that fix it.

**Crucible on Linux inherits the passthrough path that is *not* confirmed.** The Pi's August run
against a real Atmos receiver — every stream shape locked and identified, zero underruns — was
ALSA. Forcing PipeWire trades that for a path this project has never once seen work against
hardware, and which additionally needs a WirePlumber codec rule the user has to supply. So
DR9's PipeWire row sits **on Crucible's critical path on
Linux**, and the first hardware run has to answer it. Until it does, the position is that
Crucible can tap applications on Linux and may have nowhere to send the result. The first hardware
run answered it on 2026-09-05 ([Phase 4](#phase-4-linux-platform-half)): a receiver read "5.1 DD+"
from a bitstream sent over PipeWire, and "Atmos/DD+" from Crucible's own engine with a key loaded.

`spatial` is the one capability with no cross-platform answer. `SpatialObjectSink` wraps
Windows' `ISpatialAudioObjectRenderStream`; neither Linux nor macOS exposes an OS object
renderer a third party can hand Atmos objects to. On those platforms the headphone route
decodes and folds instead, and the mode table loses its Headphones row. The roadmap already
rules an in-repo binaural renderer out of scope and this plan does not reopen it.

## Phases

Each ends with something that runs and a written exit criterion, in the order they unblock each
other. Phases 1 to 4 were the first, overnight tranche; 5 onward were recorded so that the shape
was complete.

### Phase 1: identity

The rename, mechanically and completely: `apps/crucible/windows/` to `apps/crucible/`, `ac3::windemo` to
`ac3::crucible`, `ac3desk` to `ac3crucible`, `ac3windemo` to the same binary's console mode,
`tests/windemo/` to `apps/crucible/engine/tests/`, `AC3FORGE_BUILD_WINDEMO` to `AC3FORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE`,
the `desk`/`windemo` ctest labels to `crucible`, `ac3desk_*.ts` to `ac3crucible_*.ts`, the CPack
component and its archive name, and `tools/ci/check_windemo_package.py` with them.

**Exit:** all cases green under the new labels; the package check passes against a local
`cpack`; no occurrence of `windemo`, `ac3desk` or "Desktop Atmos" outside the CHANGELOG, the
records, and the driver subtree. The driver's own naming is held back — see
[Coordination](#coordination-with-the-driver-signing-session).

!!! success "Done 2026-09-04"
    The tree moved (`apps/crucible/windows/{engine,runner,ui,translations,spikes}` to `apps/crucible/`,
    `tests/windemo/` to `apps/crucible/engine/tests/`), the namespace with it (`ac3::windemo` to
    `ac3::crucible`, and the window's own `ac3::desk` to `ac3::crucible::ui`), the binaries
    became `ac3crucible` and `ac3crucible-run`, and the option, CPack component, archive name,
    coverage script, CI matrix flag and ctest labels (`windemo` and `desk` to `crucible` and
    `crucible-ui`) followed. Baseline before: 72 `windemo` plus 5 `desk`, full suite green.
    After: 72 `crucible` plus 5 `crucible-ui`, full suite green in 134 s.

    Three things the rename turned up. **The settings store is not where the application name
    said it was**: the window sets `setApplicationName("Desktop Atmos")` but the controller
    builds its `QSettings` with the four-argument constructor and the application name
    `DesktopAtmos`, no space — so a migration keyed to the displayed name would have quietly
    lost every signing-key path and endpoint choice. The migration in `ui/main.cpp` uses the
    four-argument form for the same reason the controller does, which also makes it a no-op
    under the QML tests' INI isolation. **The About box credited the wrong sample**: it named
    Microsoft's Simple Audio Sample, true of the PortCls miniport but not of the ACX driver
    that replaced it on 2026-09-04; corrected to the AudioCodec ACX sample, which is what the
    driver's own README and version resource say. And **`.github/` was invisible to the first
    sweep**, because the exclusion list held `.git` and `'.github'.startswith('.git')`; the
    workflow was rewritten in a second pass.

### Phase 2: the seams

Extract `SessionMonitor`, `Foreground`, `DefaultDevice` and `VirtualDevice` as interfaces beside
`AudioDevices`, move the Windows implementations behind them, and add fakes for each to
`apps/crucible/engine/tests/`. `platform_services.hpp` gains one factory per seam, one
`platform/<os>/` definition each, and `wasapi_devices()` is renamed
`platform_audio_devices()` with it, so nothing above the seam names an operating system.

The fourth seam is a bigger change than the other three and is taken separately, as **Phase 2b**.
`SessionMonitor`, `Foreground` and `DefaultDevice` are pure relocations: the Windows code moves
behind an interface and the callers dereference a pointer instead of calling a free function,
with no change to what anything displays. `VirtualDevice` is not. The UI currently shows
`testSigningOn`, `memoryIntegrityOn` and `codeIntegrityKnown` as properties of their own, and
those are facts about a Windows kernel that have no counterpart on either other platform — Linux
loads a module and macOS has no silent device at all. Generalising the seam therefore means
changing what the Settings page shows, not merely where it comes from: the three booleans
collapse into `SilentDeviceState`'s `blocker` and `detail` text, and the QML and its tests move
with them.

**Exit (2a):** `engine.cpp` and `runner/main.cpp` include no `platform/<os>/` header; the engine
and its tests build and run on a Linux CI leg; the three new fakes are exercised by at least one
case each.

**Exit (2b):** the UI controller's *header* includes no `platform/<os>/` header, which is the
coupling that stops it compiling anywhere else; the Settings page reads `SilentDeviceState`
rather than three Windows booleans; the QML tests move with them.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-04"
    All four seams are in. Nothing in `apps/crucible/` above `engine/src/platform/` names an
    operating system: `platform_services.hpp` hands back an `AudioDevices`, a `SessionMonitor`,
    a `Foreground`, a `DefaultDevice` and a `VirtualDevice`, one `platform/<os>/` definition
    each, and `apps/crucible/engine/tests/platform_services_stub.cpp` answers inertly where no platform half
    is built.

    2b was the one that changed the window rather than only its plumbing. `SettingsPage.qml` had
    been composing the Windows advice itself out of `testSigningOn`, `memoryIntegrityOn` and
    `codeIntegrityKnown` — "turn test signing on (`bcdedit /set testsigning on`, then restart)
    and turn memory integrity off ..." — a sentence with no counterpart on either other
    platform. It is composed in `WindowsVirtualDevice` now, where those facts are read, and the
    view prints `silentDeviceBlocker`. A platform with nothing in the way sends an empty
    blocker; one that needs no silent device at all sends `needed = false` and the Settings
    block hides itself, which is what macOS will do.

    Two smaller decisions. `SilentDeviceQuery` carries the two facts that come from
    `DefaultDevice` — whether a matching endpoint exists and whether it is the default — rather
    than having `VirtualDevice` enumerate endpoints a second time. And `set_package_dir()`
    defaults to a no-op, so the two platforms that do not install from a built package need not
    implement it.

    Full suite green: 82 `crucible` cases, and all five `crucible-ui` QML suites, which are the
    ones this phase put at risk.

### Phase 3: library, Linux

`Capture::start_process_loopback` and `DeviceWatcher` in the PipeWire backend; `DeviceWatcher`
in the ALSA backend where it is expressible; the corrected capability strings everywhere.

The mechanism, checked against PipeWire's own documentation rather than assumed: a capture is a
`pw_stream` in `PW_DIRECTION_INPUT` whose properties carry `PW_KEY_TARGET_OBJECT` set to the
target node's `PW_KEY_OBJECT_SERIAL` (or its `PW_KEY_NODE_NAME`), connected with
`PW_STREAM_FLAG_AUTOCONNECT`. Targeting an application's own output node is the per-application
tap; `PW_KEY_STREAM_CAPTURE_SINK` set to `"true"` is the whole-sink monitor variant, which is
the ordinary loopback this backend already wants elsewhere. There is a shipped reference for
the per-application case — OBS's `obs-pipewire-audio-capture` plugin does exactly this — so the
question for this phase is fitting it to `Capture`'s existing shape, not whether it can be done.

**Exit:** `audio_backend()` reports `process_loopback` and `device_watch` on PipeWire; the
backend contract test exercises both without touching a device, as it does on Windows; builds
clean in the WSL2 loop with `-DAC3FORGE_WITH_ALSA=OFF -DAC3FORGE_WITH_PIPEWIRE=ON`.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-05"
    Both landed. `Capture::start_process_loopback()` walks the registry for the
    `Stream/Output/Audio` node whose `application.process.id` matches — a value the daemon fills
    in from the client's credentials, so it is the kernel's answer and not the client's claim —
    and links a capture stream to it through `PW_KEY_TARGET_OBJECT`. `DeviceWatcher` turns the
    registry's `global`/`global_remove` into added and removed, keeping an id-to-device-id map
    because `global_remove` carries only the number; the default changing is not a registry
    event at all, so it binds PipeWire's `default` metadata object and listens to its `property`
    event, which is where `default.audio.sink` lives and how `wpctl` reads it.

    Two refusals are deliberate rather than unfinished. `kExcludeProcessTree` has no counterpart
    here: PipeWire links a stream to a target, and assembling "everything except this one" out
    of the rest of the graph would mean following every node that came and went for the life of
    the tap. And a process that owns no audio stream is `kProcessNotFound`, not a tap that
    delivers silence for ever, which is what a stream linked to nothing does.

    **Both capabilities are the machine's answer, not the build's**, and the contract test is
    what forced that. It requires `audio_backend().process_loopback.available` to equal
    `process_loopback_available()` on every platform. A hardcoded `true` would have disagreed on
    any container or CI runner, where the library is built against libpipewire but no session
    daemon is running — so the PipeWire table is computed once at first use, the way the Windows
    one already is for its build-number check. The contract's device-watch case also gained a
    second refusal: a backend can be unavailable because it was never built, or because the
    session it needs is not running, and those are different facts.

    One claim was corrected wherever it appeared: every non-Windows backend said per-process
    loopback had "no other backend has an equivalent", which stopped being true when PipeWire
    gained per-node capture and macOS shipped Core Audio process taps in 14.2.

    `Capture::start()` and the new tap now share `Impl::connect_stream()`; only the target and
    the format differed.

    Verified by compiling and running on Linux, in the WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04 loop against
    libpipewire-0.3 1.6.2 and GCC 15.2, with `-DAC3FORGE_WITH_ALSA=OFF
    -DAC3FORGE_WITH_PIPEWIRE=ON`. **What that does not establish**: WSL2 has no PipeWire session,
    so every path here took its "no session" arm. A tap actually delivering one application's
    audio, and a watcher actually reporting a default change, wait on a desktop Linux session —
    the Pi is the machine for it, and it is the same run DR9's PipeWire row needs.

### Phase 4: Linux platform half

`platform/linux/`: `pipewire_devices()` behind `AudioDevices`; the session monitor over the
PipeWire registry, where a stream node already carries `application.name` and
`application.process.id`, so the process-tree walk Windows needs has no counterpart here; the
default-sink move and restore through the `default.audio.sink` metadata key; null-sink create
and tear-down; and application icons from `.desktop` entries and the icon theme. The foreground full-screen check is X11-only and refuses
cleanly under Wayland, which has no way for one client to ask about another's windows — a real
gap, stated in the UI rather than worked around.

**Exit:** `ac3crucible` builds and starts on Linux; the console runner taps two applications,
places one, and encodes; the signal path renders with the null sink as the default.

!!! note "Started 2026-09-05: the AudioDevices half is done, the four seams are not"
    Phase 4 turned out to be smaller than this plan assumed, because one of the five services
    was never platform-specific in the first place. `platform/windows/wasapi_devices.cpp` named
    no Windows API at all: `PassthroughSink`, `MonitorSink`, `SpatialObjectSink` and `Capture`
    are the library's own cross-platform classes, and `enumerate_render_devices()` and
    `probe_spatial_capability()` answer for whichever backend was built. So it moves up to
    `engine/library_devices.cpp` and every platform gets it, rather than each writing a twin.
    A platform that cannot do one of these gets the refusal from the library: a Linux build has
    no spatial backend, so the object sink fails to start and the output policy never chooses
    the headphone route.

    **What Phase 4 still needs**, all four under `platform/linux/`, and each with a decision in
    it rather than only work:

    - **`SessionMonitor`** — a registry walk for `Stream/Output/Audio` nodes, which
      `pipewire_support.hpp` now has the helpers for (`is_output_stream`, `node_process_id`,
      `node_application_name`). The closest to ready. Windows groups sessions by process tree
      because a browser's audio comes from a utility process; PipeWire tags each stream with the
      client's own pid, so that walk has no counterpart here and the grouping question needs
      re-answering rather than porting.
    - **`DefaultDevice`** — endpoints come from the library's own
      `enumerate_render_devices()`; reading and writing the default is the `default.audio.sink`
      metadata key, which means a metadata write from the application rather than a read-only
      registry walk.
    - **`Foreground`** — X11 can answer through `_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN`, at the cost of a
      libX11 dependency; Wayland cannot answer at all. The `ForegroundSupport` reason field
      exists for exactly this, so the first cut refuses on both and X11 is a follow-up.
    - **`VirtualDevice`** — loading and unloading a `support.null-audio-sink` module.
      No driver, no signing, no elevation, but it is a module load from inside the application
      rather than anything the library already does.

    The application also gains a direct PipeWire dependency on Linux for three of those four,
    which is the same shape Windows already has: the app talks to COM and WASAPI itself for
    session enumeration and the default device, because those are demo policy rather than audio
    I/O. Consistent, but worth naming, since the library otherwise keeps PipeWire entirely to
    itself.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-05: the engine runs on Linux"
    All four seams are written, `apps/crucible` builds on Linux, and `ac3crucible-run` starts,
    runs its frame loop at the 32 ms cadence and answers `status` and `list`. On a machine with
    no PipeWire session everything degrades by saying so: "no render endpoint can carry any
    mode", no signing key, no applications. The root guard is now
    `WIN32 OR (UNIX AND NOT APPLE)`; macOS is excluded until Phase 5 gives it a platform half,
    rather than being allowed to configure and then fail to link. (Superseded 2026-09-06: Phase
    5's application half landed and the guard is now `WIN32 OR APPLE OR LINUX`. The reason for
    having a guard at all is unchanged — a platform with no arm in
    `apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt` would configure and then fail to link.)

    Two decisions were taken rather than deferred, both stated in the code:

    **The full-screen check does not take libX11.** Wayland gives a client no way to ask which
    window is full-screen — that is its security model, not a gap, and no portal exposes it — so
    X11 would be a dependency for a rule that half of Linux desktops can never honour. The Linux
    `Foreground` refuses on both and says which of the two reasons applies. Reporting "nothing is
    full-screen" instead would have been a different and wrong claim: the engine would quietly
    stop pinning a full-screen game to the bed and nobody would be told why. X11 stays a purely
    additive follow-up, which is what `ForegroundSupport` exists to allow.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-05: X11 full-screen detection"
    The follow-up the previous block left open is taken. The Linux `Foreground` answers under
    X11 and refuses, with the reason, everywhere else; the window, the runner and the probe
    now print that reason instead of only the docs saying it. Four decisions, each stated in
    the code:

    **libxcb, linked directly through pkg-config, optional.** `ac3crucible_engine` has no Qt,
    and the runner and the probe link it, so Qt's native interface was never reachable from
    where `Foreground` lives; and even in the window it hands over an `xcb_connection_t*`
    whose property reads are libxcb calls anyway. libxcb is thread-safe without
    `XInitThreads`, returns `BadWindow` as a per-request reply rather than through a
    process-global handler, and is already on every machine that runs Qt's xcb platform
    plugin, so the `.deb`'s shlibdeps gain nothing new. `AC3FORGE_CRUCIBLE_X11` (AUTO/ON/OFF)
    follows the audio backends' shape; exactly one of `xcb_window_reader.cpp` and
    `no_xcb_window_reader.cpp` is compiled, and the second says at runtime that the build
    has no X11 support. The configure summary prints `Crucible X11   : xcb|none` and the
    Linux Crucible CI leg asserts `xcb`.

    **The read moved onto the session-monitor thread, on every platform.** `fullscreen_pid()`
    is called exactly once in `engine.cpp`, beside `sessions->refresh()`, and the pid is
    handed across `session_mutex` with the list it is matched against, so the frame loop
    never waits on a server round trip and the match is against the processes that existed
    at that instant. The Windows calls have no thread affinity and ride along unchanged.

    **The seat's own word wins in both directions.** `display_session.hpp` classifies from
    `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` first, then `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` or a `wayland-*` socket, then `DISPLAY`;
    an explicit `x11` beats a stale compositor socket (and is how a nested Xephyr on the Pi's
    Wayland seat is told it is X11), Wayland keeps its refusal even with Xwayland's `DISPLAY`
    set, and neither variable at all is a third reason, "no graphical session", rather than
    the wrong X11 one an ssh login used to get.

    **`_NET_WM_PID` validated by `WM_CLIENT_MACHINE`; XRes is the follow-up.** A client in a
    pid namespace (Flatpak, Snap) reports a namespace pid, which matches nothing: a false
    negative, the same as before. `xcb-res` with `XCB_RES_CLIENT_ID_MASK_LOCAL_CLIENT_PID`
    removes it and is named in the reader's header rather than taken now.

    The Linux session monitor's `session_pids` now carries the stream's pid and every
    same-executable ancestor of it (`process_tree.hpp`, the twin of the Windows `root_of()`
    walk, sixteen hops at most), so a browser's window process matches its audio process
    while a full-screen terminal never pins the player it launched; `app` stays the stream
    pid because the tap targets it exactly. `EngineStatus` gained `fullscreen_rule_available`
    and `fullscreen_rule_reason`; the Room note (`fullscreenRuleNote`) reads "The full-screen
    rule is off here: ..." when there is a reason and states the rule otherwise.

    Tested without a display: `[crucible][x11]` cases over a fake reader hold the
    pid-only-while-full-screen rule, the first-use connect and its 20-read retry cadence, a
    lost display and its recovery, the classification table and the ancestor walk; the Room
    note has a Qt Quick case that takes the available branch on Windows and the no-display
    reason on the Linux leg.

    Not run in a real X11 session: the detection is tested over a fake reader, and no run of it
    on the Pi is recorded here. The recipe that would settle it is a nested Xephyr on the Pi's
    Wayland seat (`Xephyr :2`, `openbox`, `mpv --fs`, then the probe with
    `DISPLAY=:2 XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11 WAYLAND_DISPLAY=/tmp/probe 20`): it should print the
    `full-screen pid -> session pid (mpv)` line, then `none` after
    `wmctrl -r mpv -b remove,fullscreen` and `none` for a full-screen xterm running pw-play, and
    the normal Wayland session should still refuse.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-05: the silent device is ephemeral, and the run on the Pi"

    **The silent device is ephemeral, and better for it.** It is a `libpipewire-module-adapter`
    node loaded on the application's own connection with `object.linger=false`, so it exists
    exactly as long as Crucible runs and is gone when it exits. Windows leaves an installed
    driver and an endpoint behind until somebody uninstalls them; on Linux a person who tries
    Crucible and quits has their machine back as they found it, and `remove()` is not an
    uninstall because there is nothing to uninstall. The UI wording for that block should follow
    the difference rather than assume the Windows shape.

    One thing the Linux session monitor drops on purpose. Windows groups audio sessions by
    process tree, because a browser renders its audio from a utility process under the browser;
    PipeWire tags every stream with the client's own `application.process.id` from its
    credentials, so an application is one process id and the walk has no counterpart. What goes
    with it is Windows' `has_window` test — there is no portable way to ask on Linux and no way
    at all under Wayland — so anything with an audio stream is listed. A background process that
    plays sound is rare on a desktop, and listing one is a smaller error than hiding a real
    application.

    **Verified on hardware 2026-09-05**, on the Raspberry Pi 4B this project already uses for
    DR9 — Pi OS 13 (Trixie), kernel 6.18.39, aarch64, PipeWire 1.4.2 with WirePlumber, a live
    Wayland session. `tools/checks/crucible_platform_probe.cpp` exercises each seam against the
    real machine; it is a tool rather than a test because it needs a session, and it is
    read-mostly — it creates and removes the silent device and never moves the default output.

    ```
    process_loopback_available() = true
    session monitor:  pid 30183  pw-play  active=1 session=1
    per-app tap:      116736 frames, 0 silence-filled, 0 dropped
    default device:   alsa_output.platform-fe00b840.mailbox.stereo-fallback
    foreground:       Wayland gives a client no way to ask which window is full-screen
    device watcher:   added ac3forge_crucible_sink / removed ac3forge_crucible_sink   (5 events)
    ```

    The watcher line is the one worth reading twice: an independent client saw the silent device
    arrive and depart, which verifies the watcher and the silent device at once.

    **Five defects, none of which any amount of building could have found.** Every one needed a
    session to exist, and on WSL2 `pw_context_connect()` fails first and the code below it never
    runs.

    1. **The passthrough probe deadlocked on every success.** `probe_connect()` destroyed its
       stream after unlocking the loop but before stopping it — a `pw_stream` call from the wrong
       context, which wedged the loop so the `pw_thread_loop_stop()` that followed never
       returned. This is library code, older than this work, on the path every probe of a real
       node takes: `enumerate_render_devices()` hung the application at startup. The order is
       unlock, stop, destroy, and `Capture::stop()` had it right all along.
    2. **A capture teardown freed the wrong handle.** After the move into the member, the local
       is empty, so the not-ready path destroyed nothing and left a live stream to outlive the
       loop it was created on. Introduced by this work, in the Phase 3 refactor that renamed the
       local to avoid a shadow warning.
    3. **The metadata helper hung on its second round trip.** `pw_core_sync()` returns a fresh
       sequence each time and the `done` handler quits only for the one it expects, so a caller
       that synced and ran the loop itself waited for a sequence nobody was matching. The helper
       owns both round trips now.
    4. **The process id is not on the stream node.** A `Stream/Output/Audio` node carries
       `application.name`, `media.class` and a `client.id` — and no pid. The process is on the
       **Client** object, as `pipewire.sec.pid`, which the daemon takes from the socket
       credentials. Reading `application.process.id` off the node, which is the obvious thing and
       what this work did, matches nothing: the session list was empty for ever and
       `start_process_loopback()` could never find a process to tap. Both the library and the
       application go through `output_stream_nodes()` now, which does the join.
    5. **The silent device did not exist.** `pw_context_load_module()` loads the adapter into
       *this process's own context*: it returns a module, reports no error, and creates a node no
       other client can see, target, or be made to play into. The state query then reported the
       device present on the strength of that module load. It is `pw_core_create_object()` now,
       which asks the daemon for the object, and the state query asks the graph rather than a
       flag. The failure was visible only because the device watcher, which should have seen the
       device arrive, stayed silent.

    Defect 5 is the one worth keeping as a lesson: the code returned success, the state said
    present, and nothing existed. A second, independent observer of the same fact — the watcher —
    is what made the difference between believing it and knowing it.

    **Later the same night the receiver came on**, and the second half of the run followed.

    The kernel saw it at once — `HDMI-A-1: connected`, ELD `monitor_name: AV Receiver`, SADs
    for AC-3 (6 ch), E-AC-3 (8 ch), TrueHD, DTS-HD — and PipeWire did not. WirePlumber had been
    running since 17 August; its hot-plug activation died with "Object activation aborted:
    PipeWire proxy destroyed", `wpctl set-profile` changed nothing, and the card offered only
    `off` and `pro-audio`. A restart of the user's PipeWire services fixed it instantly: the
    proper `hdmi-stereo` profile appeared with `iec958.codecs = [PCM, DTS, AC3, EAC3, TrueHD,
    DTS-HD]` read from the ELD. So the WirePlumber `iec958Codecs` rule this project expected a
    user to write is not needed on a receiver that advertises its codecs; what is needed is a
    session manager that has not been up for three weeks. (A guess along the way — that
    `vc4-hdmi`'s ALSA format being only `IEC958_SUBFRAME_LE` was the cause — was wrong, and is
    recorded so it is not made twice.)

    Then the library's own probe, `enumerate_render_devices()`, against the real graph:

    ```
    *alsa_output.platform-fe00b840.mailbox.stereo-fallback ac3=YES eac3=YES  "Built-in Audio Stereo"
     alsa_output.platform-fef00700.hdmi.hdmi-stereo         ac3=YES eac3=YES  "Digital Stereo (HDMI)"
    ```

    The second line is DR9's PipeWire row answered. The first line is a **false positive**: a
    3.5 mm headphone jack cannot carry a bitstream, and the probe said it could, because the
    connect it makes is accepted by PipeWire's adapter, which would render the bursts as PCM
    noise. Crucible's output policy would have chosen it. Both enumeration and `start()`'s
    auto-pick are now gated on the node's `iec958.codecs`, which is WirePlumber's judgement from
    the sink's own ELD, and the jack — which has none — is never probed.

    `tools/checks/passthrough_probe.cpp` then streamed the 5.1 E-AC-3 fixture to the HDMI sink
    for 25 s: 824 IEC 61937 bursts over 11 loops, 0 dropped. Whether the receiver locked is the
    receiver's display's to say, and that evening it was not read.

!!! success "The receiver's own answer, 2026-09-05 22:20 and 22:22"

    Read off the receiver's front panel by Iain, standing at it, which is the only place this
    answer exists. Both runs went to `alsa_output.platform-fef00700.hdmi.hdmi-stereo`, the sink
    whose `iec958.codecs` WirePlumber had filled from the receiver's own EDID; the analogue jack
    beside it reported `ac3=no eac3=no` throughout, which is the gate working.

    **A pre-encoded 5.1 stream: the receiver read "5.1 DD+".** `passthrough_probe` packed the
    `reference_51_eac3_448k_cplbndstrce0.ec3` fixture into IEC 61937 bursts for 90 s - 2,856
    bursts over 37 loops, 2,813 rendered, 162 underruns while the machine was also compiling.
    No encoder and no signing key are in that path: it reads a file and submits frames. **This
    closes DR9's PipeWire row.** A bitstream from this library, over PipeWire, reaches a real
    receiver and is decoded.

    **Crucible's own engine with objects: the receiver read "Atmos/DD+", at 7.1.**
    `ac3crucible-run
    --key /home/iain/atmos.key --pin atmos`, with one application playing and placed at
    (0.8, 0.3, 0.6) rather than left in the bed. The runner reported `signing key loaded from
    /home/iain/atmos.key: object container will be signed`, `objects=on`, and the mode
    **`Atmos (E-AC-3 JOC over HDMI)`** on that sink; 1,652 frames, 0 underruns. So the whole
    path holds on Linux: a live application tapped through PipeWire, encoded as E-AC-3 with a
    JOC object layer, the object container signed, and a receiver that decodes it as Atmos.

    The 7.1 in that reading is the receiver's, not the stream's: what leaves this machine is a
    5.1 bed with an object layer above it, and the receiver renders those objects to the speakers
    it has. That it reports a layout wider than the bed is the clearest evidence available from
    the front panel that the object layer arrived and was used, rather than the bed being played
    and the objects discarded.

    Two things this still does not say. The display names the format and the layout, not where
    each object was placed, so it is evidence of a valid Atmos bitstream rather than of correct
    positioning - the library's rendered-layout checks are what speak to that. And
    the worst frame in the Atmos run was 1,059 ms, which is the connect stall recorded above:
    that binary predated the fix to the passthrough and monitor paths, and the measurement wants
    taking again on a build that carries it.

    **The window, on Linux.** With Quick 3D, Shader Tools and Linguist Tools installed from apt,
    `ac3crucible` built on the Pi (6.1 MB, aarch64) after one platform split — the application
    icon provider asks the Windows shell for an executable's icon and is the only Windows-only
    file in the UI; its Linux twin returned none and the monogram showed, until Phase 6 gave it the icon theme and the `.desktop` entries. Rendered headless with
    `--shot`, the room, both views, the three-station signal path and the status bar all drew,
    with the encoder at **9.56 ms per frame** on the Pi 4B and zero underruns. The screenshot is
    what exposed the next four defects, which no log had:

    1. **Station 1 said "install the Desktop Atmos driver" and station 2 was labelled "DESKTOP
       ATMOS".** The silent device's name lived in the window as a default rather than in the
       platform that owns it. `VirtualDevice` now carries `device_name()` and
       `how_to_get_one()` — "Desktop Atmos" and the driver advice on Windows, "Crucible (silent)"
       and "Crucible creates it" on Linux — and station 2 is simply Crucible.
    2. **The applications rail listed "ac3forge probe."** Crucible's own probe streams are
       PipeWire streams like any other. Windows never lists another instance of this program;
       the Linux session monitor now skips its own pid.
    3. **The tray was absent, with "Qt Labs Platform requires Qt Widgets".** `Qt.labs.platform`'s
       tray is `QSystemTrayIcon` underneath, a Widgets class; Windows tolerated a
       `QGuiApplication` because its native menu needs no widgets, Linux refused. It is a
       `QApplication` now, on every platform.
    4. **The first frame took 7.1 s** (`worst 7121.5 ms` in the status bar). The output probe ran
       on the frame thread, and on PipeWire every answer is a real connect with a 2 s timeout —
       instant on Windows, seconds here. `OutputStage::reprobe()` is now `enumerate()`, which any
       thread may run, plus `apply()`, which starts and stops sinks and stays on the frame
       thread; the engine runs the first on a probe thread of its own, the same shape as its
       session-monitor thread, and applies the facts at the next frame boundary.

    Two more from the same run's logs. Every `stop()` destroyed its stream *after* stopping the
    loop, which is the right order, but without the loop lock held, which PipeWire's context
    check still wants — "called from wrong context" on every teardown. And the Linux silent
    device's teardown never destroyed its node proxy before the core, which is "impl_ext_end_proxy:
    Device or resource busy". Both fixed; the `rendered` statistic, which had read 0 through a
    run that plainly played because each callback asks for less than one burst and integer
    division per callback rounds to nothing, now accumulates bytes and counts whole bursts.

    **Re-verified on the Pi after these fixes**, 2026-09-05: enumeration reads the headphone jack as `ac3=no eac3=no` and the HDMI sink as `ac3=YES eac3=YES`, from the bound node info rather than the registry dictionary; the window renders with 0 wrong-context warnings and a worst frame of 59 ms; and its own Qt Quick suite passes there (the next section).

    What the Linux window lacked when this was written - application icons and the full-screen
    rule - both landed in Phase 6: icons come from the icon theme and the `.desktop` entries,
    and the rule is answered under X11 and refused, with the reason, under Wayland. Worth
    knowing before the next hardware run: the Pi's own
    checkout sits on `bugfix/vc4-hdmi-device-classification` — HDMI audio classification on
    this exact hardware has bitten the ALSA backend once already.

    **The window's own tests, on Linux — and what they found.** The Qt Quick suite ran on the
    Pi for the first time: four of five passed and the settings suite failed twice, both on the
    same line of thinking. The settings page asserted that pointing the driver folder at a
    place that does not exist means there is no package to install — true on Windows, and
    meaningless on a platform with no package, where the application makes the silent device
    itself and "found" is the platform's word for "can make one". The page was Windows-shaped
    in four places besides: it said applications play into "the Windows default output", named
    "the Desktop Atmos driver" in its own prose, offered a driver folder and `install.ps1`
    advice under Advanced, and labelled its buttons Install driver and Remove driver. The seam
    had the fact (`set_package_dir()` is a no-op on Linux) and nothing told the window, so
    `VirtualDevice` now says it outright — `from_package()`, true on Windows, false on Linux —
    and the page is worded by it: the two-stage note names whatever the platform calls the
    device, the folder and its notes exist only where a package does, and Linux reads Create
    device and Remove device. The tests now open Advanced and assert the shape on both
    platforms rather than skipping one. That took a second lesson: a Qt Quick `TestCase` item
    is invisible by design, an Item's `visible` reads the *effective* value, so nothing
    parented to the test case can ever be seen — the earlier tests only ever read `enabled`
    and `text` and never noticed. The page under test is parented to the window's root item.
    On the Pi, after the fix, all five suites pass — language, output, room (35 s), settings (17 s: seven passed, one skipped by name) and shell — the suite Windows runs in six seconds.

    **Packaging on Linux, from the Pi.** The first `cpack` there died in Qt's own deploy
    script, which `qt_generate_deploy_qml_app_script` runs at install time: on Linux it copies
    the distribution's QML plugins into the package and then fails to rewrite an RPATH they
    never had. WSL2 never reached it, having no Qt. The script is Windows and macOS only now —
    Linux ships no Qt, the loader finds the system's — and the `crucible` component packages
    alone from a build that has built nothing else (`cpack -D CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL=crucible`;
    the runtime component's install rules want a `libac3forge.so` the Pi never built).
    `ac3crucible` links the library statically, so the package is self-contained apart from
    Qt and PipeWire, which `dpkg-shlibdeps` resolves from the binary:
    `ac3forge-crucible-0.0.0-dev-Linux-aarch64.tar.gz`: 16 entries, 7 MB unpacked, 2.8 MB compressed; `check_crucible_package.py` passes, and not one entry under `qml/`.
    `ac3forge-crucible_0.0.0_arm64.deb` (2.8 MB): Package `ac3forge-crucible`, Section sound, Depends `pipewire, wireplumber | pipewire-media-session` plus what shlibdeps read off the binary — libpipewire-0.3, Qt 6 Core/Gui/Qml/Quick/QuickControls2/Widgets, libstdc++6 — and six files: the two binaries, the launcher, the AppStream record and the two icons.

    **CI, the Linux half.** The Linux LLVM leg's Crucible pass no longer stops at the runner.
    It installs distro Qt the way the GUI leg does, builds the window and its test binary,
    runs the engine's Catch2 tags and the PipeWire backend's contract tests in that tree — the
    only place they run on PipeWire — then the Qt Quick suite headless with `--no-tests=error`,
    packages the component, runs `check_crucible_package.py` on the tarball and checks the
    `.deb`'s name, and uploads both as `packages-crucible-<preset>` — the `packages-*` pattern
    that `release.yml`'s "Download package artifacts" step downloads and its "Upload release
    assets" step attaches file by file, so both files are release assets, checksummed, signed
    and attested with every other package.
    No tag has been cut since that landed, so that is what CI is wired to do rather than
    something a published release has been seen to carry. One qualification stays true of the
    route: the leg carries no `release_package`, so the package rides on the artifact glob
    rather than on a release gate. The other — that the leg was x86_64, so no release could
    carry an aarch64 Linux Crucible package — closed on 2026-09-06, and Phase 8 below records
    what closed it. The fleet's Linux image is Ubuntu 26.04 with Qt 6.10; when
    `decide-runner` falls back to GitHub's 24.04 and its Qt 6.4, below the window's 6.8, the
    step warns by name and skips the window half rather than fail the leg for something
    unrelated to the change — and with it the package, which the upload's
    `if-no-files-found: ignore` lets pass quietly, so a release cut on that fallback carries no
    x86_64 Linux Crucible package.

    **The Pulse relay, and what a person sees of it.** Playing something on the Pi found two
    things, one of them a bug with a wrong session list and a tap that captured nothing.

    PipeWire records the process behind a client from the socket credentials, as
    `pipewire.sec.pid` on the Client object, and that is the pid the session list and the tap
    have used since Phase 4. It is the right answer only for a client that talks to the daemon
    itself. An application using the PulseAudio API — VLC, Firefox, Chromium, Spotify, most of a
    Debian desktop — reaches the daemon through `pipewire-pulse`, which owns the socket, so
    every one of their Clients carries `pipewire-pulse`'s pid. Read off the Pi on 2026-09-05:
    VLC's Client said 32005, which was `pipewire-pulse`; VLC was 49692. Believing it lists every
    Pulse application as one entry named after the relay, and points a per-process tap at a
    process that plays nothing.

    The node says which it is. `client.api` is a registry key, `"pipewire-pulse"` there and
    absent or `"pipewire"` for a direct client, and where it names a relay the pid that means
    something is `application.process.id` — which `pipewire-pulse` copies from the Pulse
    client's own proplist. That key is not in the registry subset, so those nodes are now bound
    for their info at either identity depth: the tap needs the pid, and a wrong pid is not an
    identity nicety. A graph with no Pulse application in it still costs the tap what it always
    did, one round trip and no binds. `stream_owner_pid()` and `client_api_is_relay()` carry the
    rule where a test with no session running can reach them.

    The second thing is not a bug and cannot be fixed, only said. Windows keeps an audio session
    while an application holds the device open, so a paused player stays in the list and greys;
    PipeWire has a stream only while there is sound. On Linux applications therefore appear when
    they start playing and leave when they stop, which is not what someone who has used the
    Windows window expects, and the room page had Windows' sentence on it either way. That
    sentence is now `SessionMonitor::listing_rule()`, one paragraph each from the two platforms,
    the same pattern as `VirtualDevice::how_to_get_one()`. `troubleshooting.md` leads with it
    under "An application is not in the list".

    **The tray, and the Qt bug that took it away for a day.** The window would not start on a
    real Linux desktop. Every launch on the Pi died with `SIGBUS` on the main thread, inside
    `libQt6Gui` reached from `libQt6DBus` delivering the panel's `GetLayout` call on the tray's
    `com.canonical.dbusmenu` object. The faulting instruction is an `ldaxr` — a refcount — on a
    pointer holding two AArch64 instruction words.

    The first reading of it was wrong and is worth recording as such: the Pi's compositor is
    labwc, which looked like a session with no host for a StatusNotifierItem, so the fix was
    going to be Qt's own `available` question. It is not one. `wf-panel-pi` owns
    `org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher` on that session and Qt answers yes; the item registers, the
    panel asks for the menu, and the process dies.

    The second reading was wrong too, and that one cost more. Measured over ten launches per arm
    the window survived 0–2 of 10 with the tray and 10 of 10 without, which reads as a race; and
    since a minimal Qt application publishing the same tray and the same menu on the same
    session survived 10 of 10, it read as a race reached through this window's shape. So the
    hunt was for a schedule. Ruled out, each over ten launches: the icon format (SVG and PNG die
    alike, and this system ships no Qt 6 SVG icon engine at all); the menu's contents, with
    every binding replaced by a literal; the application-icon provider and its
    `QIcon::fromTheme` calls; Qt's accessibility bridge; the Qt Quick render loop, basic and
    threaded; PipeWire's RTKit D-Bus client; the engine, which need not be running; the window's
    header, footer, pages, dialogs and announcer, each removed in turn; any symbol this binary
    exports over one Qt resolves, of which there are none; glibc's own heap checking
    (`MALLOC_CHECK_=3`, `glibc.malloc.check=3`); a use-after-free, since the faulting pointer is
    byte-identical with `MALLOC_PERTURB_` set; a Qt version or layout mismatch; and stale
    generated code, since a fresh tree crashes at the same rate.

    All of that is consistent with what it turned out to be, and none of it points at it,
    because a 2 GB Pi could not run the one thing that would: an address sanitiser, or Qt's own
    debug symbols. So the next step was a machine that could.

    **The VM.** [`apps/crucible/linux/tray-vm/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/tree/main/apps/crucible/linux/tray-vm) is a scripted VMware guest,
    the same shape as the Windows driver guest in `apps/crucible/windows/driver-vm/`: Debian 13, which
    carries the Pi's exact Qt (6.8.2) and publishes matching `-dbgsym` packages, on labwc with
    waybar as the panel — the Pi's own stack a step out, since `wf-panel-pi` has no amd64 build
    and waybar is linked against the same `libdbusmenu-gtk3` that makes the call. x86_64, so the
    architecture differs from the Pi's on purpose: if a fault does not cross, that is a finding
    too. `Test-Tray.ps1` builds the window twice, with and without the reproducer, launches each
    ten times and counts.

    It crossed. Same fault, 9–10 deaths in 10, and the signal differs only because the AArch64
    read was an `ldaxr`, which faults unaligned as `SIGBUS` where x86-64 faults unmapped as
    `SIGSEGV`. With `-dbgsym` the backtrace is the whole answer:

    ```
    QDBusPlatformMenu::items                       qdbusplatformmenu.cpp:258
    QDBusMenuLayoutItem::populate(menu,  depth=-2) qdbusmenutypes.cpp:94
    QDBusMenuLayoutItem::populate(item,  depth=-1) qdbusmenutypes.cpp:110
    QDBusMenuLayoutItem::populate(menu,  depth=-1) qdbusmenutypes.cpp:97
    QDBusMenuAdaptor::GetLayout(parentId=0)        qdbusmenuadaptor.cpp:118
    ```

    The item at `qdbusmenutypes.cpp:110` is the "Signal path · auto" `MenuItem`, and its
    `m_subMenu` is a `QWidgetPlatformMenu` — Qt Labs Platform's QWidget fallback — being read as
    a `QDBusPlatformMenu`.

    **It is a type confusion in Qt, and it is not a race.** `QQuickLabsPlatformMenu::create()`
    gives a `Menu` nested inside another `Menu` the handle its parent's handle makes, through
    `QPlatformMenu::createSubMenu()`. `QDBusPlatformMenu` implements no `createSubMenu()`, so the
    base class answers, nothing native comes back, the platform theme's `createPlatformMenu()`
    returns nothing either, and Labs Platform falls through to its own QWidget fallback. Then
    `QDBusPlatformMenuItem::setMenu()` `static_cast`s that to `QDBusPlatformMenu` and writes
    `m_containingMenuItem` through it, off the end of the object — valgrind catches that write
    inside `QQmlObjectCreator::finalize`, before the window is on screen:

    ```
    Invalid write of size 8
       at QDBusPlatformMenuItem::setMenu(QPlatformMenu*)   qdbusplatformmenu.cpp:58
       by  ??? (libQt6LabsPlatform.so.6.8.2)
       by  QQmlObjectCreator::finalize                     qqmlobjectcreator.cpp:1573
       ...
     Address 0x1ea1cd10 is 32 bytes before a block of size 128
    ```

    The bad `static_cast` is then kept, and when the panel asks the tray for its layout,
    `QDBusMenuLayoutItem::populate` reads `QDBusPlatformMenu::m_items` out of a
    `QWidgetPlatformMenu`. The `QList`'s `d` pointer is whatever that object holds at the offset
    — `0xe` in the dump above, two instruction words on the Pi — and refcounting it is the
    crash.

    Which is why it looked like a race and is not one. The read is always wrong; whether it
    faults depends on what the bytes at that offset happen to be. Removing an unrelated QML
    block, or adding a `Qt.callLater` with an empty body, moved it because those change the
    heap, not the schedule — and the minimal application survived because its menu had no
    submenu in it.

    **The fix is the menu's shape.** Measured on the VM, ten launches per arm, 2026-09-06:

    | arm | survived |
    |---|---|
    | the tray's menu with one nested `Menu` | 0 of 10, then 1 of 10 |
    | the same menu with that submenu's items lifted to the top level | 10 of 10 |
    | the tray with no menu at all | 10 of 10 |
    | no tray published | 10 of 10 |

    So the Linux build publishes a tray again, and `Main.qml`'s tray menu is flat: the signal
    path is a disabled heading that reads the current choice, with the seven choices under it.
    One shape rather than one per platform, because a submenu is not worth two menus to
    maintain, and because the same Qt defect is reachable on any platform whose theme provides
    no native menu. `tst_platform.qml`'s `test_theTrayMenuNestsNoSubmenu` walks the tray's items
    and fails on a `subMenu`, so putting one back fails a test rather than a person's session.
    Verified afterwards on the VM: 20 of 20 launches survived, valgrind reports no invalid read
    or write in 180 seconds, and `GetLayout` called by hand returns all nineteen items.

    `ui/tray_support.hpp` is still the seam, one file per platform beside
    `ui/src/platform/<os>/app_icon_provider.cpp` — but both platforms now answer it with
    `QSystemTrayIcon::isSystemTrayAvailable()`, which is what a seam should look like when the
    platforms agree. Where a session has no tray at all, the sentence beside the greyed "keep
    running in the tray" setting is still the platform's own, and `onClosing` still quits rather
    than hiding a window with no way back to it.

    **No upstream report is recorded.** The report would be the two blocks above: `QDBusPlatformMenu` has
    no `createSubMenu()`, and `QDBusPlatformMenuItem::setMenu()` `static_cast`s whatever it is
    handed. Either half alone would be enough to fix it — a `createSubMenu()` that returns a new
    `QDBusPlatformMenu`, or a `qobject_cast` in `setMenu()` that refuses what it cannot use.
    Reproduced on Qt 6.8.2 on two architectures; `apps/crucible/linux/tray-vm/` builds the machine that
    shows it.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-07: the probe thread outlived what it was enumerating"

    The probe thread that the Pi run's fourth fix introduced — the one that took the enumeration
    off the frame thread after a seven-second first frame — was never joined. `loop()` ended with
    `watcher.stop(); output->stop(); taps.sync({})` and returned; `Engine::stop()` joined the
    frame thread and nothing else; `CrucibleController::stop()` reset the engine the moment that
    returned. `~Impl` destroys members in reverse declaration order, and `probe_thread` was
    declared *above* `output` and above the mutex and optional its body writes the facts into —
    so all three were destroyed before `~jthread` got as far as joining it. A quit that landed
    while an enumeration was in flight pulled the `OutputStage` out from under the thread
    running `output->enumerate()` on it.

    Found by reading the shutdown path, not by a crash: nothing here has observed it, and the
    window it needs is however long one enumeration takes. That window is widest exactly where
    Phase 5 says to be careful — `enumerate()` on macOS is a round trip to coreaudiod, and this
    plan has already met one Core Audio call on an engine thread that did not come back.

    `loop()` now joins the probe before it stops the watcher or the output, so the enumeration
    finishes while the engine is still whole, and that join is the guarantee. `probe_thread` also
    moves below `output` in the struct so `~jthread` would run before any of them if the join
    were ever lost; the comment there says which of the two is the guarantee and which is the
    backstop. The join is a plain one, because the probe's body never reads its stop token and
    `request_stop()` would shorten nothing — so quitting now waits out a whole `enumerate()`.
    That is a second reason for that call to be bounded, and it has no overall bound today: the
    PipeWire path answers in seconds per device, and what the macOS path does when Core Audio
    does not answer is one of the things no Mac here has run.

### Phase 5: macOS

Both halves of this phase are on the branch. The library half is an Objective-C++ translation
unit — `CATapDescription` has no C entry point — implementing the tap with
`muteBehavior = CATapMutedWhenTapped`, plus a `DeviceWatcher` over three property listeners on the
system object: `kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices` for the device list, and
`kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice`/`…DefaultInputDevice` for the two defaults moving. The
platform half reads
`kAudioHardwarePropertyProcessObjectList`, takes the frontmost application from `NSWorkspace`, and
renders a per-application signal path because macOS has no silent device to point at. The version
floor is pinned at **14.2**, in one place — `ac3::coreaudio::kSystemAudioTapMinimumOs` — with the
14.4 figure some third-party write-ups use recorded beside it and the reason it was not taken.

**Exit:** compiles and links on both macOS CI legs and survives the universal merge. **The
compiling and linking is done; the universal merge has not run. The application itself cannot be
run by anyone here**; see below.

!!! note "Written 2026-09-06: both halves exist and compile; almost none of it has run"
    `libs/audio/src/backend/macos/process_tap.{hpp,mm}`,
    `apps/crucible/engine/src/platform/macos/` and `apps/crucible/ui/src/platform/macos/` are all
    written, and the root guard in `CMakeLists.txt` is now `WIN32 OR APPLE OR LINUX` — macOS is a
    supported platform rather than an excluded one.

    Three separate claims, and they are kept apart here because collapsing them is what went
    wrong before: this paragraph has twice described a state the branch had already left — once
    because two parallel worktrees were merged, once because CI had moved on since it was
    written:

    - **Written**, yes. Both halves, on this branch.
    - **Compiled**, yes, on both legs. The first CI attempt never reached a compiler: it stopped
      during configure, at an `install(TARGETS ac3crucible)` rule that named no
      `BUNDLE DESTINATION` for a target with `MACOSX_BUNDLE` on. With that fixed, both macOS legs
      built every source of both halves — the three `.mm` files among them — and linked
      `bin/ac3crucible.app/Contents/MacOS/ac3crucible`. The universal merge that follows needs
      both legs green, which they are again since the Qt Quick timeouts were traced and fixed
      (see [macOS](../../platforms/macos.md#ci-what-has-and-has-not-been-verified)).
    - **Run**, more of it than this note first claimed, and that is how the hang was found. The
      eleven Crucible Qt Quick suites run on both macOS legs, and eight of them drive the real
      platform seams: `Main.qml` starts the engine whenever the window is built, so the session
      monitor, the foreground, the default device, the virtual device and the output stage all
      execute there. Two library cases execute backend code besides — the version gate, and the
      device-watcher contract case, which starts and stops a watcher on the runner. What has
      still never run is a tap: it is refused before the blocking call now (see the Phase 5
      record below), and no Mac has ever taken samples through one. Nobody has launched the
      application on a desktop Mac.
    - Two lines of the macOS row in [What cannot be verified](#what-cannot-be-verified-and-why)
      were wrong and are corrected by what the runners did. CI **does** have a default output
      device: `create_process_tap()` refuses with `kNoDefaultOutputDevice` before it builds
      anything, and it did not. And the tap's consent prompt was **not** the wall — Crucible is
      unsigned and declares no `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription`, and
      `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap` returned a tap anyway. What is in the way is one step
      further on, and is written down where it was found.

    Every file under the new directories says as much at its head, so a reader who opens one of
    them first is told before they read anything else.

    The five seams, and what each is over:

    - **`SessionMonitor`** reads `kAudioHardwarePropertyProcessObjectList` and, per process
      object, `kAudioProcessPropertyPID`, `…BundleID` and `…IsRunningOutput`. Its
      `listing_rule()` is closer to Linux's than to Windows': the list follows what is using the
      sound hardware rather than what has a window. It says *both* halves — listed while macOS
      holds sound open for it, greyed while nothing is coming out — and claims nothing about how
      long a paused player lingers, because that is exactly the thing one launch would settle
      and no launch has happened. The macOS 14.0 floor is a real runtime gate
      (`__builtin_available`, the shape `system_audio_tap_api_available()` already uses), since
      the deployment target is 13.3; below it the list is empty and the rule says why rather
      than leaving an empty room unexplained. An application's identity comes from the
      *outermost* `.app` bundle its executable lies in, which is what puts a browser's audio
      helper in the room as the browser: Windows' same-image process walk finds nothing here,
      because the helper is a different binary with a different name inside the same bundle.
    - **`Foreground`** asks NSWorkspace for the frontmost application and then reports that it
      **cannot answer**, with which of two reasons applies decided by that call — there is a
      window session but macOS will not say whether anything fills the screen, or there is no
      window session at all. It deliberately does not hand back the frontmost pid: the engine
      pins whatever this returns to the bed, so answering "the window with focus" would move a
      person's mixer around as they clicked between applications and `support()` would be
      reporting availability while doing it. `foreground.hpp`'s own rule. What would answer the
      question is `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` bounds against `CGDisplayBounds`, and the file
      says so, why it was not written here (that family is being deprecated in favour of
      ScreenCaptureKit, and a deprecation warning is a failed build under `-Werror`, which would
      break the one claim this code can carry) and what to do about it with a Mac in front of
      you.
    - **`DefaultDevice`** reads `kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice` and never writes it.
      `moves_default()` is **false**, the only platform where it is, and that is the point: the
      tap mutes where it taps, so nothing has to be moved and nothing has to be restored on
      quit. `set_default()` refuses with a sentence saying it does not need to.
      `FirstRunDialog.qml` was checked before this was relied on — it already computes
      `movesDefault && silentDeviceNeeded` and renders "Applications are silenced where they are
      tapped" with "Nothing in your sound settings changes here" when that is false, hiding the
      device status, the blocker, Send and the restore row with it. No QML needed changing.
    - **`VirtualDevice`** answers `needed = false`. `how_to_get_one()` is written to read as
      "nothing to do here" rather than as a missing feature, by naming what happens instead:
      "nothing to install: macOS silences each application at the point Crucible taps it, so no
      silent device is needed". `device_name()` is **empty**, because there is no endpoint to
      name and inventing one would put a device in the room's vocabulary that is not on the
      machine; every consumer already guards an empty search before using it.
    - **`AudioDevices`** needed nothing new. That seam is the one platform service that is not
      per-platform — `engine/library_devices.cpp` forwards it to `ac3::audio`, whose macOS
      backend already answers — so a `macos/audio_devices.cpp` would have been a duplicate
      definition of `platform_audio_devices()` and a link error, not a gap.

    The window half is two files. `tray_support.cpp` answers **yes**, through Qt's own
    `isSystemTrayAvailable()` as Windows does, and the file records why Linux's no was not
    inherited: every part of the fault measured there is in Qt's D-Bus and dbusmenu path, and
    macOS puts a `QSystemTrayIcon` in the menu bar as an `NSStatusItem` with no D-Bus anywhere.
    That is a reason not to copy Linux's refusal and it is **not** evidence that this works;
    whoever runs Crucible on a Mac first should run the Linux file's own reproducer — ten
    launches, count the survivors — before trusting it, and the file says so.
    `app_icon_provider.mm` asks NSWorkspace for a bundle's icon in three rungs (the `.app` path,
    then the bundle identifier through `URLForApplicationWithBundleIdentifier:`, then the
    monogram) and follows the Linux provider's threading discipline exactly: parse on Qt Quick's
    pixmap-reader thread, hop to the GUI thread for every AppKit call with the same bounded
    2 s wait and the same shared block, cache the null as an answer, scale per request. The
    reason for the rule differs — AppKit is main-thread-only where `QIconLoader` is an unlocked
    process-wide cache — and the consequence is identical.

    Two things this needed elsewhere in the tree, both because a third platform arrived where
    the code had assumed two. `tst_about.qml` inferred "the application makes its own silent
    device" from `!silentDeviceFromPackage`, which macOS also answers while carrying no PipeWire
    section, so it now reads `silentDeviceNeeded && !silentDeviceFromPackage`.
    `tst_settings.qml` asserted `silentDeviceNeeded` outright, in a case whose own comment
    already said what macOS would do. `tst_platform.qml` gains three macOS cases beside the
    Linux and Windows ones. All three of those files have since passed on both macOS legs, which
    says that the seams say what they were written to say — nothing more, because every service
    behind them is a fake in those tests.

    Two consequences worth naming. Objective-C++ enters the tree, in **three `.mm` files across
    two directories that enable the language**: the library's own `process_tap.mm`, under
    `enable_language(OBJCXX)` in `libs/audio/CMakeLists.txt`'s APPLE block, and Crucible's
    `foreground.mm` and `app_icon_provider.mm`, under a second such call in
    `apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt`'s APPLE arm. Both call sites pin `CMAKE_OBJCXX_COMPILER` to
    the C++ compiler the toolchain file chose, and
    `cmake/toolchains/macos.llvm.toolchain.cmake` sets `CMAKE_OBJCXX_FLAGS_INIT` beside
    `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT`, so the two halves of one target cannot end up built against two
    standard libraries. And `notices/platform/macos/components.cmake` had to exist or a macOS
    configure would stop dead: the two Windows-specific sentences in the shared `qt-bundled`
    fragment are now tokens each platform supplies, and Windows' `NOTICES.txt` is byte-for-byte
    what it was.

    **The library half is done, and this is what it does.** `process_tap.mm` builds the
    `CATapDescription` and the private aggregate device carrying it; `capture.cpp`'s
    `start_process_loopback` opens an `AudioDeviceIOProcID` on that device; `device_watcher.cpp`
    is the `DeviceWatcher` over the three property listeners, and the one piece of this a CI
    runner exercises at all; and `audio_backend.cpp` reports
    `process_loopback` **available** unless the machine is older than the 14.2 floor. So the room
    no longer lists applications the build cannot capture *for want of a tap*. What it may still
    fail on, and none of which anyone here can try, is set out in
    [macOS → Per-application capture](../../platforms/macos.md#per-application-capture-the-core-audio-process-tap):
    the TCC consent prompt is keyed to a code-signing identity Crucible does not have (DR6); the
    `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` key that drives that prompt is declared by no bundle in this
    tree, `apps/crucible`'s included; and the backend refuses a sample rate its tap does not
    already deliver rather than resampling, where `TapPool` asks for 48 kHz unconditionally, so a
    machine whose output device sits at 44.1 kHz would have every tap refused.

    One narrowing is a ceiling rather than a failure waiting to happen. A `CATapDescription`
    mixes down to mono or stereo only, and anything wider is refused with `kFormatUnsupported`;
    `TapPool` opens at stereo and widens only to follow a null sink's width, which this platform
    does not have, so what the engine asks for stays inside that. The cost lands as a limit
    rather than a refusal: the eight-channel width that keeps a surround application's bed intact
    on Windows cannot be had here at all.

    **Not done when this was written.** `cmake/Packaging.cmake` gated the Crucible component on
    `WIN32 OR LINUX`, so there was no macOS package, and `cmake/StripQtTestDeployment.cmake` did
    nothing on macOS, so a `.app` would have kept its deployed Qt Test. Both were done on
    2026-09-16: the gate is `WIN32 OR LINUX OR APPLE`, the script strips Qt's test module from the
    bundle, and CI packages the archive on the macOS legs and checks it
    (`tools/ci/check_crucible_package.py`), without publishing it.
    `SettingsPage.qml`'s two-stage note is still not gated on `silentDeviceNeeded` the way the
    block below it is, and would print an empty pair of quotes where the device has no name.

    And the signal path's first station is still drawn where it should not be. `moves_default()`
    is the first seam answer to come back false, and `default_device.hpp` has said since the
    seams were extracted on 2026-09-04 that the window "drops the whole first station of the
    signal path" when it does — which turned out on 2026-09-06 to be the intention rather than
    the code. What the window
    does, read rather than assumed: `FirstRunDialog.qml` branches correctly and hides the whole
    device step; every "Send applications to …" control in `SignalPath.qml`, `OutputPage.qml`
    and the tray menu is disabled, because each gates on
    `nullSinkPresent || silentDeviceCanCreate` and both are false here; the launch-time move sits
    behind `behaviour/moveDefaultOnLaunch`, which defaults to false. But `SignalPath.qml`'s
    station 1 itself is not gated on `movesDefault`, so a Mac would show it with the warning
    "Send applications to the silent device instead" — advice that is wrong on the one platform
    that needs no silent device. The header's claim has been corrected to say what the code does;
    the QML has not been changed, because that is a layout change nobody here can run the window
    to look at.

!!! success "Compiled 2026-09-06, and the first thing running it showed"

    Both macOS legs configured, compiled and linked the whole macOS half - the Objective-C++, the
    Core Audio selectors, the tap description, the availability guards and the OBJCXX CMake - on
    code written without a Mac. That is Phase 5's exit condition and the only claim it was
    entitled to make.

    Then the Intel leg ran 1,331 tests and passed them, and the Apple Silicon leg hung. Three of
    the eleven Qt Quick suites - `firstrun`, `room` and `shell` - sat at ctest's 300-second limit
    while the other eight passed.

!!! success "Found 2026-09-06: the call that blocks, from a stack"

    A temporary CI step ran each of the three suites on its own and took a five-second `sample`
    of the stuck process on both macOS legs. Three processes, three stacks, one shape.

    **`AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID` on the process tap's aggregate device does not return.** The
    engine's frame thread is parked in `mach_msg2_trap` inside
    `HALC_ProxyIOContext::_TellServerAboutStreamUsage`, waiting on a reply from `coreaudiod`,
    reached through `Engine::Impl::refresh_sessions` → `TapPool::sync` → `Capture::start_process_loopback`.
    Everything before it succeeded: the pid translated to a process object, `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap`
    returned a tap, `AudioHardwareCreateAggregateDevice` returned the private aggregate, and
    `kAudioTapPropertyFormat` read back. The TCC consent prompt the code comments expected to be
    the wall was never the wall.

    **What the machine actually is**, since three assumptions about it turned out to be wrong.
    `macos-latest` is macOS 26.6.2 (25G83) on arm64. It has an audio device: `Apple Virtual
    Sound Device`, two output channels at 48 kHz, both default output and default system output
    - which is what the tap's aggregate names as its main sub-device and is clocked by. It has a
    window session: `launchctl managername` answers `Aqua`. And it granted the tap without a
    prompt. Whether a virtualised sound device is *why* the IOProc registration never completes
    is not established here, though it is the most obvious candidate and the first thing to try on real
    hardware.

    **The window froze because that request wedged the whole HAL client.** `CrucibleController::poll()`
    calls `refreshDefault()`, which is an ordinary `enumerate_render_devices()` on the GUI thread;
    on the first poll after `start()` it blocked in `mach_msg2_trap` too, behind the outstanding
    tap request. So Qt's event loop never returned, `tryVerify`'s own five-second timeout could
    never fire, and ctest's 300 seconds is what ended it. The same enumeration runs on the GUI
    thread in every passing suite and returns in milliseconds, which is what says it is blocked
    behind the tap rather than slow on its own.

    **Two things the earlier record got wrong, and the PASS lines say so.**

    The three are not "the three that do not install the scripted machine, each hanging on its
    first case that starts the engine". `Main.qml`'s `Component.onCompleted` calls `start()`, so
    every case that builds the window starts the engine against the real seams - and four of them
    pass in `tst_shell` before the hang, and five run in `tst_firstrun` (four passing, one
    skipping on a platform that never moves the default). What the hanging case has in each
    suite is that it leaves the engine RUNNING: `tryVerify(framesEncoded > 0, 5000)` in `room` and
    `shell`, a second shell and `wait(300)` in `firstrun`. The others start and stop it inside a
    few tens of milliseconds, before the session monitor's first list reaches the frame thread and
    a tap is attempted.

    And the two legs differ by more than their CPU. `macos-latest` is **macOS 26.6.2** and
    `macos-15-intel` is **macOS 15.7.9**; the arm64 leg hung on both runs it has had, the Intel
    leg passed all eleven and finished `room` in 10.65 s. Two variables separate them and nothing
    here can say which one matters, so neither "Apple Silicon" nor "macOS 26" is the finding. What
    is known is that one host wedged and the other did not.

!!! success "Fixed 2026-09-06: the tap is not entered until a Mac has completed it"

    `process_loopback_available()` on macOS took a version test as its whole answer, and reported
    the capability available on the strength of it. That was the thing that turned out to be
    wrong: every documented precondition was satisfied on the machine that hung. So the backend
    now carries a second gate beside the version one
    (`libs/audio/src/backend/macos/coreaudio_names.hpp`), the capability reports **not available**
    with a reason that names the hang, and `Capture::start_process_loopback()` refuses before it
    reaches the blocking call. `AC3FORGE_MACOS_PROCESS_TAP` in the environment turns the path back
    on for whoever has a Mac to settle it on.

    A refusal is what the rest of the stack was already written for. `TapPool::sync` returns the
    applications whose tap was refused and the engine notes each once; the frame loop carries on
    and encodes, the window renders, and the eleven suites run. Nothing was given the scripted
    machine to make that happen - the session monitor, the default device, the virtual device, the
    foreground and the output stage all still run for real on those legs, which is the coverage
    the three suites exist for.

    What Crucible on macOS can do today is therefore smaller than Phase 5 claimed and is stated
    rather than discovered: it lists the applications using sound, draws them in the room, and
    taps none of them. The `--label-exclude crucible-ui` in `.github/workflows/_build.yml` is
    gone with the hang it was working around.

    Worth stating plainly, because it is the whole argument for compiling a platform nobody can
    run: this was invisible until something ran it, what ran it was eight test cases on a hosted
    runner, and what identified it was one `sample` on the way past.

!!! note "2026-09-07: `Engine::start()` can now refuse, and what that does and does not fix"
    The principle the hang above argues for - a window that says it could not start beats one
    that hangs - was not something `Engine::start()` could express. It spawned the worker and
    returned `{}` unconditionally, while everything that can fail (the output stage, the first
    enumeration, opening a sink) happened on that thread afterwards. So `CrucibleController`
    set `running = true` and left `lastError` empty on a machine with no audio endpoint at all,
    the status strip had nothing to print, and the "the engine did not start here" skip in
    `tst_room.qml` and the `running || lastError.length > 0` disjunction in `tst_shell.qml`
    were both dead branches: the left side was always true.

    `start()` now waits for the worker to say what happened, under two deadlines that mean
    different things and are set out in `engine.cpp` beside the constants. The build half - the
    output stage, the encoder, the session monitor's thread, none of which touches a device -
    has to report inside `kBuildDeadline`, and not reporting is a refusal. The first probe's
    verdict has `kProbeDeadline`, and *not* answering in time is not a refusal: PipeWire spends
    two seconds per endpoint, so the machines slow to answer are the ones that have endpoints
    to answer with, and refusing them would be a false refusal on every working Linux desktop.
    A working start costs a frame; the worst a healthy machine pays is `kProbeDeadline`.

    A refusal reports; it does not stop the frame loop. Both callers - the window and
    `ac3crucible-run` - discard an engine whose `start()` refused, so leaving would never be
    needed, and it would be actively wrong on the one path where the probe's verdict lands
    after `kProbeDeadline` has passed: a loop that left there would be a machine that never
    notices the endpoint appearing, or the default being moved off the one endpoint that was
    blocking it.

    What this does not do is rescue the hang above. A worker wedged inside a platform call
    still has to be joined by `stop()`, so that refusal is a hang deferred rather than one
    avoided, and abandoning the thread instead needs the Mac this phase does not have. What it
    does buy is every refusal that reports rather than wedges - no usable endpoint, a sink that
    will not open - which is the case the window and the QML suites were written for and could
    not reach. `apps/crucible/engine/tests/test_engine_start.cpp` holds all of it over the fakes (which is
    why `engine.cpp` now compiles into `ac3tests`), and `TestServices.scriptMachineWithNoOutput()`
    lets a QML suite script the refusal rather than wait for a seat that happens to have no
    sound card.

    Writing those cases found a second thing, which is the usual argument for writing them: an
    `Engine` stopped and started again never enumerated. `want_reprobe` was set once at
    construction and cleared by the first frame, so the second run built a fresh `OutputStage`
    and then never asked it anything, and sat in "none" whatever the machine had. Nothing
    shipped takes that path - the window builds a new engine on every restart - so it had never
    shown up. Each run now asks for its own first probe.

### Phase 6: product qualities

First-run explanation of what the application is about to do to the sound settings; a log export
that carries no key material; a review pass over the six mechanically translated languages;
third-party licence notices per platform; and an accessibility pass over a UI that has only ever
been driven with a mouse.

Settings migration is done early, in Phase 1, because the rename moves the store: the demo kept
its settings under `ac3forge/DesktopAtmos` and the product keeps them under `ac3forge/Crucible`,
so without a copy on first run a machine that ran the demo would silently lose its signing-key
path, endpoint choice and appearance.

One licence notice is already wrong and is corrected with them: the About box credits the driver
to Microsoft's Simple Audio Sample, which was true of the PortCls miniport but not of the ACX
driver that replaced it on 2026-09-04. The driver's own README and version resource say
AudioCodec ACX sample; the window is the one place that still says otherwise.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-05: first-run explanation and restore-on-quit"
    `FirstRunDialog.qml` opens once over a fresh settings store, one event-loop turn after
    `Main.qml`'s `Component.onCompleted`, and says what Crucible does to the sound settings
    before it does it. Every sentence that names the silent device or how this platform gets
    one comes from the controller's seams (`nullSinkName`, `silentDeviceAdvice`,
    `silentDeviceBlocker`, `silentDeviceFromPackage`, `silentDeviceNeeded` and a new
    `movesDefault` over `DefaultDevice::moves_default()`), so the QML carries no platform word
    and the same file says the macOS-shaped thing (nothing in the sound settings changes) where
    the default never moves. Three ways out - Send applications, Not now, Open Settings - and a
    tick that is `behaviour/moveDefaultOnLaunch`; every way out, Escape included, writes
    `firstRun/acknowledgedVersion`, an int against `kFirstRunVersion`, so the endpoint rename
    after driver signing can show it once more. On the one launch it has not been seen, the
    launch-time automatic move waits behind the dialog; a profile migrated from the demo (now
    marked `migration/fromDesktopAtmos` by `migrate_demo_settings()`) sees it once too, with a
    sentence saying the settings were carried over. `--shot` runs suppress it;
    `--page firstrun` captures it.

    Two corrections rode along. The restore on quit that `SettingsPage`, `SignalPath`,
    `install.md`, `signal-path.md` and this page's own Phase 1 record promised was implemented
    only in the console runner: `CrucibleController::quit()` (tray Quit, and the window's close
    with keep-running off) now restores the previous default when Crucible itself moved it
    (`moved_default_by_us_`), `QCoreApplication::aboutToQuit` runs the same idempotent restore,
    and `stop()` still never touches the default, so the QML suites' `stop()` calls cannot move
    a developer's output. And on Linux `moveDefaultToNullSink()` creates the node first where
    the application makes the silent device itself, so the seam's "Crucible creates it when you
    send applications to it" is what happens and the three Send buttons are enabled while
    `silentDeviceCanCreate`. Tests: `tst_firstrun.qml` (nine cases, none presses Send),
    additions to `tst_settings.qml`, `tst_shell.qml` and `test_platform_seams.cpp`. Not done then:
    the six `.ts` files needed the central lupdate pass for the FirstRunDialog context (done on
    2026-09-06: [Languages](../localisation.md)), and the Linux create-on-send wait needs a Pi run
    to confirm the node is found within its bounded 500 ms.
!!! success "Done 2026-09-05"
    The log export. A Qt-free module, `apps/crucible/engine/diagnostics.{hpp,cpp}`, holds a
    thread-safe ring of the last 512 one-line notes and a renderer over named fields. The
    engine, the controller and a Qt message handler in `ui/main.cpp` write to one process-wide
    ring: engine start and stop with their counters, the signing outcome as a sentence that
    names no file, the device watcher's refusal, each output change with its reason, tap
    refusals once per application, encode refusals on the transition, catch-ups every
    hundredth, setting changes, default-output moves and silent-device actions. Settings
    block 07 saves the report as `crucible-diagnostics-<date>-<time>.txt` through a save
    dialog; the file carries the version and platform (with the audio backend's capabilities
    and whether the full-screen rule can work), the signing facts, the engine's counters
    including the catch-ups, tap backlog and sink queue the window never showed, the
    endpoints, the applications by name and description, the two devices of the signal path,
    a whitelisted settings list and the recent messages.

    Redaction is structural first: `EngineStatus::signing` (which names the key file for the
    Settings page) and `AppStatus::image_path` are never read, the settings are a fixed list
    with anything under `signing/` written as withheld, and the environment is never
    enumerated. Then the finished text is scrubbed of every spelling of the key path and of
    the inline `AC3FORGE_SIGNING_KEY` value, for lines that arrived through the message ring.
    `apps/crucible/engine/tests/test_diagnostics.cpp` holds the rule over the renderer on every CI leg and
    `tst_settings.qml` holds it over the window with a chosen key file; `tst_shell.qml` checks
    the engine's own notes reach the report and the status line that names the file never
    does. `SigningHook` gained `source_kind()` and `failure()` so the engine can say how the
    key was obtained without saying where it is. Not captured, and the troubleshooting page
    says so: PipeWire's own stderr output and the decoder's AP11 events.
!!! success "Done 2026-09-05: third-party licence notices per platform"
    Every Crucible package now carries a `NOTICES.txt` written for it, and the About box's
    Licences… button shows the same text. The file is generated at configure time by
    `cmake/Notices.cmake` from `notices/`: shared fragments, a component list per
    platform directory (`platform/windows/`, `platform/linux/` - the same selection rule as
    `engine/src/platform/`, so no fragment, QML or C++ file names an operating system), verbatim
    licence texts under `licences/`, and the versions CMake already holds (`Qt6_VERSION`, the
    `{fmt}` and PipeWire versions, `PROJECT_VERSION_FULL`). The Qt Quick 3D and Tracy sections
    are inserted by the same build facts that gate `Room3DView.qml` and `ac3::tracy`. A missing
    fragment, a missing licence file or an unreplaced `{{TOKEN}}` fails configure by name.

    The Windows zip carries `NOTICES.txt` and `LICENSE.txt` at its root: the bundled Qt modules,
    the LGPL-3 text with the relinking statement and the download.qt.io source location for the
    exact version, the third-party code inside the Qt libraries transcribed from the 6.8.3 kit's
    SPDX documents, the five runtime files windeployqt places (Mesa llvmpipe under the MIT, the
    DirectX Shader Compiler under the NCSA licence, three Microsoft redistributables under their
    own terms), `{fmt}`, the OFL 1.1 with the Archivo and Noto copyright lines, and the
    Ac3ForgeNullSink driver's MS-PL for the three scripts the package carries. The Linux tarball
    and `.deb` carry theirs under `share/doc/ac3forge-crucible/` with `LICENSE.txt` and once more
    as `copyright`, the name Debian tools look for: built against the system Qt, linking
    libpipewire-0.3, `{fmt}`, the fonts. The same file is embedded as `:/notices/NOTICES.txt` and
    read by `CrucibleController.licenceNotices`, so the dialog cannot say something the package
    does not; `--page licences` captures it.

    One finding to keep: the kit's SBOM concludes Qt Quick 3D, Quick3DRuntimeRender and
    Quick3DUtils as "Commercial OR GPL-3.0-only", where every other module is also offered under
    the LGPL-3. The About box had said LGPL for all of Qt. A GPL-3.0-or-later application
    satisfies that, and the notices say so, but a Windows build with the 3D room is a GPL-3
    combined work; any later plan to offer Crucible under other terms, or through a store that
    refuses the GPL, would have to drop or replace the 3D view. The driver credit is corrected
    with the rest: the notices and the About box say AudioCodec ACX sample, and
    `apps/crucible/windows/driver/README.md` records that the three scripts travel into the package under
    that directory's terms.

    `tools/ci/check_crucible_package.py` reads the notices as well as the archive's names: each
    platform's required and forbidden phrases, a filled Qt version, and on Windows the Qt Quick
    3D section present exactly when `qml/QtQuick3D/` shipped; `tools/ci/test_check_crucible_package.py`
    pins those rules, and `tst_about.qml` holds the embedded text to `silentDeviceFromPackage`
    and `has3D` and opens the dialog from About. Not done then: the Windows zip still carried
    Qt6Test, Qt6QuickTest and `qml/QtTest`, which the deploy picked up from the test QML. Since
    then `cmake/StripQtTestDeployment.cmake` deletes them at install time, and
    `tools/ci/check_crucible_package.py` fails if they return.

!!! success "Measured 2026-09-05: what the tests reach"

    The first coverage figures since the rename, from
    `tools/checks/coverage_crucible.ps1` over a `config-windows-llvm-coverage` build running the
    `crucible` and `crucible-ui` labels - 99 cases between them. Over `apps/crucible`:
    **76.3% of lines** (1,036 of 4,369 missed), **62.2% of branches** and 84.2% of functions.
    The demo's last measurement, under its old name, was 72% of lines and 60% of branches from
    57 cases, so the figure held while the code grew by half.

    The shape matters more than the total. What this pass added is among the best covered:
    `engine/diagnostics.cpp` 91% of lines, `ui/desktop_entries.cpp` 94%, `engine/slots.cpp` 96%,
    `engine/tap_pool.cpp` 97%. What is thin is thin for reasons that are on this page already:
    `ui/main.cpp` is 0%, because the Qt Quick harness has an entry point of its own and never
    runs the application's; `engine/src/platform/windows/driver_tools.cpp` is 30%, because the rest
    of it launches an elevated PowerShell script that no test may run; and
    `platform/windows/{default_device,foreground}.cpp` sit near 46%, because their other half
    is what a machine with a real endpoint and a real front window does.

!!! success "Measured 2026-09-06: the same suite on a runner, and why it reads eight points lower"

    The first CI run of the coverage gate read **68.5% of lines** (1,401 of 4,442 missed) and
    **55.1% of branches** over the same two labels on the windows-llvm leg. The eight points
    between that and the day before are not drift, and they are worth knowing before anyone
    tries to explain a future dip: they are the Windows platform seams, which cover far more on
    a machine with a real audio environment than on a headless runner.

    | file | workstation | runner |
    |---|---|---|
    | `platform/windows/session_monitor.cpp` | 85.0% | 34.0% |
    | `platform/windows/default_device.cpp` | 45.8% | 24.7% |
    | `engine/library_devices.cpp` | 64.3% | 11.9% |

    Those three enumerate endpoints, walk audio sessions and ask the shell about windows. A
    runner with no sound device and no desktop takes the early return in each, so the code below
    it never runs. Both readings are defensible; the runner's is the one a gate has to hold on, so
    the floor is calibrated from it and the workstation figure is kept here as the ceiling the
    same suite reaches when the machine can answer.

    The Linux platform half barely appears here, and it is worth being exact about why. The
    Catch2 binary links `apps/crucible/engine/tests/platform_services_stub.cpp`, which supplies every
    `platform_*()` factory, so no platform seam is compiled into it on any operating system.
    What it does take out of `engine/src/platform/linux/` is the part of that directory needing
    neither xcb nor PipeWire: `x11_foreground.cpp`, the X11 Foreground's policy over an
    injected reader, and - since the seams pass below - `proc_facts.hpp`, the session monitor's
    /proc readers, its per-process fact cache and the two records a refresh builds, moved into
    a header so they could be reached at all. Everything else - the rest of the Linux session
    monitor, the default device and the silent device - is reached only through the Qt Quick
    suites, which run the real controller against the real seams. Those numbers therefore exist
    only where a Qt build runs `crucible-ui`: this Windows machine, the Raspberry Pi and the
    Linux CI leg. Measuring the Linux side means a coverage build on one of the latter two, and
    the machine-facing parts of those files stay outside any of it -
    `tools/checks/crucible_platform_probe.cpp` is what exercises them, by hand, on hardware.

    A floor is set from this measurement, and the script that reads it now fails when the
    number drops. `tools/checks/coverage_crucible.ps1` gates `apps/crucible` at **74% of
    lines and 60% of branches** - about two points under what was read here, so it holds
    today's state rather than asking for tests nobody has written - and prints the per-file
    breakdown under the gate, reported and not gated, so a file at 0% shows as itself rather
    than averaging away. A failing `ctest` fails the script too, which it did not before: a
    coverage figure for a suite that had gone red was worth nothing. The floors and their
    calibration live in that script's own header the way `coverage_report.sh` carries the
    library's, with the same instruction attached - raise them as the suite grows rather than
    leaving the headroom in place.

    It runs on the Windows clang-cl leg (`.github/workflows/_build.yml`, "Crucible coverage
    floor"): a second instrumented tree inside a leg that already has clang-cl, the pinned
    LLVM and the Qt kit, rather than a job of its own, because on this fleet a queue slot
    costs more than a core. The Linux figure is still not taken anywhere, for the reason
    above - it needs a coverage build on the Pi or on the Linux CI leg.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-06: the seams nothing tested"

    An audit found three places under `apps/crucible` with no test at all, and all three are
    seams - the parts of this application that differ per platform and therefore have the
    fewest readers.

    **The tray.** `ui/src/platform/{windows,linux}/tray_support.cpp` are now driven by
    `ui/tests/qml/tst_platform.qml`, on both platforms, through the same
    `CrucibleController.trayAvailable`/`trayAbsentReason` the window binds. The invariant it
    holds everywhere is that a tray which is not published carries a sentence a person can
    read and one that is published carries none, and on each platform the seam is checked
    against `Qt.labs.platform.SystemTrayIcon.available` - the question both of them now defer
    to. The Linux file answered a flat no for a day, and the test with it; what is left of
    that is `test_theTrayMenuNestsNoSubmenu`, which walks the tray's own items and fails on a
    `subMenu`, because the crash was a Qt type confusion reached only through a nested one
    (Phase 4, "The tray, and the Qt bug that took it away for a day").

    **The Linux session monitor.** Its bookkeeping was unreachable rather than untested:
    `engine/src/platform/linux/session_monitor.cpp` includes `pipewire_support.hpp`, so nothing in
    it compiles without the PipeWire headers, and the /proc readers, the per-process fact
    cache and the record-building sat in an anonymous namespace inside it. They are now
    `engine/src/platform/linux/proc_facts.hpp` - the same split `process_tree.hpp` already was -
    and `apps/crucible/engine/tests/platform/linux/test_session_facts.cpp` drives them on any Linux
    machine against a `/proc` the test writes itself: a `comm` holding a space, a `stat` line
    whose comm holds a `)`, a pid with no `exe` link across a sandbox boundary. What it pins:
    the stat parse starting from the LAST `)`, /proc being read once per process and not once
    per stream, a second stream back-filling an icon the first did not carry and never
    overwriting one it did, the eviction of facts for processes that have gone, and the two
    records - the sounding one and the kept one - including the ancestor list the full-screen
    rule matches against.

    **The Linux silent device.** `engine/src/platform/linux/virtual_device.cpp` cannot be reached
    from the Catch2 binary at all (the stub is linked there, and it needs libpipewire), so
    what is testable without creating a real node is asserted through the window in the same
    `tst_platform.qml`: the device is named by the platform that owns it ("Crucible (silent)",
    not the Windows name the first Linux screenshot showed), its advice mentions no driver
    because Linux needs none, it reports itself as not from a package, it can create one, and
    nothing is ever left running after a read. The listing rule rides along, for the same
    reason - it is the sentence the room shows and the two platforms disagree about it.

    Not done, and only reachable with a daemon: `refresh()` itself, `install()`/`remove()` and
    the node teardown order, and `node_in_graph()`. Those stay with
    `tools/checks/crucible_platform_probe.cpp` on hardware.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-05: the accessibility pass"
    The window can be operated without a mouse, and what it offers a screen reader is asserted
    rather than assumed. Every hand-drawn control is a tab stop that Space and Return press
    (`CrucibleButton`, `CrucibleCheck`, `BedChip`, the header pill, the Advanced disclosure);
    the shared `SegmentedControl` is one tab stop with Left/Right/Home/End choosing inside it,
    the way a radio group behaves elsewhere. A new `ui/assets/qml/RoomKeys.qml`, a `FocusScope` around
    both room views, moves whichever application is selected: arrows across and front to back

    place one that is in the bed, Delete to return it, plus and minus for size — the same keys
    whichever picture is on screen, because nothing in it asks which. `Ctrl+1/2/3` switch pages,
    F1 opens About, Escape closes a dialog. A new shared `apps/shared/theme/assets/qml/FocusRing.qml` draws a
    two-pixel accent-derived ring outside a control's own border while it has the keyboard;
    clicking a button does not take focus, so a mouse user sees no rings, and clicking a row, a
    marker or a chip does, because that is where the arrows continue from.

    Names: markers, application rows, bed chips, endpoint rows and both buttons on each of them,
    the signal path's three stations, the two combo boxes and the pin, the driver-folder and
    silent-device fields, the applications list and the room scope all carry a role, a name and a
    description composed from the same live property the view draws — never a second, typed copy.
    Position words moved into a `RoomWords` singleton the card, the rows, the markers and the
    announcements share. An `A11y` singleton and one transition hook in `Main.qml` turn engine
    state, the hearing line, the signing status, the default output and driver messages into one
    sentence each, compared with the last one said for that fact so a 60 ms poll repeats nothing,
    and send it both to `Accessible.announce` and, through a new `CrucibleController::note`, into
    the diagnostics ring, so a report carries what the window said as well as what the engine did.

    Contrast and text size: `Theme` gained `luminance`/`contrast` (compositing the foreground's
    alpha over the background, which is what a reader sees — measuring the unmixed token reports
    about 15:1 for a colour that reads at 5), `accentInk`, focus-ring tokens, `textMuted` at 68%
    and `divider` at 50%, and `accentText` is now whichever end of the palette reads better on
    the accent. Every literal `font.pixelSize` under `apps/crucible/ui/assets/qml` is a `Theme` token
    times a new `Theme.fontScale`, and the header, footer, buttons, chips, fields and combo boxes
    derive their heights from their labels; the exceptions are the three Texts inside the 3D
    scene graph, which are scene units and say so. A Text size setting (100/125/150/175/System,
    `appearance/textScale`) drives the scale. **100% is the default.** "System" reads the point
    size the platform theme reports and counts 9 pt as 100%, which is the base size on Windows
    and what its own Text size setting scales; GNOME, KDE and Ubuntu report 10 or 11 pt with
    nothing about text size touched, so System starts the window 11 to 22% larger there. Making
    it the default would have changed the layout on the platform this window was verified on,
    silently — so it is a choice a person makes, the setting's note says what it reads, and the
    default draws the window at the size the mockups and the `--shot` captures pin.

    **One number does not reach AA, and it is a design decision on the record.** The label on a
    primary button's accent fill is the better of the two ends of the palette on that accent:
    5.7-8.6:1 in the dark modes and in ink light, but 3.95:1 in signal light and 4.22:1 in
    console light, above the 3:1 floor for a control and below the 4.5:1 one for small text. The
    fill stays the design system's colour; the alternative, filling the button with `accentInk`
    and keeping the pale label, reaches 4.5:1 and darkens the button instead. `tst_accessibility`
    asserts ">= 3, and the better of the two", `docs/crucible/accessibility.md` states both
    numbers plainly, and `apps/forge/gui` inherits whichever way this goes, so the design owner's
    answer belongs here before it merges.

    Qt floor raised to 6.8 (`Accessible.announce` is `Q_REVISION(6, 8)`) in all four
    `find_package` calls, `qt_standard_project_setup`, the tests' `find_package`, `install.md`
    and the CI warning; every verified platform is already above it (6.8 on the Pi, 6.10 on
    Windows and the fleet). The harness gained a scripted machine: a `TestServices` singleton
    over the engine's existing fakes and a plain C++ `set_test_services` on the controller,
    reachable from neither QML nor the shipped binary, so the keys-only room flow runs where
    there is no audio session. A null seam restores the platform's own and `TestServices.clear()`
    hands the machine back, which both suites do in `cleanup()`: the default device and the
    silent device are held by the controller rather than passed to the engine, and `movesDefault`
    and `silentDeviceFromPackage` are CONSTANT properties that never re-read after a swap.

    Two suites carry it: `tst_keyboard.qml` (the keys-only flows, the tab order, the focus ring,
    the text scale) and `tst_accessibility.qml` (names, roles and descriptions from live data,
    the announcer, and the palette contrast floors for signal, ink and console in both modes).
    One trap is worth keeping: a `ListView` writes its own `currentIndex` back to 0 whenever the
    value of its model changes, and the controller replaces the applications list on every poll
    where the membership or the sound-first order moved. With the row leading the selection, an
    application starting, exiting or going quiet handed the room's arrow keys to whatever had
    floated to the top of the rail. The selection leads now, and the row follows it.

    **Verified:** by the two suites, which CI runs on the Windows legs and the Linux LLVM leg
    (`ctest -L crucible-ui`, offscreen and `QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software`). **Not verified:** no
    screen reader has been run against the window by hand — neither NVDA on Windows nor Orca on
    the Pi — so the suites prove the window offers the right names, roles and announcements and
    not that a reader speaks them as intended; and no `--shot` capture has been taken at 150% to
    confirm nothing clips at the largest text size (the default draws the window unchanged).
    **Left for later:** the six `.ts` catalogues do not carry this pass's new strings and land
    with the translation review; the 3D camera's orbit and zoom and moving one side of a split
    pair on its own stay mouse-only, and `accessibility.md` says so; and the Signal path page
    still names a platform in three sentences a reader now hears out loud ("the Windows default
    output", "Headphones (Windows Spatial Sound)", "System follows Windows"), which wants the
    same controller-property treatment `fullscreenRuleReason` and `silentDeviceAdvice` already
    have. Since then the catalogues carry the strings and the three sentences no longer name
    Windows; the camera and the split pair's sides are still mouse-only.

!!! note "Still open in Phase 6"
    One of the five items is not done. The **review of the six mechanically translated
    languages** is a pass of its own. When this note was written the catalogues were stale
    against the source, with fifteen current strings missing and sixty-five rename-era entries
    left as vanished; they were regenerated and filled on 2026-09-06 (385 messages each, none
    unfinished), so what remains is the review by a reader of each language, not extraction.

    The right-to-left half of that item is done, and this note said otherwise until 2026-09-06:
    `ui/assets/qml/Main.qml` took a `LayoutMirroring` root on 2026-09-05, two cases in
    `ui/tests/qml/tst_shell.qml` hold it - the header title crosses the window under Arabic, the
    plan's L speaker does not under Hebrew - and [Languages](../localisation.md) is the record for
    what mirrors and what deliberately does not.

    No screen reader has been run against this window by anyone. The suites assert that every
    role, name and description exists and follows the live data; whether NVDA or Orca speaks
    them in a sensible order is a thing a person has to sit down and listen to.

    Three things wait on a machine rather than on work here: the Linux create-on-send wait needs
    a Pi run to confirm the node appears inside it, the application icons need the Pi to say
    which rung each application hits, and no screen reader has been run against the window on
    any platform.

### Phase 7: docs

`docs/crucible/`, taking the application out of Platform notes: an index, install and first run
per platform, the room, the output modes, the signal path, the signing key, the silent device
per platform, localisation, and troubleshooting. `windows-demo.md` stays as the historical
design and phase record, retitled and cross-linked rather than deleted, the way this project
keeps its records. `mkdocs.yml` gains a "Crucible guide" section beside "CLI reference" and
"GUI guide"; the three desktop platform pages link into it instead of owning it.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-05, first cut"
    `docs/crucible/` is a guide now, not a plan: [What it is](../index.md),
    [Install and first run](../install.md), [The signal path](../signal-path.md) and
    [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md), with this page kept beside them as the record. The nav
    carries all five under "Crucible guide", and the demo page's entry under Platform notes is
    relabelled as the record it is. `windows.md` links to the guide instead of the demo page, and
    `linux.md` gained the one thing a Linux reader has to know before anything else — that
    Crucible cannot use the backend that page otherwise recommends.

    Every claim in the guide is one this work verified or one the demo's record verified; the
    platform table on the index says "not yet confirmed" where that is the truth, and the Linux
    build command in the install page was run before it was written down. Left unwritten at the
    time: the room, output modes and settings pages the GUI guide's shape would want — those
    describe the window, and the window then existed on one platform.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-06: the room and the settings pages"
    The window runs on two platforms now and its Linux half has been read off a receiver, so the
    two pages were written from the source rather than from this plan: [The room](../room.md) and
    [Settings](../settings.md). There is no output-modes page and there will not be one —
    [The signal path](../signal-path.md) already carries the mode table, the no-key refusal and the
    pin and endpoint controls, and a second page over the same ground would be one more thing to
    keep true. Where the two platforms differ the pages say which is which, and where something
    is Windows-only today they say that too.

### Phase 8: CI and packaging

Build, test and package on three platforms: the existing Windows legs, the Linux GCC and LLVM
legs with a Qt kit, and the two macOS legs feeding the universal merge. The package check
generalises to all three layouts. Installer work is per platform — NSIS exists, `.dmg` exists,
Linux gets AppImage and `.deb` alongside the GUI's.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-05, for Linux"
    One extra pass inside the "Linux LLVM (clang)" leg builds the Linux platform half against
    PipeWire and asserts the runner binary exists — the same "extra pass, not a matrix entry"
    shape the ALSA fallback step uses. That leg and not a GCC one, because the GCC legs carry
    `alsa_fallback`, whose assertion (disabling ALSA falls back to posix) is only true while no
    PipeWire headers are installed, and this pass installs them.

    It deliberately runs no tests, and the reason is worth keeping. The `crucible` ctest label
    drives the engine over the fakes and links the platform-services *stub*, not the Linux half
    this pass exists to build, and every other Linux leg runs it already. An earlier draft ran
    that label without building `ac3tests`; `catch_discover_tests` registers cases at build
    time, so nothing matched, and `ctest` exits 0 when nothing matches. **It passed without
    running a single case.** What replaced it is an assertion on the binary, checked both ways:
    against a real build, and against the binary moved aside.

    Not done then: Windows packaging is unchanged (the driver is still test-signed, so the
    archive stays separate). The Linux package followed later the same day (the CI paragraph of
    the Phase 4 record), and macOS has had a CI archive since 2026-09-16.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-06: the same pass on aarch64"
    That pass, and the packaging the DR9 record above added to it, ran on x86_64 alone — and
    aarch64 is the only hardware the Linux half is on record as having run on. The Pi 4B run in
    Phase 4 built the window, passed all five Qt Quick suites and produced the aarch64 tarball
    and the arm64 `.deb` by hand. So the architecture the whole record rests on was the one
    nothing checked, and an aarch64-only compilation fault would have reached a user through
    the `.deb` before anyone saw it.

    The "Linux LLVM (arm64)" leg now carries `crucible: true`, and that flag is the whole of
    the change. The pass is written against `matrix.preset`, so it runs there unchanged: the
    same apt list, the same configure assertions on the backend, the X11 check and Qt SVG, the
    same engine and PipeWire-contract tags, the same headless Qt Quick suite, the same `cpack`
    and the same `check_crucible_package.py`, uploaded as
    `packages-crucible-linux-llvm-arm64` beside the x86_64 pair. That leg and not "Linux GCC
    (arm64)", which carries two flags this pass cannot sit beside: `alsa_fallback`, whose
    assertion that disabling ALSA falls back to posix holds only while no PipeWire headers are
    installed, and `release_package`, which on a `do_package` run would send the Windows-shaped
    "was the Crucible packaged" assertion looking on Linux for a `.zip` no Linux leg produces.

    One step is new, and it is there because the pass has a soft path: its Qt guard warns and
    exits 0 when the Qt it found is below the 6.8 the window needs. A leg that took that path
    would be green having built no window, run no Qt Quick suite and packaged nothing — which
    on the one leg that exists to check aarch64 leaves nothing checked at all. The step fails
    on that instead, and then reads the architecture off the files rather than off their names:
    `file` on `ac3crucible`, and the `.deb`'s own `Architecture:` field. Every name the pass
    globs for is computed from `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR`, so a package built for another target
    would match them all.

    Not done then: the leg had not run with the flag on, so this was what CI was wired to do
    rather than something a green run had shown. It has run since: CI runs uploaded
    `packages-crucible-linux-llvm-arm64` on 2026-09-29.

### Phase 9: verification

The hardware matrix, and the roadmap edits that follow from it: DR9's Windows and PipeWire rows,
UX7's macOS row, and the warning in `platforms/windows.md`.

## What cannot be verified, and why

Stating this before the work rather than after it, because three of these will still be true
when the code is finished, and a plan that implies otherwise is worth less than one that does
not.

| Claim | Can it be verified | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Linux per-application tap and null sink | **confirmed 2026-09-05** on the Pi | none |
| Linux bitstream to a receiver over ALSA | **already confirmed**, 2026-08-20 | none |
| Linux bitstream over PipeWire `iec958` | **confirmed 2026-09-05** - the receiver read "5.1 DD+", and "Atmos/DD+" at 7.1 with objects | none |
| Windows bitstream to a real receiver | not yet | an HDMI cable; DR9 |
| Windows driver on a normal machine | not yet | EV certificate and attestation; a separate session |
| macOS platform halves, at runtime | **partly, on CI since 2026-09-06** | the Crucible Qt Quick suites drive the session monitor, foreground, default device, virtual device, tray seam, icon provider, device watcher and output stage on both legs; nobody has launched the application, and no Mac has taken a sample through a tap; DR9 |
| macOS process tap end to end | **no, and now for a measured reason** | the tap, its aggregate device and its format all come back on a runner; `AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID` on that aggregate does not return, so the path is refused by default (Phase 5 record) |
| macOS tap consent prompt | **untested, and not what blocks** | it never fired: an unsigned binary declaring no `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` got a tap anyway. Still keyed to a signing identity these binaries lack; DR6 |
| Wayland full-screen foreground detection | **no**, by design | Wayland does not let a client ask about another's windows |
| X11 full-screen foreground detection | **not yet run**: tested over a fake reader only; an X11 session or a nested Xephyr on the Pi would settle it | none |
| Linux application icons, per application | yes, on a desktop with applications playing | needs the Pi; which rung each hits is machine-dependent |

Compiling on a second platform pays for itself before any of it runs. Phase 3 was written on
Windows and built clean there; the first Linux build then rejected it three times, and each was
a real defect rather than a dialect quarrel: a local that shadowed a member after a refactor
(`-Wshadow`), a partial designated initialiser MSVC accepts and GCC does not
(`-Wmissing-field-initializers`), and a capability that claimed to be available on machines
where it could not be. Only the third would have reached a user, and none of the three was
visible from the platform the code was written on.

The macOS row is the one to hold in mind while reading Phase 5. The code can be written and
compiled on CI, and its device-free logic can be unit tested, and none of that establishes that
it works. The demo page's discipline applies: what is claimed is what was checked.

**Both halves of Phase 5 were written on 2026-09-06, and the same day something ran them.** The
library gained the Core Audio process tap (`libs/audio/src/backend/macos/process_tap.{hpp,mm}`);
there is a `macos` directory under both `apps/crucible/engine/src/platform/` and
`apps/crucible/ui/src/platform/`; and macOS is a supported platform in the root `CMakeLists.txt`
rather than an excluded one. Both legs compile and link all of it, after a first attempt that
stopped during configure at an install rule.

Then the Qt Quick suites drove the platform halves for real, and the tap hung the process. That
is recorded in full in Phase 5 below. What matters for this table is that three of its long-held
assumptions about what a hosted runner is were **wrong**, and the runner said so when it was
finally asked:

- It has an audio device — `Apple Virtual Sound Device`, two channels at 48 kHz, default output
  and default system output.
- It has a window session — `launchctl managername` answers `Aqua`.
- The consent prompt did not stand in the way; the tap came back to an unsigned binary.

So "CI has no audio device, no desktop session and no way to grant the tap's consent prompt" was
three guesses in a row, each of them load-bearing for a decision, and none of them checked until
a stack forced the question. The caution the paragraph above states is unchanged and is the
reason this went the way it did: compiling on a second platform finds defects, and finding none
is not evidence that anything works. Every file in the new directories opens by saying what has
run there and what has not.

## Coordination with the driver-signing session

Driver signing was worked in a separate session against `apps/crucible/windows/driver/`, and the driver is
still test-signed with its old device name. Two consequences for this plan, and neither is
optional:

**The driver subtree's naming is not renamed in Phase 1.** The application rename stops at the
driver's door. `apps/crucible/windows/driver/` keeps its paths, its INF and its
`Ac3ForgeNullSink` identity so that work in flight does not collide with a rename underneath it.

**The device name should change before attestation is paid for, not after.** The endpoint
currently advertises "Speakers (Desktop Atmos)". That is the trademark exposure, and it lives
inside the package that gets attestation-signed — so changing it afterwards means submitting
and paying again. The right order is: the signing session lands its work, then a single
coordinated change renames the INF's device name to "Crucible" and rebuilds, then attestation is
submitted once. This plan does not make that change unilaterally; it flags it as the thing to
sequence.

!!! success "Done 2026-10-01 (change N1D)"
    Both points were taken in one change, before the driver was ever signed. The driver is
    `IclForgeNullSink` (the hardware id, the service and the file names), and its device
    description and endpoint are "Crucible Silent Output" and "Speakers (Crucible Silent Output)".
    The plan said "Crucible". The Output page's first station shows the endpoint's name beside the
    application's own station, "2 · CRUCIBLE", so the bare word would have named two stations
    alike; the longer name is one constant in the application (`kWindowsSilentDeviceName`) and one
    string in the INF. The driver had been installed only in the project's test guest, which is
    why its identity could change together with its strings. [The driver's
    page](../../platforms/windows-driver-acx.md#the-rename-2026-10-01) says what was verified in
    the guest and what was not.

## Deliberately not in scope

- **Android and iOS.** The premise breaks at silencing on Android and at enumeration on iOS.
  The Shield app already covers Android for this project.
- **A browser version.** A page cannot see other applications' audio.
- **An in-repo HRTF or binaural renderer**, on any platform. Windows renders headphones through
  the OS; Linux and macOS fold instead.
- **Per-application rerouting through undocumented policy interfaces**, carried over from the
  demo's scope.
- **Store distribution.** Unchanged from the demo: the Windows driver cannot ship through MSIX,
  and the macOS tap's consent model does not fit the sandbox.
- **Per-tab or per-stream separation inside one application.**
