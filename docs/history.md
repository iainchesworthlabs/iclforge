# Implementation history

How the codec was built, in the order it was built. This is a record of what was implemented
and what evidence closed each step, kept out of the README because a landing page is not a
development log. Nothing here supersedes the current [capability and limitation
tables](library/capabilities.md), which
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation)
names, with [Validation](verification.md), as the authority on what the project can and cannot
do. Where this file disagrees with those pages, they are current and this file is stale.

Milestone numbering is as it was used during development. Milestone 4 was folded into 5.

!!! info "Names"
    The family was called AC3Forge when these steps were done, and this record keeps the names of the
    time: `ac3cli`, `ac3gui`, the `ac3::` namespaces, the `AC3FORGE_` variables and `ac3forge` itself.
    [Renamed](renamed.md) puts each beside its new name.

## Milestones 0–2 — a valid syncframe

The encoder emits AC-3 syncframes carrying 2/0 digital silence at any legal bit rate and
sample rate.

`ac3cli silence out.ac3` produces a stream that FFmpeg strict-decodes
(`-err_detect crccheck+bitstream+buffer+explode`) with zero errors to bit-perfect silence, and
that an independent from-spec bitstream parser rates conformant — including the §5.5 layout
constraints (padding placed in in-block skip fields) and both CRC words. `crc1` precedes the
region it covers, so it is solved with a GF(2) polynomial inverse rather than computed
forward.

## Milestone 3 — MDCT and the KBD window

The 512-point Kaiser-Bessel-derived window is generated at compile time from the KBD formula
and reproduces every value of Table 7.33 exactly at the spec's 5-decimal rounding. The forward
MDCT matches independent numpy goldens to ≤ 1e-10. A 50%-overlap TDAC round trip through the
*normative* §7.9.4.1 decoder inverse reconstructs the input to ≤ 1e-10, which locks the
window, both transforms and the −2/N ↔ ×2 level convention together rather than one at a time.

## Milestone 5 — real audio

`ac3cli sine out.ac3` produces AC-3 that FFmpeg strict-decodes to a 999.93 Hz sine at exactly
the target amplitude (+0.000 dB) with 88.3 dB SNR.

The pipeline: windowed MDCT → 25-bit fixed coefficients → D15 exponents mirroring the decoder
→ the bit-exact §7.2.2 integer bit-allocation engine → binary SNR-offset search → §7.3
mantissa quantization with cross-channel grouping → packing and CRCs. The allocation engine
was validated against an independent Python transcription of the spec pseudocode at zero
tolerance. Tables 7.6–7.16 are script-extracted from the spec text with self-verification, as
every table before them was.

## Milestone 6 — 5.1, LFE, and the in-repo decoder

Every audio coding mode (mono through 3/2) plus LFE, at all three sample rates. Exact 44.1 kHz
CBR arrives via Bresenham alternation between the two Table 5.18 frame lengths.

The in-repo decoder, built on the same normative core, reaches float32-precision PCM parity
with FFmpeg's decoder on identical streams: max sample difference 7.9e-6, about −102 dBFS. A
5.1 encode with a different tone per channel decodes through FFmpeg with every channel
carrying its own tone, verifying channel order end to end.

## Milestone 7 — the quality layer

Per-block exponent strategy selection (§8.2.8: D45/D25/D15 chosen by reuse span, triggered by
variation), 2/0 rematrixing (§7.5.3 minimum-power rule, with the decoder-side undo), and
bit-rate-aware bandwidth defaults.

This is the point at which output quality passed FFmpeg's encoder on the SNR metric. Current
numbers are on [Quality trend](quality-trend.md) and [Landscape](landscape.md), and the method is
in [Validation](verification.md); `ac3cli encode` gained arbitrary stereo WAV input here. Decoder parity held on rematrix-active material at max
difference 1.1e-5.

## Milestones 8–9 — space, and getting it to a receiver

The spatial layer (`src/render/src/`) places mono objects on the ITU 5.1 ring by
energy-normalized 2D VBAP with per-block gain ramps and explicit LFE sends. `ac3cli orbit`
renders a tone circling the listener into 5.1 AC-3. An end-to-end test parks the object at
each speaker in turn and asserts the decoded energy follows it: C → L → SL → SR → R.

The IEC 61937 packer (`src/containers/src/iec61937/`) wraps frames into S/PDIF bursts byte-exact against
FFmpeg's `spdif` muxer. `ac3cli spdif` emits them as a PCM16 WAV; played bit-exactly through a
passthrough output, a receiver locks on and lights its Dolby Digital indicator.

## Live capture

`ac3::audio::enumerate_devices` reports every active input endpoint plus every render endpoint as
a loopback source, and `ac3::audio::Capture` streams interleaved float samples through a
lock-free SPSC ring into the encoder. Verified on hardware: a 1 kHz tone played through the
speakers, captured via loopback, encoded and decoded back at exactly 1000.0 Hz with zero ring
overruns. Loopback gaps — a render
endpoint delivers nothing while the machine is silent — are filled against a QPC timeline so
the stream stays continuous.

`ac3cli devices` lists endpoints and `ac3cli record` captures straight to AC-3.

## Exclusive-mode passthrough

`ac3::audio::PassthroughSink` opens a render endpoint in WASAPI exclusive mode with a
`KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_IEC61937_DOLBY_DIGITAL` format, including the documented
buffer-alignment retry, and streams bursts from a lock-free queue on an MMCSS "Pro Audio"
thread. Exclusive mode is mandatory: the shared-mode engine would mix, resample or
volume-scale the bursts and destroy the bit pattern.

`ac3cli outputs` probes every endpoint twice, for AC-3 and for plain exclusive PCM, so an
unavailable device reports *why* — "cannot bitstream" (an analog output) as against "no
exclusive access" (disabled or in use).

When this was written it had not been confirmed against bitstreaming hardware. It has been
since: an Onkyo TX-RZ740 over HDMI locks AC-3, E-AC-3 and signed Atmos sent through
`PassthroughSink` ([Windows](platforms/windows.md#audio-backend-wasapi)).

## Channel coupling

Above the coupling frequency the full-bandwidth channels stop carrying their own coefficients
and share one coupling channel plus per-band coordinates. This is the tool that makes 5.1
viable well below 448 kbit/s. `ac3cli sine … 51c` and `ac3cli encode … couple` enable it.

FFmpeg strict-decodes coupled 5.1. A targeted probe confirms the envelope is
preserved: a channel carrying a 12 kHz tone stays 113 dB above a silent one in that band,
while the region below the coupling frequency is bit-for-bit untouched. The in-repo decoder
reads coupling too — strategy, banded coordinates, phase flags, leak parameters — so coupled
AC-3 round-trips in process.

## E-AC-3

`ac3cli eac3-sine` emits bsid-16 frames carrying real audio in stereo, 5.1, 7.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.4
and 7.1.4.

E-AC-3 is a different container rather than an AC-3 variant: no `crc1`, an arbitrary 11-bit
`frmsiz` instead of a size table (so the 44.1 kHz padding alternation disappears), and
exponent strategies for all six blocks hoisted into a frame-level `audfrm`. Layouts wider than
5.1 ride in dependent substreams beside a self-sufficient 5.1 bed, each with a Table E2.5
`chanmap`; per §E3.8.2 the channels that collide with the bed replace it and the rest extend
the layout.

The decoder followed: the whole of Tables E1.2/E1.3/E1.4, dependent substreams, `chanmap` and
the §E3.8.2 render, at float32-precision parity with FFmpeg (max difference 1.4e-5) on every
layout FFmpeg will read — and reading FFmpeg's own encoder output as well.

That last part was the point. 7.1.4 needs two dependent substreams and FFmpeg refuses any
frame with `substreamid != 0`, proven exhaustively across hand-rolled MKV, FFmpeg Matroska,
MPEG-TS and MP4. A decoder under our control is what closes that gap.

## Annex E coding tools

Spectral extension (§E3.6), the adaptive hybrid transform with gain-adaptive quantization
(§E3.4), and Annex E coupling (§E3.3), each opt-in per `FrameConfig`. The JOC Huffman tables
needed by the object layer were generated here too: TS 103 420 Annex A.1 gives only their
names, modes and types and ships the trees in the companion archive as `ts_103420_tables.c`,
so `tools/generators/gen_joc_tables.py` inverts that file — decoder trees in, encoder codewords
out — and refuses to write unless every tree is a complete prefix code.

The in-repo decoder did not read any of these three at first; that gap closed later (see
"Since" below) — it now reads all three, at every layout including 7.1.4 with all three
stacked.

## Dolby Atmos objects (ETSI TS 103 420)

`ac3cli atmos out.ec3` sends objects orbiting the room at different heights and rates, and
ffprobe reports `eac3 (Dolby Digital Plus + Dolby Atmos), 48000 Hz, 5.1(side)` — the same
shape real DD+ Atmos files probe as.

There are no extra coded channels. The objects are panned into a 5.1 bed that any decoder
plays unchanged, and beside it ride two payloads in an EMDF container (TS 102 366 Annex H)
tucked into a block skip field: OAMD saying where each object is, and JOC saying how to pull
them back out as a per-band matrix over the five downmix channels. Dolby's own DD+ JOC streams
carry the container in a skip field with `auxdatae` clear rather than in the aux field; ours
match, checked against their reference content.

This is also why discrete 7.1.4 was a dead end as a delivery format: real 7.1.4 is JOC over a
5.1 bed, not twelve channels, and no shipping profile allows the two dependent substreams the
discrete layout would need.

The reconstruction matrix is the minimum mean-square estimate `M = P Dᵀ (D P Dᵀ + εI)⁻¹`.
Because the encoder built the downmix it knows `D` exactly instead of estimating it, which
makes the solve near-exact for well-separated objects.

The syntax was checked field-for-field against Dolby's Reference Player and Dolby Media
Encoder as oracles. That diffing found several real bugs: the skip-field carriage above,
`codecdatae=0`, a dynamic-object-only programme with the LFE as an object but not a JOC
output, and metadata flag arrays transmitted index-0-first. It left the frame headers and
container matching Dolby's byte-for-byte on the fields that matter.

Two limits established here are structural and remain: objects sharing a direction cannot be
separated, and Dolby's decoder will not treat these as objects because the stream is not
signed with its key. Both are in the [verification-gap table](verification.md#where-the-oracles-dont-reach).

## Metering and analysis

`ac3/analysis/` meters audio the way a console does: peak with instant attack and a 20 dB/s
fallback, a 1.2 s hold marker, RMS over a 300 ms integration, plus exact whole-signal
statistics and the Gerzon energy vector over the BS.775 ring.

Both front ends draw from it, including for where a level sits on the bar, so a printed figure
and a moving needle cannot disagree. `ac3cli levels` reports any WAV or AC-3 file channel by
channel; `encode`, `decode`, `sine` and `orbit` print the same table when they finish; `record`
meters live. The GUI gained a channel-levels card that relabels itself for the active layout
and a soundfield view. Feeding the meters meant widening both front ends to 1–6 channel WAV
input, with the WAV↔A/52 permutation moved into the library rather than copied into each
caller.

`ac3gui --smoke` and `--smoke-record` drive the file and live-capture paths headlessly and
report what the meters did, so "the display is wired to the audio" is checkable rather than a
screenshot.

## The metadata layer

Everything above decodes; this is what makes it *play* right. An AV receiver reads exactly
these bits to set level, compress dynamics and fold down, and until this point they were all
zero. `dynrng`, `compr`, a measured `dialnorm`, and the downmix levels — see the
[capability table](library/capabilities.md#metadata) for what each one does here.

Verified against the oracle rather than against the bits alone: `tools/checks/check_drc.py` runs 22
checks in which a decode that *applies* the metadata is compared against one that ignores it
(`ffmpeg -drc_scale`, `-heavy_compr`, `-ac 2`), so a stream carrying dead metadata fails.
Measured: 5.24 dB of cut on loud passages, 5.63 dB of boost on quiet ones, programme range
39.0 → 28.1 dB; the `compr` ceiling holds across hard transitions; every downmix level code
moves FFmpeg's own fold-down by the dB Tables 5.9/5.10 specify, to 0.01 dB.
`tools/references/drc_ref.py` is an independent transcription of Tables 7.29/7.30 as
arithmetic-shift lookups, so the bit-packing has a second opinion.

One gap found here and still open: FFmpeg's Annex E header parser skips the compression word,
so E-AC-3 `compr` has no external oracle and is covered bit-by-bit instead.

## Live monitor, E-AC-3/Atmos passthrough, and the live pipeline

Capture→encode already ran live (`EncoderController::startRecording`, `ac3cli record`), but
only ever reached a file, and `PassthroughSink`/`ac3::iec61937::wrap_frame` understood AC-3
bursts only — `playToReceiver` and `ac3cli play` refused anything with `bsid > 8` outright.
Three pieces closed that: `ac3::audio::MonitorSink` (shared-mode WASAPI playback, a
non-bitstreamed preview path), `ac3::iec61937::Eac3BurstPacker` plus a second WASAPI
exclusive-mode format (`make_eac3_format`, `KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_IEC61937_DOLBY_DIGITAL_PLUS`)
for E-AC-3/Atmos passthrough, and `ac3cli live` wiring capture → encode → both, continuously,
with `live --atmos` moving each object's placement every frame from elapsed time — the same
per-frame-recompute shape `atmos`'s synthetic orbit demo already used, now with room for a real
live position source to read from instead of a formula once one exists.

The E-AC-3 burst framing was deliberately not guessed from AC-3's shape. Two primary sources
were fetched live and cross-checked against each other: FFmpeg's `spdif_header_eac3`
(`libavformat/spdifenc.c`) and Microsoft's own "Representing Formats for IEC 61937
Transmissions" documentation, which includes a worked Dolby Digital Plus example. They agree:
data type `0x15` with no extra bits in `Pc` (unlike AC-3's `bsmod`); a burst fixed at 24576
bytes (4x AC-3's), matching WASAPI's own requirement that the carrier clock run at 4x the
content rate for DD+; `Pd` (length) in **bytes**, not bits, unlike AC-3 — confirmed directly
from the source (`ctx->length_code = ctx->hd_buf_filled`, no `<<3`) and sanity-checked against
TrueHD/DTS-HD doing the same for the same reason (bits would overflow the 16-bit field at these
rates); and — the detail that would silently drop channels if missed — the unit fed to the
packer has to be a whole *access unit* (`ac3::split_access_units`), not a lone syncframe, or a
dependent substream's channels never reach the receiver. `tests/sinks/test_iec61937.cpp` is new (the
AC-3 packer had no dedicated tests before this either) and covers both, including real
multi-frame audio and hand-built multi-syncframe accumulation; the `Pd`-in-bits and
burst-size-6144 bugs were both deliberately reintroduced and confirmed to fail the suite before
being reverted.

Building the monitor path against real hardware — not just unit tests — found two bugs
neither would have caught. `MonitorSink::submit()` gated a write on a fixed ~20 ms readiness
threshold smaller than an actual chunk (~32 ms, one AC-3/E-AC-3 frame); `RingBuffer::write()`
then silently performed a *partial* write while `submit()` still reported failure, so the
caller retried the same chunk, duplicating bytes that had already landed and desynchronising
the submitted/rendered counters from what was actually queued. `ac3cli live --atmos` separately
wrote a bed-metering step into the same `views` vector the encoder read object essences from,
sized to the object count (as few as one) rather than the bed's fixed six channels — an
out-of-bounds heap write, surfacing as a crash partway through an otherwise-successful session.
Both are fixed (see `MonitorSink::submit` in `src/audio/src/backend/windows/monitor.cpp` and
`run_live`'s `bed_views` in `apps/cli/commands/live_audio.cpp`).

What that hardware testing did and did not confirm, precisely: `MonitorSink` played real
microphone capture and real decoded AC-3/E-AC-3 (including an Atmos stream's 5.1 bed) through
this machine's Realtek output in real time, end to end, including a live capture→encode→monitor
session. Exclusive-mode E-AC-3 passthrough did not get the same confirmation — this machine has
no S/PDIF/HDMI endpoint behind a real AV receiver, so `IsFormatSupported` was exercised (and
correctly answers no everywhere available) but no receiver had locked onto either the existing
AC-3 burst or the new E-AC-3 one; a later run with a receiver cabled to a Windows machine
confirmed both (see above). See the [verification-gap table](verification.md#where-the-oracles-dont-reach) for the full
account.

## The ALSA backend

Live capture, monitor playback and IEC 61937 passthrough had been WASAPI-only, gated behind
`WIN32` with a no-backend stub everywhere else. `src/audio/src/backend/alsa/` gives Linux a real
implementation of all three, selected by `src/audio/CMakeLists.txt` when libasound's headers are
present (`AC3FORGE_WITH_ALSA=AUTO` by default; `ON` makes their absence a configure error, `OFF`
forces the no-backend fallback) — optional and detected, not a hard new dependency. Capture and
monitor playback are ordinary PCM and any Linux audio API could do them; passthrough is why ALSA
specifically: the IEC 60958 non-audio bit that tells a receiver these bytes are Dolby Digital
rather than music is expressed as ALSA device-name arguments (`iec958:CARD=...,AES0=0x06,...`),
and PulseAudio's and PipeWire's own passthrough paths both end in that same ALSA call made by a
daemon instead of by this code — so ALSA is the layer underneath, not the lowest common
denominator above it. Verified on WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04 (gcc 15.2, clang 21.1) with and without
libasound present, and under ASan+UBSan with leak detection, including the device-independent
halves (device-name construction, channel-status derivation) driven against ALSA's software
`null` PCM. Not verified: any real sound hardware — WSL2 has none. See
[building.md](building.md#linux-audio).

## Per-object Atmos motion

Objects had always been placed once per encode and stayed there — `AtmosEncoder::encode_frame`
already took a fresh `ObjectPlacement` every call, but nothing generated a *sequence* of them.
`ac3/oba/motion.hpp` adds that layer without touching `AtmosEncoder` itself: `KeyframePath`
linearly interpolates an authored `std::vector<Keyframe>` (position, gain, LFE send per point,
holding at the ends rather than extrapolating), `OrbitPath` is the same closed-form circular
orbit the `atmos`/`live --atmos` demos already computed, and `ObjectPath` (a
`std::variant` of the two) plus `evaluate_placements()` turn either into the
`std::span<const ObjectPlacement>` `encode_frame` wants at a given instant. `ac3cli atmos-path`
takes an authored keyframe file; `live --atmos` evaluates an orbit fresh every frame from
elapsed wall-clock time, described in its own doc comment as the shape a future real live
position source drops into.

## The general E-AC-3 channel model

`ac3::plan::LayoutId` only ever named one of seven hand-picked combinations Table E2.5 can
express. `ac3::eac3::chanmap::ChannelPlan` and `chanmap::allocate(locations)` (new in
`eac3_tables.hpp`/`.cpp`) solve the general problem underneath: given an arbitrary bitmask of
Table E2.5 locations, pick the widest Table 5.8 acmod whose own channels are all in the request
as the bed, then bin-pack whatever is left into as many ≤5-full-bandwidth-channel dependents as
it takes (LFE2 held back and placed last, since it needs a full-bandwidth companion in its own
substream). The seven named layouts are now a convenience shortcut for a specific plan rather
than a separate system — `ac3::plan::channel_plan_for(id)` is a one-line lookup into the same
`ChannelPlan` a caller can otherwise build directly via `Plan::custom_locations` and
`parse_channels`/`format_channels` for a channel set no named layout covers.

## Since

- The Matroska muxer (`src/containers/src/matroska/`), deliberately independent of `ac3::forge`.
- `ac3::io::scan`, so a muxer derives format, packet boundaries, sample rate and channel count
  from the bitstream rather than being told.
- `ac3cli` dispatch moved to a single command table, so an argv index cannot be quietly wrong.
- This documentation, and the `examples/` targets behind it.
- AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (`cmake/Sanitizers.cmake`, the
  `linux-llvm-asan-ubsan` preset) and clang-tidy (`.clang-tidy`, a curated `bugprone-*` /
  `clang-analyzer-*` / `performance-*` / narrow `cert-*` set) both promoted to required,
  green CI legs. Both run in the nightly run now, not on each pull request; see
  [CI for many agents](ci-agentic.md).
- libFuzzer harnesses (`fuzz/`) over every untrusted-input entry point — `scan`, both decoders,
  WAV reading, and later AC-4, the containers and the Sendspin messages — Clang-only and off by
  default (`AC3FORGE_BUILD_FUZZERS`); see
  [`fuzz/README.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/fuzz/README.md). Runs on every push (`fuzz-regress`, seed/regression
  replay only) and nightly (`fuzz-nightly`, bounded mutation).
- Dual mono (`acmod` 0, "1+1"): two independent single-channel programmes sharing one
  syncframe rather than a channel layout, on both encoders and both decoders, with their own
  `dialnorm2`/`compr2` metadata pair.
- `fscod2`, Annex E's half sample rates (24, 22.05, 16 kHz) — decoded with the same tables as
  their double-rate parent (§E2.3.1.4), so nothing else about decoding changes. No external
  decode oracle exists for the audio content at these rates, not even Dolby's own Reference
  Player; see the [verification-gap table](verification.md#where-the-oracles-dont-reach).
- Delta bit allocation (§7.2.2.6) on both encoders: corrects bands where the coarse
  exponent-only masking curve and the pre-quantization coefficient magnitude clearly
  diverge. Skipped for the LFE and, on the encode side only, whenever coupling is active that
  frame; both decoders accept it on the coupling channel regardless, from any encoder that
  sends it.
- E-AC-3 variable bit rate (`FrameConfig::vbr`): a quality target with optional min/max kbps
  bounds, per substream — AC-3 has no free frame-size field to vary and stays CBR-only.
- Block switching (§8.2.2 transient detector + §7.9 short transform) on both encoders and both
  decoders: a per-block, per-channel choice between the long 512-point transform and a switched
  pair of 256-point halves, excluding a switching channel from that frame's coupling (and, on
  E-AC-3, AHT). Decoded switch decisions are reported back via `DecodedFrame::blksw`/
  `DecodedSubstream::blksw`, the same tier of diagnostic as `dynrng`.
- The E-AC-3 decoder's three remaining Annex E gaps — coupling, spectral extension and AHT —
  closed, in that order. The decoder now reads every Annex E tool combination the encoder can
  produce, at every layout including 7.1.4 with coupling, spectral extension and AHT all
  stacked together. What it still refuses: enhanced coupling, transient pre-noise processing,
  and (defensively, since this project's own encoder never emits it) the Annex E default
  coupling band structure.
- `ac3gui`'s multi-source input: `ac3::plan::Assignment` (`assignment.hpp`), a sparse
  `(source, channel) → destination` table shared by the CLI's new `src=`/`map=` options and the
  GUI's own per-channel table, so a hand-typed command line and a GUI selection can never
  disagree about what a token means. Automatic single-source panning is unchanged and still the
  default with nothing loaded to disagree about it; `map=`/the GUI table only become mandatory
  once a second source is added.
- Dual mono and E-AC-3 VBR (both already at the library/CLI level — see above) exposed in the
  GUI: `1+1` as a selectable bed, drawn apart from the seven Table 5.8 shapes rather than folded
  into them, and a Rate mode (CBR/VBR) control on the Format tab, gated to E-AC-3 + file output
  (a live session always runs CBR — IEC 61937 passthrough bursts are fixed-size per access unit).
- The Basic/Advanced two-tier control replaced with Guided/Advanced/Expert: Guided is new, a
  five-step wizard (Source, Format, Rate mode, Loudness, Review) over the exact same controller
  state the other two tiers read and write, so switching tiers mid-session is a lossless round
  trip by construction rather than a second copy of the state to reconcile. Advanced and Expert
  are the old Basic and Advanced, one notch further apart.
- Object mode's per-object bookkeeping made aware that an object's index can mean a different
  (source, channel) once more than one file is loaded: `objectModel`'s own source label names
  the file an object came from once there is more than one to distinguish, and removing a
  non-primary source now resets authored object placements/motion rather than risk one silently
  reattaching to a different channel that shifted into the same index.
- Live session's own remaining disagreements with the rest of the app closed: starting a live
  Atmos session no longer permanently overwrites a loaded file's own authored objects (saved and
  restored around the session instead), a warning appears before Start if VBR is on (a live
  session always drops it), and the window title reflects an active session the same way it
  already did for a plain recording.
- `ac3gui --smoke-shot` (`apps/gui/main.cpp`): grabs a window screenshot without encoding
  anything, for documentation screenshots where a specific UI state matters and a completed run
  in the strip would be noise. The existing `--smoke`/`--smoke-record`/`--smoke-live` property
  mechanism gained two special-cased tokens alongside it — `preset=` (invokes
  `applyChannelPreset()`) and `src2=` (invokes `addSourceFile()`) — plus a fallback to the root
  QML window's own properties (`tier=`, `currentTab=`) for the handful of things that
  deliberately live off `EncoderController`.

## Enhanced coupling and transient pre-noise processing

The two Annex E tools left refused above are now implemented on both encoder and decoder, closing
the last gap in the tool table. Enhanced coupling (§E3.5) reuses the existing coupling machinery's
shape but not its content: 22 sub-bands instead of 18, amplitude/angle/chaos-quantized complex
coordinates instead of per-band scale factors, and a new decode path — §3.5.5's four
steps, built on a new `dft512` (a direct O(N²) complex DFT; correctness-by-transcription first,
same stance as the MDCT before it) rather than anything the MDCT machinery already had. A real
§3.3.2 `nrematbd` conformance bug (the enhanced-coupling branch of the rematrix band count formula
was missing on both sides, and the decoder's `ecplbegf` was a local variable losing its value
exactly where that formula needed it) and a systematic 2:1 gain error in the FFT reconstruction
path were both found by testing, not by inspection. The encoder's own coordinate fit is an MVP:
amplitude-only, `angle`/`chaos` always zero, documented in `FrameConfig::enhanced`'s own comment
and covered by a dedicated lower-threshold regression test rather than silently accepted. Enhanced
coupling composes with spectral extension the same way standard coupling always has — the initial
implementation didn't (a conditionally-emitted `ecplendf` was missing its `spx.in_use` guard),
closed as an immediate follow-up.

Transient pre-noise processing (§3.7) is architecturally unrelated to coupling: a post-IMDCT PCM
correction that time-scale-synthesizes over quantization pre-echo ahead of a coded transient,
reusing the same `TransientDetector` block switching already relies on rather than a second
independent one. Its consequence is entirely on the decoder's calling convention, not its DSP:
`transprocloc` can address samples in the *previous* frame, so a correction can't be finalized
until the *next* frame's fields are known, meaning `Eac3Decoder::decode_substream` holds one frame
back at a time once a stream turns the tool on and a new `Eac3Decoder::flush()` is required to
collect the last one at end-of-stream. `decode_access_unit` initially punted on the general case —
refusing any access unit where a substream used the tool — because the tool is a per-substream
flag and an access unit needs every substream ready in the same call. Built out properly instead:
substreams that release early are queued per identity (`std::deque`, not a single slot) until the
lagging one catches up. That queue mattered for real — the first version used a single-slot cache,
which a test built specifically to catch it (an independent using the tool lagging behind a
dependent that never does) proved would silently overwrite a still-unconsumed result and splice
two different time instants into one corrupted access unit.

Neither tool has any external decode oracle — FFmpeg's own Annex E parser has never read either
one's syntax, which is weaker than 7.1.4's situation (a syntax it reads but rejects on one field):
it has no model of the bits at all, so strict-decoding a stream that uses either tool isn't merely
unavailable, it would reject a correctly-formed stream on syntax it doesn't recognise. Verification
is self-consistency only: round-trip unit tests in `tests/ac3/decoder/test_eac3_decoder.cpp`, and
`tools/ci/quality_race.py`'s CI gate, extended with a `decode_scores_ours` path that decodes through
this project's own `ac3cli decode` instead of FFmpeg for exactly these two tools, with SNR/LSD
floors sized off a measured run rather than guessed.

## Enhanced coupling's real angle/chaos fit

The amplitude-only MVP above was closed by `fit_ecpl_band` (`src/ac3/src/encoder/eac3_frame.cpp`):
§3.5.5.4's reconstruction turns out to be linear in the complex gain a band's (amplitude, angle)
pair expresses — the same shared coupling channel folded through unity gain at angle 0 and at
angle 0.5 (a quarter-turn) spans every gain a single coordinate pair could ever produce, so fitting
the pair that best matches a channel's real coefficients is an exact 2-variable linear least
squares, not a search or an approximation. Chaos does not reduce the same way — §3.5.5.3 adds
chaos-scaled noise to the fitted angle independently per bin, a discontinuous effect no extra
linear degree of freedom absorbs - but `ecpl_rand_notrans` is a pure, deterministic function of
(channel, bin), the *exact* sequence the decoder will use, so instead of a statistical proxy for
how much decorrelation a band needs, the encoder searches its 8 legal codes directly: reconstruct
the band exactly as the decoder would for each, keep whichever lands closest to the original
channel by squared error.

The regression test built for the amplitude-only MVP (two channels' different tones forced into
one 6-bin coupling band, the narrowest §E3.5.2 allows) measured the improvement directly rather
than assuming one: ~3 dB under the old fit, ~6 dB under the new one. That is the ceiling this
test was designed to demonstrate rather than defeat, since no single coordinate
pair per band can fully separate two different signals sharing that few bins; the test's
own comment and threshold were updated to say so rather than imply the tool has been made
transparent there. Verified against real gcc-15, clang-21 and MSVC builds before landing, following
the lesson from the previous merge: a feature exercised only on one compiler locally is not
verified everywhere the fleet is required to be green.

## E-AC-3 rematrixing

E-AC-3's `acmod` 2/0 rematrixing had always emitted valid but permanently-off syntax — `rematflg`
unconditionally zero, `rematstr` never claiming a change — even though the bitstream field layout
and the in-repo decoder's undo path were both already complete. Only the encoder's own §7.5.3
minimum-power decision was missing, and it turned out to need no new decision logic at all:
Annex E §3.3's "Modifications to Previously Defined Parameters" touches `nrematbd` (how many of
Table 7.25's four bands are active, given whichever of coupling/enhanced coupling/spectral
extension takes over the top of the spectrum first) and nothing else about rematrixing — the band
boundaries and the decision rule are exactly AC-3's own. `kRematrixBands` (previously a local
table private to the AC-3 encoder) moved to `ac3/core/tables.hpp` as shared, format-agnostic
infrastructure, and both decoders' own independent copies of the same four ranges were pointed at
it too, closing a three-way literal duplication risk that predated this work rather than adding a
new one.

Two existing bit-placement tests (`tests/ac3/encoder/test_eac3.cpp`) had hardcoded `rematflg` at zero,
true only because the encoder never set it before; both now assert engagement (at least one
band fires) for their already-correlated test material instead, catching the field's PRESENCE
without pinning a value that is legitimately content-dependent. The existing stereo round-trip
test's identical-tone case already exercised the decoder's real undo path end to end once
rematrixing went live, without needing a new test written for it. Verified against real gcc-15,
clang-21 and MSVC builds, plus clang-tidy, before landing.

## AC-4

AC-4 (ETSI TS 103 190) was built in the phases [`planning/ac4.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/ac4.md)
sets out, from the standard's two parts alone. The inspector came first (`src/ac4`): sync frames,
the table of contents, presentations and substream framing, checked against Annex G's CRC-16 over
every sync frame of the committed Dolby Encoding Engine (DEE) streams, MediaInfo's reading of them,
and a Python transcription (`tools/references/ac4_parse.py`) that caught three of its bugs. Fuzzing
it first ran uninstrumented; the instrumented runs then found out-of-bounds reads, an integer
overflow and a loop that never ended on malformed input.

The decoder's syntax layer is transcribed twice, in C++ and in `tools/references/ac4_syntax.py`, and
the two traces have to agree element for element over every committed stream, a census of 107 local
DEE streams and the public DASH-IF, CTA WAVE and Chromium streams. Neither part of the standard says
what correct output is: there is no conformance clause, tolerance, reference decoder or test vector,
and the one open decoder that reads AC-4, librempeg's, does not read all of it. So each later phase
(PCM for stereo, the QMF domain with A-SPX and companding, the 5.X and 7.X elements, A-CPL, every
frame rate with the output level, DRC, dialogue enhancement and the downmix, presentations, the
immersive element and A-JOC objects) was scored against the sources DEE encoded, by SNR,
log-spectral distance, ViSQOL and each A-SPX tile's energy, and against librempeg's decoder where it
reads the stream. About seventy places where the standard's pseudocode, a formula and a table
disagree are kept in `src/ac4/ERRATA.md` with the reading taken and its evidence. Two of them
changed the output: the QMF synthesis modulation offset, where only Pseudocode 66's 255 reconstructs
(78 dB, against 43 dB for the formula's 257), and A-SPX's pre-flattening, which the standard prints
as the inverse of the gain it needs and which left the top of DEE's 5.1 film centre 4.6 dB under the
source at 256 kbps.

The encoder (`src/ac4/src/encoder`) followed each decoder phase that reads what it writes, sharing
`src/ac4/src/core`'s transforms, and was raced against DEE's streams of the same sources. In stereo in
the SIMPLE mode at 192 kbps its SNR was 5.6 dB above DEE's on music and 14.9 dB on speech, with
ViSQOL within 0.02. The races also found that a tone sweeping above A-SPX's crossover left the band
empty in the encoder's streams, which phase E10 fixed by measuring the share of each noise group's
energy that the decoder's patch delivers. DEE's licence ends on 2026-11-06 and is not renewed, so
two phases (G0 and G1) made the streams the other phases would need while it ran.

The applications came last: `ac3cli`, Hearth, the Forge GUI, the C API and the Python, Rust and
WebAssembly bindings, then the immersive and object content in each. IEC 61937 carriage was written
from IEC 61937-14 with no receiver to try it on. The decoder's arithmetic moved to `float` on the
host and its memory came down before it ran on an ESP32-P4, where 2.0 decodes in real time and the
wider layouts do not.
