# Loading a source

The left rail — "the signal" — is where audio comes in. Three numbered blocks, always visible
regardless of which tab is active on the right.

## 01 · Input

One input, with a **File / Live capture** selector at the top — there are no separate cards for
the two, because they are the same thing to the encoder: a list of sources whose channels get
routed onto the plan.

### File

**Choose WAV…** opens a file picker. Each loaded source gets a row — filename, channel count,
duration, what its channels *do* (`feeds the bed`, `2 objects · 4 to the bed`, `unassigned` —
derived from the same assignment rows the table edits, so the rail and the table can never
disagree), a numeric **Start offset** field, a small **level pip** (see below), and a **Remove**
button — and a totals strip beneath the list sums the session (`RATE 48 000 · SOURCES 2 · 8 ch ·
LENGTH 0:02`):

Dragging a WAV file onto the window from Explorer/Finder/the file manager does the same thing as
**Choose WAV…**/**+ Add files…**, without opening the picker — the whole window is a drop target,
not just the rail. Drop an already-encoded `.ac3`/`.ec3` file instead and it does not become a
source at all: it opens in the [stream player](open-stream.md) for playback/export, the same as
picking it from **Open stream…**. `forge-gui` also accepts a file path on the command line
(`forge-gui recording.wav`, `forge-gui mix.ec3`) and applies the identical WAV-vs-stream distinction at
launch. The distinction is by suffix, `.ac3` and `.ec3` alone: an `.ac4` file dropped or named on
the command line is read as a WAV source and refused, and **Open stream…** is the way in for it.
`forge-gui` claims no file type with the desktop (the `.ac3`/`.ec3` associations belong to
[Hearth](../../hearth/index.md); the [window overview](index.md) lists what each platform registers),
so double-clicking an encoded file in the file manager does not start it (a Windows package built
without Hearth is the one exception).

The row reports the channel *count*, not a layout name — the output layout is chosen
independently on the [Format tab](format-and-channels.md) and need not match the source. What a
newly loaded file *starts* as is the file's own: a WAV whose header states which speakers its
channels are (a `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` channel mask — `forge decode` writes one from three
channels up) selects exactly that bed, so a front-left, front-right, back-centre file is a 2/1
bed and not a 5.1 with silent surrounds, and it folds by that mode's §7.8 coefficients; a file
that states none is read by its width, as before. A source
narrower than the chosen output layout leaves the missing channels silent; a wider one folds down
per §7.8 using the centre/surround downmix levels on the [Metadata tab](metadata.md), *unless*
more than one source is loaded — see below.

Each **file** row's level pip is a whole-programme peak/RMS reduction over that source's own
channels, computed *before* routing — every channel pooled into one reading, so it answers "how
loud is this file" independently of where its channels currently go. This differs from the
coded-channel meters in **02 · Levels** below, which read the plan instead; the pip is computed in
the same background pass that renders loaded sources for those meters, so it lags an edit by the
same small amount. Live capture rows show no pip — a device's level belongs to the capture chain
the Live session tab already reports on, not this reduction.

**Start offset** delays a source's own channels by that many seconds of leading silence — all of
them shift together, encoded exactly as `forge`'s `offset=` token would (see
[CLI → Options & grammars](../cli/metadata-options.md)), never as a change to the audio itself. It
is the same field the Objects tab's timeline shows as a draggable clip band (see
[Objects & motion](objects-and-motion.md#per-source-offsets-and-keyframe-timing)) — editing either
one moves the other. The totals strip's `LENGTH` grows to cover it: once any offset is set, it
reads `max(offset + duration)` over every source, not just the longest source's own raw length,
so a source pushed out further is never implied to have been cut short.

**+ Add files…** appends another WAV rather than replacing the primary. A source whose rate
doesn't match the primary's is resampled to it right here at load — a proper offline
windowed-sinc conversion, not the cheap interpolation a live capture's drift correction uses —
and its row's duration line grows a small `44.1→48 k` label so the resample is never invisible.
Only a primary whose own rate has no legal AC-3 target at all refuses the add outright, since
resampling to an illegal rate would just move the problem. With two or more sources loaded,
automatic fold-down no longer applies: every loaded channel needs an explicit destination in the
[assignment table](source-assignment.md), which the **Assign** link beside the button jumps to.

### Live capture

A per-device list, mirroring the File branch just above: one row per **selected** device (not
every endpoint the platform reports — that full list lives in the **Add input…** picker below),
each showing its name, `N ch · 48 000 Hz`, and a **Remove** button. Below the list, **Add input…**
picks from a combo of every enumerated endpoint — microphones and playback-device loopbacks, the
system default marked `[default]` — and adds it as a new row; **capped at two devices per
session**, with a note explaining why once the cap is reached. A totals line beneath the list sums
the selection (`2 devices · 4 channels captured`), and **Refresh** re-enumerates the platform's
endpoints.

The first row is always the **master**, whose delivery paces the session exactly as a
single-device session always has; a second row, when added, is the **slave** — its stream is
resampled in software to track the master's clock rather than sharing one, since two WASAPI
endpoints never do. See [Live capture & session → Two-device
capture](live-session.md#two-device-capture-clock-master-model) for the clock model, the drift
readout, and how the two devices' channels compose in the flat capture-channel space object slots
address.

Two ways to run right here — both act on the **master** device alone, same as a single-device
session always has:

- **Monitor** starts a live session that writes *nothing* — no filename is asked for, the meters
  and soundfield run against the real encoded-and-decoded-back signal, an accent square and a
  `monitoring 12.4 s` readout count it, and the button becomes **Stop**. Checking the signal
  never commits to a take, never opens a run entry, and never steals the tab you are
  configuring.
- **Record…** captures to a file (the button becomes **Stop** with a live elapsed readout). By
  default it writes straight to the output folder under a timestamped take name following the
  naming pattern — the status line and run strip say where; a
  [capture preference](index.md#preferences) makes it ask for a filename first instead.

Setting up a *real* session — writing the take to disk, adding a receiver leg, or both, with
either device — is not a control on this block. It happens on the **Live session** tab, whose own
Card covers the take's idle and running states, the durability guarantees behind an incremental
write, the per-device drop watchdog, and the VBR note — see
[Live capture & session](live-session.md) for all of it.

A capture endpoint feeds the encoder the same way a file does — same format, same layout, same
metadata — its channels are just routed onto whatever layout is selected, live, instead of read
from disk. With two devices selected, the master's channels alone reach a plain channel-mode
session's bed (see the two-device page linked above for why); both devices' channels reach a live
Atmos session's object slots.

!!! note "Platform backend"
    Live capture needs the platform's audio backend (WASAPI on Windows, CoreAudio on macOS, ALSA
    on Linux). See
    [Platform notes](../../platforms/windows.md) for what's actually hardware-confirmed on each OS —
    the block reports itself unavailable on a build with no backend, rather than failing to load.

## 02 · Levels

One meter row per **coded** channel of the current *plan* — named and ordered as A/52 Table 5.8
and its Annex E extensions define them, under a −60…0 dB scale, with the layout's shape name as
the block's headline:

![7.1.4 plan fed by a 6-channel source, after a run](screenshots/channel-levels-live.png)

**The meters follow the plan, not just the file.** Loading a source renders it through the actual
routing in the background and publishes whole-programme peak/RMS per coded channel, so a bed
click, an extras tick or an [assignment](source-assignment.md) edit answers with real numbers. A
channel the routing feeds carries its true level; a channel nothing feeds is drawn at reduced
opacity reading `-∞`, so "correctly silent" stays distinguishable from "meter wired to nothing."
The footer counts the same fed set the soundfield dots use (`8 of 12 coded channels fed by the
assignments.`), on an accent rule whenever something is carried silent.

A **Coded / Rendered** toggle switches between every transmitted channel (silent ones included)
and only what a receiver actually drives — the two differ whenever a dependent substream's own
channels replace part of the bed (§E3.8.2), and in object mode, where the bed is what the objects
are panned onto. During a run, a red dot and the word **live** appear beside the headline while
metering updates in real time (~30 snapshots/sec); once the run finishes, the bars settle on the
exact whole-file peak/RMS, with per-channel **CLIP** indicators.

**CLIP latches**: once a channel clips during a run, its box stays lit — not just the newest
snapshot — until it's clicked (clearing that one channel) or a new transport starts (encode,
record, a live session, the Objects tab's motion preview), which clears every channel's latch at
once. Browsing the assignment table or switching tabs never clears one, so a clip caught mid-file
is never missed just because the level was back under 0 dBFS by the time you looked.

## 03 · Soundfield

Two square plan views — **Ear level** and, whenever the plan carries height channels, **Ceiling**
(a flat ring can't show a ceiling layer, so there are two rings) — each scaling to half the
rail's width rather than pinning at a thumbnail. One dot per position at its real angle: **solid
when a source feeds it, hollow when the stream carries it silent**, each dot brightening with
its own live level, plus the energy vector the analysis layer computes. Mono draws too — one dot
at centre is a true statement about where the sound sits; only dual mono has nothing
to draw. The LFE is stated, not drawn — it has no direction, so a caption beneath the rings
reads `one low-frequency channel · no direction` (or `two independent low-frequency channels` on
a 7.2.4) instead of a dot pretending it has a place.

A `1+1` dual-mono bed replaces the plans entirely with two named programme cards — dual mono has
no soundstage to draw (see [Dual mono](format-and-channels.md#dual-mono)).
