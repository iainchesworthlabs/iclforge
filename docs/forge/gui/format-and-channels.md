# Format & channels

The Format tab is the one tab always present in Advanced and Expert — Guided covers the same
state through its Speakers and Quality steps instead (see
[Guided, Advanced, Expert](index.md#guided-advanced-expert)). This page describes the tab, top to
bottom: presets and the derived codec, the two-tier channel picker, the routing strip, and the
assignment table.

## Presets, codec, bit rate, container

A row of layout **presets** (5.1, 7.1, 5.1.4, 7.1.4, 7.2.4 — starting points, not the
model: they set the bed, LFE count and extras together, but the channel picker below is what the
encode plan actually reads), then **Codec**, **Bit rate**, and **Container** (elementary stream,
Matroska, S/PDIF, MP4, fragmented MP4/CMAF, or MPEG-TS — see below):

![E-AC-3, 7.1.4 preset, rear + ceiling extras on](screenshots/format-eac3-714.png)

**The codec follows the channels.** *Any* extra — rear, ceiling, a second LFE — needs Dolby
Digital Plus, so ticking one under plain AC-3 *promotes the codec on the spot* (with a
confirmation first, if the [Explanations preference](index.md#preferences) asks for one); while
anything is forcing it, the field reads *Codec — follows the channels* (or *fixed by object
mode*) and is disabled. With nothing forcing it — a plain bed, with or without its LFE — the
choice is real (both codecs carry it, and VBR needs E-AC-3), so the field is live
there. What never happens is a circular gate where extras are locked behind a codec the extras
themselves change.

The plan strip above the tabs updates live: `E-AC-3 · 7.1.4 · 192 kbps · .ec3` (or
`quality 75 · ≥192 · ≤640` in VBR mode, bounds included), with a sub-line counting what differs
when it does (`12 speakers from 12 coded channels · 2 dependent substreams`; in object mode it
counts the fed bed positions live — `4 of 6 bed positions fed · JOC + OAMD · objects carry the
height` — even mid-drag). See
[Options & grammars](../cli/metadata-options.md#the-layout-grammar).

The **Bit rate** list carries the nominal rates from 96 kbps up (thirteen rungs, 96 through 640)
plus a 768 kbps rung that exists for E-AC-3 only — E-AC-3 signals its frame size directly rather
than indexing Table 5.18, and a wide object or 7.2.4 session wants it. Switching back to AC-3 clamps an over-table rate to
640 rather than leaving a plan `validate()` would refuse at encode time. With AC-4 the list is
its own: 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 144, 192, 256, 320, 384, 448, 512, 640 and 768 kbps, the rungs
DEE's streams use, and the encoder refuses one a layout cannot be coded at.

A muted line can appear under the field itself: *"N coded channels at M kbps will audibly
starve — encoders refuse outright below the frame minimum."* This is a field-level hint, not a
second gate — it fires when the rate works out to less than roughly 77 kbps per full-bandwidth
coded channel (LFE excluded), the same per-channel rate the object-mode 384 kbps advice already
implies for a 5.1 bed (384 / 5). Nothing here refuses an encode; a deliberate stress test at an
implausibly low rate still runs, right up to the frame's own hard minimum, which is a separate,
harder line enforced only at encode time. Object mode's own 384 kbps warning (below) takes over
instead of this one whenever objects are in play, so the two are never shown together. Guided's
Quality step shows the same idea in plain language when a wide room still has "Good" selected.

**Container**'s remaining four options all work for both codecs and are all, like Matroska, a
*second* command over the finished elementary stream — pasting one command would otherwise write
a raw elementary stream into a file the receiver or player expects a different format for:

| Container | Produces (exactly what its `forge` subcommand does) | Command | Atmos signaling |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S/PDIF (.wav)** | The stream's IEC 61937 bursts as a 2-channel 16-bit PCM WAV, playable bit-exactly (100% volume, no mixing) into an S/PDIF or HDMI output so a receiver locks onto it | `forge encode … out.ac3 && forge spdif out.ac3 out.wav` | none |
| **MP4 (.mp4)** | A spec-correct ISOBMFF file with a `dac3`/`dec3` sample-entry box built off the bitstream (fscod, bsid, bsmod, acmod, lfeon — ETSI TS 102 366 Annex F) | `forge encode … out.ac3 && forge mp4 out.ac3 out.mp4` | `flag_ec3_extension_type_a` (TS 103 420 §8.3.2.2) |
| **fragmented MP4/CMAF** | A *folder*, not a file — the save dialog switches to a folder picker for this one choice: an init segment (`init.mp4`), one CMAF media segment per fragment (1.536 s each at 48 kHz), an HLS media/master playlist pair (RFC 8216), and a DASH MPD (ISO/IEC 23009-1), ready for a packager or CDN origin | `forge encode … out.ac3 && forge fmp4 out.ac3 out_dir` | `CHANNELS="<N>/JOC"` on the HLS rendition, the `EC3_ExtensionType`/`EC3_ExtensionComplexityIndex` descriptors in the MPD (clause D.2), and the `ceao` compatibility brand on the segments |
| **MPEG-TS (.ts)** | A DVB-profile MPEG-2 Transport Stream: stream_type 0x06 plus the AC3_descriptor/Enhanced_AC3_descriptor (ETSI EN 300 468 Annex D.3/D.5) | `forge encode … out.ac3 && forge ts out.ac3 out.ts` | none — DVB's descriptors carry no JOC marker |

S/PDIF is the one exception on codec support in practice, not in principle: an E-AC-3 stream's
carrier runs at four times the content sample rate (Dolby Digital Plus over IEC 60958/61937),
which is legal and expected, if unusual for a plain PCM16 file.

Of the four containers above, only **fragmented MP4/CMAF** carries over to a **live session** the
way Matroska does: `EncoderController::openLiveOutputWriters` wires exactly two incremental
writers, `iclforge::containers::matroska::Writer` and `iclforge::containers::mp4::FragmentWriter`, and **MP4**, **S/PDIF** and **MPEG-TS** all
fall through to writing the plain elementary stream when a live session starts — the same file
Elementary stream itself would produce live. That is a limit of the live path, not of the
containers: a **recording** (the Record button's capture-to-file take) goes through
`RecordingSink` instead, which does write S/PDIF and MPEG-TS properly. See
[Live capture & session → Take durability](live-session.md#take-durability) for what separates
them.

## Rate mode: Constant or Variable

E-AC-3 only, and file output only — the control disappears entirely for AC-3 (no free word count
to vary; `frmsizecod` indexes a fixed table), in object mode, and whenever the **live source is
selected** (IEC 61937 passthrough bursts are fixed-size per access unit — see
[Live capture & session](live-session.md#the-vbr-warning)):

![The rate-mode panel absent while a live source is selected](screenshots/format-vbr.png)

**Constant** (the default) is the plain **Bit rate** dropdown above. **Variable** adds a
**Quality** slider, 0 (smallest) to 100 (best) — encoder-relative, not a fixed target, and *not*
linear in bit cost: cost rises steeply above roughly half the range, so a high quality with no
upper bound will often refuse real programme material outright (`FrameError::kInvalidBitrate`)
rather than silently producing an oversized frame. Two checkboxes, **Set a minimum bit rate**
and **Set a maximum bit rate**, each enable the kbps field beside them when ticked (the field stays
visible either way, just disabled) — presence lives on the
checkbox, never a sentinel value: *"Bounds are optional — unticked means no bound at all, not a
default one"*, as the line beneath says, before stating the current bounds in words. **Bit
rate** above still matters in VBR mode — its label relabels itself *band-edge reference, not a
target*: it keeps feeding the same coupling/spectral-extension band-edge defaults it always
has.

A finished VBR run reports what it actually spent, since it has no target: the run strip reads
`VBR q75 · avg 512 kbps (384–704)` instead of a plain `NNN kbps` figure. At the foot of the
panel, a monospace `forge vbr token` readout shows the exact
`q:<quality>[,min:<kbps>][,max:<kbps>]` string that reproduces the current setting — see
[CLI → Options & grammars](../cli/metadata-options.md#the-vbr-token-eac3-encode-only).

## Channels — the two-tier picker

A budget counter in the section header (`12 of 16 positions used · 14 coded channels` — Table
E2.5's channel space on one side, what the stream actually transmits on the other) tracks the
whole selection. Beneath it, the two tiers:

1. **Bed — pick one.** Eight buttons: `1+1` (dual mono, drawn with a dashed border because it is
   categorically different — two programmes, not a speaker shape), then `1/0` through `3/2`,
   each showing its channel names. There is no "no bed" state — the format cannot carry any
   channel, ceiling ones included, without one.
2. **Low frequency — a count, not a flag.** Three buttons: **None**, **One · LFE**, **Two ·
   LFE + LFE2**. Two means two *independent* low-frequency channels carrying different signal —
   not one signal sent to two subwoofers — which is what makes a 7.2.4 rather than a 7.1.4 (and,
   like everything past a bed and its LFE, needs Dolby Digital Plus). "Two" is really a checkbox
   for the same "lfe2" extra the row below shares its allocator check with, so it needs at least
   one other extra already ticked — LFE2 has to share a dependent substream with a full-bandwidth
   channel, and a bare bed's own LFE never counts as one. Unreachable on its own (bed + LFE +
   LFE2, nothing else — the shape a bare "5.2" preset would have named), the button greys out and
   prints why, the same as an Extras row below.
3. **Extras — added to the bed.** Four checkbox rows — front wide, rear surround, ceiling front,
   ceiling rear — each a *pair* that toggles together (you can't add a left ceiling channel
   without its right pair), each printing the channel tokens it adds (`Lw Rw`) in the same
   Table E2.5 names the channel map uses. A row that can't currently be ticked says why in its
   own right-hand column: `fixed by object mode`, `not part of dual mono`, the allocator's own
   refusal at the 16-position cap (`a single programme can render at most 16 channels (A/52
   Annex E, §E3.8.2)`), `another extra needs this one` on a ticked pair whose removal would
   strand a channel depending on it, or (when unticked under AC-3) `moves to Dolby Digital
   Plus` — the cost stated only while it is actually true.

    !!! note "No ceiling middle"
        The design handoff sketched a third ceiling pair ("ceiling middle"). A/52 Table E2.5 has
        no such location — only Vhl/Vhr and Lts/Rts pairs exist — so it is not offered rather
        than invented.

The derived shape name (`5.1`, `7.1.4`, `7.2`, …) follows the selection —
`<ear-level count>.<LFE count>[.<ceiling count>]` — so an unnamed combination still reads
correctly. Substreams are not a UI concept: the picker expresses a set of positions, and which
substream carries what is the encoder's business.

### Dual mono

Not a speaker layout at all — two independent, single-channel programmes sharing one syncframe
(§5.4.2's "1+1 dual mono"). Selecting it clears the LFE and extras and greys those controls with
the reason (`not part of dual mono`); an accent note under the picker says what 1+1 is *for*
(a second language, a commentary track — chosen by the listener, never mixed); the routing
sentence states the multiplex plainly; the channel map shows the two `p1`/`p2` tags; the
soundfield plans are replaced with two named programme cards; and the meters read
**Program 1 / Program 2** — never a correlated pair:

![1+1 selected: LFE count and extras locked, programme cards in the rail](screenshots/format-dual-mono.png)

The two programmes' channels come from either one two-channel WAV (automatic: ch 1 → programme 1,
ch 2 → programme 2) or any loaded channels assigned `Programme 1` / `Programme 2` in the
[assignment table](source-assignment.md). Each programme gets its own **dialnorm**, **DRC
profile**, and (Expert) **heavy compression** on the [Metadata tab](metadata.md#loudness)
(`dialnorm2`/`drc2`/`heavy2` for programme 2) — the two programmes are unrelated, so programme 2's
curve is never inherited from programme 1's; a plan that wants both compressed alike sets both
explicitly. `dialnorm=auto`/`dialnorm2=auto` measure each programme independently from its own
coded channel — never a blend of the two, since Ch1 and Ch2 share no downmix to average across
(§E1.3).

## Routing — what happens to this source

A **Source → Coded** strip (`2 sources · 8 ch → 8 coded · 6 spk` — the coded/speaker split, so a
dependent substream's replaced channels stop being invisible bookkeeping), a generated sentence
describing what the routing actually does (naming any coded position carried silent), and a
**channel map**: one tag per coded position, filled when a source feeds it and outlined when it
is carried silent — the before-the-fact half of the same answer the meters' fed footer gives
during a run.

## Assignments

The full per-channel assignment table lives here, for any number of sources — one row per loaded
channel with a destination dropdown. With one source and nothing set, rows read **Automatic**
(the routing panned them for you); everything else is explicit. This is the model the meters, the
soundfield, the routing sentence and the CLI line all derive from — it has its own page:
[Multi-source & assignment](source-assignment.md).

## Loudness and passthrough

**Advanced** adds a **Loudness** section here (DRC profile and dialnorm only — the rest of
[Metadata](metadata.md) lives on its own tab in Expert, which absorbs Loudness so it appears
exactly once), with a ghost link jumping to Expert. **Passthrough to a receiver** appears in both
Advanced and Expert — a device dropdown annotated with what each endpoint can bitstream,
**Refresh**, and **Play** for sending the last encode straight out as IEC 61937 bursts:

![Advanced tier, post-run: fed meters, Loudness section, completed run in the strip](screenshots/format-advanced-postrun.png)

![Expert tier: the full Format tab down to Passthrough](screenshots/format-expert-passthrough.png)

**Play greys out for an endpoint that cannot bitstream the encoded stream** — the device labels
already say what each accepts (`AC-3 + E-AC-3 ready`, `cannot bitstream`, …), and the button
reads them rather than failing after the click. AC-3 rides data-type-1 bursts and E-AC-3
data-type-21 bursts at four-times rate. See [Live capture & session](live-session.md) for the
live equivalent, and [Platform notes](../../platforms/windows.md) for which platforms have this
hardware-confirmed.

Every **finished run chip in the run strip** (not just the most recent one) carries this same
Play, sending *that* run's own output rather than whatever the most recent encode happened to
produce — see [the window layout's own run strip section](index.md#the-window) for the chip-level
detail, including how a run encoded through Guided's amp destination carries its device pick along
with it so Play there needs no fresh pick.

## AC-4

**Codec** offers AC-4 (ETSI TS 103 190) as its third choice. AC-4 encodes the loaded source in its
own layout, the way `forge ac4-encode` takes a WAV file: mono, stereo, 5.0 or 5.1, one source,
no assignment and no start offset. Choosing AC-4 sets the bed to the source's layout, clears the
extras, and leaves **Container** at Elementary stream (a raw `.ac4` of sync frames) or MP4; the
other containers are refused when Encode is pressed, as is a bed that is not the source's. A
preset or an extra that needs a dependent substream moves the codec to E-AC-3, as it does from
AC-3. Object mode leaves the codec at AC-4 or E-AC-3 and greys out AC-3's entry. A live session
encodes AC-3 or E-AC-3 only.

The **AC-4** tab takes the place of Coding tools and Metadata, which belong to the other two
codecs, in Advanced as well as Expert (Guided has no such tab), and its badge counts the options it
adds to the command line:

| Control | `forge ac4-encode` option | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Frame rate | `frame-rate=` (Part 1 Table 83; native alone at 44.1 kHz) | native, 2 048-sample frames |
| Rate mode | `rate-mode=constant\|average\|variable` | constant |
| Codec mode | `codec-mode=simple\|aspx\|aspx-acpl-1\|aspx-acpl-2\|aspx-acpl-3` | chosen by the bit rate |
| I-frame interval, 1 to 1 000 | `iframe-interval=` | 24 frames |
| CRC on each raw sync frame | `crc=off` (a raw stream only; an MP4 sample has none) | on |
| dialnorm, in quarter-dB steps | `dialnorm=0..31.75` | 31 |
| Measure dialnorm from the programme | `dialnorm=auto` | off |
| Loudness values | `loudness=<practice>`, which names dialnorm too | off |
| DRC profile | `drc=<profile>` | off |
| Stereo downmix: centre, surround, preferred (a 5.0 or 5.1 source) | `cmixlev=`, `surmixlev=`, `dmixmod=` | the stream's defaults |
| Dialogue in L, R, C; Raise the Mid of L and R; Largest dialogue boost | `dialogue-channels=`, `dialogue-method=mid`, `dialogue-max-gain=` | off, 9 dB |

The command bar echoes one command, `forge ac4-encode <source> out.ac4 <kbps> <options>`, or
`out.mp4` for MP4, since `ac4-encode` writes the MP4 file itself. Run where the source is, it
writes the same bytes the page writes; the Qt Quick Tests hold a raw stream, an MP4 file and a
5.1 downmix to that. The page and the command share their channel order, loudness measurement
and packaging (`apps/common/ac4_encode_core.hpp`).

`aspx-acpl-1` is on the Codec mode list, but `ac4-encode` takes it only with `experimental=acpl`,
which the page never sets, so choosing it ends in the encoder's refusal.

What the tab leaves to the command line: several substreams and presentations, dialogue stems
and hybrid dialogue enhancement, a DRC profile per decoder mode, Lt/Rt's own mix levels, the LFE
mix and the downmix corrections, I-frames at named frames or fragment starts, the syntax trace,
the `experimental=` tools, the codec modes of the immersive layouts (`scpl`, `aspx-scpl`,
`aspx-ajcc`), the height downmix, and the 3.0, 7.X and immersive layouts (5.0.4 and 5.1.4 among
them). None of these fits one source in one layout, and each is
an option of [`forge ac4-encode`](../cli/commands.md#ac4-encode). Objects are the Objects tab's:
with its switch on and AC-4 the codec, the page writes AC-4 objects, and the AC-4 tab carries what
an object stream takes; see [Objects & motion](objects-and-motion.md#ac-4-objects).

- [Multi-source & assignment](source-assignment.md) — the table everything above derives from.
- [Coding tools](coding-tools.md) — the Annex E tools, in Expert's tab bar for AC-3 and E-AC-3;
  the tools apply to E-AC-3 only.
- [Metadata](metadata.md) — the rest of the loudness/downmix picture, Expert only and not for
  AC-4.
