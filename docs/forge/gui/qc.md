# QC a stream

The same verification `forge qc` runs on the command line, reachable from the window itself.
Everything else in this guide configures and runs an **encode** — a source loaded, a plan built,
Encode writing a new file. QC is the opposite shape: an **already-encoded** `.ac3`, `.ec3` or
`.ac4` file is opened, decoded and measured against its own embedded `dialnorm` (and `compr`, for
AC-3 and E-AC-3), with no source, no plan and no encoder involved. That's why it lives as its own dialog rather than a tab — opened from a
**QC a stream…** button in the header beside **Preferences**, the same "distinct surface,
reachable from the header" shape [Preferences](index.md#preferences) and a run chip's own details
popover use.

## Opening it

**QC a stream…**, top right, next to Preferences and the Guided/Advanced/Expert control. It opens
regardless of what (if anything) is loaded in the main workbench — QC-ing a finished file has
nothing to do with whatever source is currently being configured for a new encode, and the two
never interact.

**Choose file…** opens a standard file picker with four filters — `*.ac3`/`*.ec3`, `*.ac4`,
**Containers** (`*.mkv *.webm *.mp4 *.m4a *.mov *.ts *.m2ts`) and **All files**. The filters are a
convenience for the picker only: `QcController` sniffs the actual bytes rather than trusting the
extension, so a container works whatever the name says.
Picking one starts the measurement immediately, the same way `forge qc <file>` runs the moment
it is invoked — there is no separate "Run" step. A long file measures off the window's own event
loop (the same background-worker pattern every encode in this app already uses), so the dialog
stays responsive and shows a spinner beside the path while it works.

## The report

Once a file has been measured, the dialog fills with:

- **A summary line** — codec, layout, sample rate, unit count and duration, `forge qc`'s own
  opening line restated (`AC-3 · 5.1 · 48000 Hz · 500 frame(s) · 16.00 s`).
- **One card per programme** — one, except for a `1+1` dual-mono stream, which reports Ch1 and
  Ch2 independently (§E1.3: two unrelated programmes sharing a syncframe, never averaged
  together — the same split the dual-mono rail row and Metadata tab already draw). Each card
  carries:
    - **Three meters** — integrated loudness, loudness range and true peak, drawn as a filled bar
      against a fixed scale rather than a bare number, the same "value on a track" shape
      [`ChannelMeter`](loading-a-source.md#02-levels) uses for the workbench's own channel levels.
      With a single delivery preset selected (see below), the loudness meter also draws a shaded
      **tolerance band** around that preset's target and the true-peak meter a **ceiling line** at
      its limit — the value's own fill turns from neutral to the app's accent colour exactly when
      it falls outside the band or crosses the ceiling, the same two-state colouring the channel
      meters' own CLIP indicator uses. Loudness range has no preset gate (none of the five named
      presets define one), so its meter always reads as a plain measurement.
    - **A dialnorm check** — the stream's own `dialnorm` restated as the LKFS it claims
      (`§5.4.2.8`: dialnorm is how far dialogue sits below digital 100%), the measured-minus-claimed
      delta, and what dialnorm the measurement itself would imply — exactly the three lines
      `forge qc` prints under "dialnorm check", plus `compr` (§5.4.2.9/§7.7.2) when the stream
      carries one.
    - **A verdict row per delivery preset** — EBU R 128 s2, ATSC A/85, ATSC A/85 streaming,
      Netflix and Apple Music Atmos (the same five `iclforge::ac3::meta::kQcPresetIds` names, each preset's
      target/tolerance/ceiling cited from its own primary source — see `qc.hpp`'s own comment for
      the exact clauses), each showing its own loudness PASS/FAIL, true-peak PASS/FAIL and an
      overall chip. `QcController::programmes()` iterates the whole table, so this list grows with
      it rather than with a count repeated here.

## Delivery preset

A segmented control — **All presets**, **EBU R 128 s2**, **ATSC A/85**, **ATSC A/85 streaming**,
**Netflix** and **Apple Music Atmos** — mirrors `forge qc`'s own `preset=<name>|all` argument. It
is built from `QcController.presetNames`, "All presets" and then `kQcPresetIds` in order, so a
preset added to that table reaches it without a change to the dialog:

- **All presets** (the default) lists every preset's own verdict, with no single target/ceiling to
  draw as a line on the meters above (five different presets would mean five different bands on
  the same bar) — the meters show plain measured values, and the report becomes a compact
  overview of where the stream sits against all five deliveries at once.
- Choosing **one** preset narrows the verdict list to it and feeds that preset's own numbers into
  the meters as the tolerance band / ceiling line, so the report can show exactly *why* a gate
  passed or failed rather than only *that* it did.

## AC-4

An AC-4 file, raw (`*.ac4`, which has a filter of its own) or in an MP4, is recognised by its sync
word and measured the way `forge qc` measures one: the presentation decoded as the stream codes
it, with no output level and so no DRC, dialogue enhancement or downmix, metered over its 1/0,
2/0, 3/0 or 3/2 bed (a 7.X element's last pair left out). The card's dialnorm check reads AC-4's
dialnorm, in quarter-dB steps (ETSI TS 103 190-1 clause 4.3.12.2.1), and adds the integrated
loudness the stream states in its further loudness information where it sends one; AC-4 has no
`compr`, so that line is left out. A stream that decodes at 96 or 192 kHz (an HSF extension, Part 1
clause 4.2.4.3) is refused by name, for the meter's K-weighting is made for 44.1 and 48 kHz.

A **Presentation** picker appears for an AC-4 file. Its first entry is the decoder's own choice
with no preference, `forge qc`'s default; the others are the table of contents' presentations
by position, each labelled with its channels as coded, its language and its `presentation_id`
where the stream sends them, and picking one measures that presentation, as
`forge qc presentation=<n>` does. Opening another file starts at the decoder's choice again.

## What it does not do

This reads a stream that already exists; it has no connection to the workbench's own encode
plan or the loaded source. QC-ing the file a run just produced no longer needs the file picker,
though: a finished run's own chip carries a **More…** menu with **QC this run**, opening this
dialog with that run's output already chosen — see [Open stream](open-stream.md#from-a-finished-run).
