# Window layout

`forge-gui` is Forge's graphical interface. It uses a two-pane workbench for sources, codec
settings, objects, metadata, and results. The equivalent [`forge`](../cli/index.md) command is
shown at the bottom of the window.

The screenshots use the current workbench in the default Signal light theme. Theme and text-size
settings are covered under [Preferences](#preferences). See [Install Forge](../index.md#installing)
for packages and source-build instructions.

## First run

Until a source has ever been chosen, the window shows a first-run screen instead of the workbench
— three ways in (a WAV file, a capture device, or a bundled 5.1 test signal the app synthesises
on the spot) and a one-sentence tour of the window:

![The first-run screen](screenshots/firstrun.png)

Any of those, plus dragging a file onto the window or launching `forge-gui path/to/file` from a
shell, works from the first-run screen or the workbench alike — a WAV becomes a source, an
already-encoded `.ac3`/`.ec3` opens in the [stream player](open-stream.md) instead. An `.ac4` file
is not recognised there: dropped or named on the command line it is read as a source and refused,
so open one with **Open stream…**, whose file picker has an AC-4 filter. `forge-gui` claims no file
type with the desktop, so a double-click in the file manager does not reach it:

- On Linux `forge-gui.desktop` has no `MimeType=` line, and the `forge-gui-mime.xml` fragment the package
  installs only declares the `audio/ac3` and `audio/eac3` types with their `*.ac3` and `*.ec3`
  globs.
- On macOS `Info.plist` carries no document types.
- The Windows installer points `.ac3` and `.ec3` at [Hearth](../../hearth/index.md), the desktop
  player, and at `forge-gui.exe` only in a package built without Hearth (the one case where a
  double-click does start `forge-gui`).
- Hearth is the registered opener for `.ac3` and `.ec3` on all three; no platform registers `.ac4`.

See [Loading a source](loading-a-source.md#01-input).

## The window

Minimum size 1280×900. Two panes, divided by a vertical rule:

![The workbench: a 5.1 source loaded, Advanced tier](screenshots/overview-default.png)

- **Header** (top): the `iclforge` wordmark and subtitle, a **Guided / Advanced / Expert**
  segmented control, a **QC a stream…** button (a separate dialog that measures an
  already-encoded file — see [QC a stream](qc.md)), an **Inspect objects…** button (its decode-side
  counterpart for Dolby Atmos object metadata/audio — see [Inspect objects](inspect-objects.md)),
  an **Open stream…** button (plays an already-encoded file and exports its decode — see
  [Open stream](open-stream.md)), a **Preferences** button, and an **About** button (the version
  and the licence).
- **Left rail — "the signal"** (always visible, never scrolled away, and never affected by which
  tier is selected): three numbered blocks — **01 Input** (one input, with a **File / Live
  capture** selector, the loaded source list and its totals), **02 Levels** (the channel meters),
  and **03 Soundfield** (the plan views). This is what's coming *in* — see
  [Loading a source](loading-a-source.md).
- **Right panel — "the stream"**: a plan strip showing the derived output headline
  (`<codec> · <shape> · <bitrate> kbps · .<suffix>`, or `quality <n>` in VBR mode, or
  `5.1 bed + <n> objects` in E-AC-3's object mode, `<n> objects` in AC-4's), a sub-line counting
  speakers, coded channels and dependent substreams, and the Annex E tools token on a chip.
  Beneath it, a tab bar (hidden in Guided, which fills the panel with its own steps) — tabs carry
  a badge counting their non-default settings, so a collapsed panel still declares itself.
- **Run strip** (bottom): past and in-flight runs — file encodes, recordings, and live sessions
  alike — each a compact **`forge` command-line chip**, beside the primary Encode button.
    - Encode runs in-process, so the command line is reference material: click a chip to open a
      popover with the complete live-generated line (wrapped, with Copy). It's present in every
      tier, including Guided, since a codec developer should always be one click from the
      equivalent command.
    - The line is complete: extra sources ride as `src=`, the assignment as `map=`, non-default
      metadata in `print_meta_usage`'s own grammar, AC-3's bare `couple`, quoting where names
      carry spaces. A live source renders as the single `live` subcommand, even with Matroska
      selected (`container=mkv`) — see [Live capture & session](live-session.md). A *file*
      encode's Matroska container is *two* commands instead (`… && forge mkv …`), since pasting
      one command would write a raw elementary stream into a file named `.mkv`.
    - Finished chips carry **Show in folder** and **Play** — the latter sends the run's own
      output to a receiver over the same IEC 61937 passthrough path Format's own Passthrough
      section uses (see [Format & channels](format-and-channels.md#loudness-and-passthrough)),
      greyed out when nothing here can bitstream what that run actually produced. A run from
      Guided's **Play it on my receiver** destination (step 5) carries its auto-picked device
      along, so Play needs no fresh pick. Play is an AC-3 and E-AC-3 action: no receiver takes
      AC-4 over IEC 61937 and the GUI has no path for it, so on a finished AC-4 run the button is
      enabled by the device's AC-3 support and pressing it ends in an error status, the file being
      no AC-3 or E-AC-3 stream.
    - Clicking a chip's summary text (the text is the click target, not the status square or
      padding) opens that run's details popover: status, rate, duration, size, frame count, the
      failure text if it failed, and the exact `forge` command line as it stood *when that run
      started* — snapshotted, not read live, so an old chip's popover stays accurate even after
      the command bar above has moved on.
    - Failed and cancelled chips say which they are in the chip text itself, with a frame count
      and a distinct square. A failure's banner names the cause first and offers **Choose another
      device** / **Retry as file**; a refusal that never opened a run (an incomplete assignment,
      the sixteen-object cap) lands in the same banner rather than only a status line.
    - The last thirty finished runs persist across a restart, restored alongside the "reopen the
      last session's sources" preference below.

## Guided, Advanced, Expert

- **Guided** (the default for a new session) replaces the tabbed right panel with a five-step
  sequence — **Audio**, **Speakers**, **Quality**, **Movement**, **Where it goes** — that reads
  and writes the exact same state Advanced and Expert do. There is no separate "wizard draft":
  switch tiers mid-session and whatever guided set is exactly what Advanced or Expert already
  show for the same field, and vice versa. The step bar and the assistant/Back/**Next** footer
  stay pinned; only the step content scrolls between them, and each new step opens at its own
  top — the way forward is never below the fold.

  ![Guided step 1 — Audio, with "What each sound does"](screenshots/guided-wizard-source.png)

  Guided is not a dead end and not a reduced feature set — every step edits the same state
  Advanced and Expert show, just in plain language:
    - **Step 1 (Audio)** carries its own **What each sound does** list — the same per-channel
      destination dropdowns as the [full assignment table](source-assignment.md), in plain
      language — with a jump to that table and a lossless **Back to guided** return.
    - **Step 2 (Speakers)**'s cards can open a **room picker** sub-screen: say what's *in the
      room* and the channel layout falls out of the parts.
    - **Step 3 (Quality)**'s **Good / Better / Best** cards set a fixed CBR bit rate (192 / 448 /
      768 kbps) normally, or — when a VBR default ([Preferences](#preferences)) or an
      already-selected Variable rate mode applies — a VBR quality target instead (40 / 75 / 90),
      since a fixed bit rate isn't what either of those is asking for.
    - **Step 4 (Movement)**'s cards drive [object mode](objects-and-motion.md), with trajectory
      presets that author real keyframes. Once objects are on, two more cards ask **what should
      move**: *Everything moves* rewrites every loaded channel's assignment to an object (no bed
      left underneath), while *Keep the bed, add movers* leaves an existing mix alone and only
      turns still-unassigned channels (a file added since) into objects. Both edit the same
      [assignment table](source-assignment.md) step 1 shows, so a later hand edit there always
      sticks.
    - **Step 5 (Where it goes)**'s **Play it on my receiver** destination auto-picks the first
      output device that can actually bitstream what's about to be encoded (the same "AC-3 +
      E-AC-3 ready" capability labelling Format's own passthrough picker uses — see [Format &
      channels](format-and-channels.md#loudness-and-passthrough)), with a **Choose a different
      device →** link to override it and a stated reason when nothing qualifies. Encoding writes
      straight to the planned filename (no save dialog, since the destination is the receiver),
      and the finished run's own **Play** action reuses that same device.

  Constraints are explained rather than hidden throughout — turning movement on says it fixed the
  bed at 5.1, rather than silently locking controls elsewhere.
- **Advanced** shows a tabbed right panel — [Format](format-and-channels.md) (presets, the
  channel picker, routing, the assignment table, a Loudness section) and
  [Objects](objects-and-motion.md).
- **Expert** adds the [Coding tools](coding-tools.md) and [Metadata](metadata.md) tabs (Metadata
  absorbs the Loudness section, so it appears exactly once). With AC-4 chosen as the codec, an
  [AC-4](format-and-channels.md#ac-4) tab takes their place, in Advanced as well as Expert; Guided
  has no AC-4 tab. [Live session](live-session.md)
  joins the tab bar in Advanced and Expert whenever the live source is selected in the rail —
  sessions running or not — and carries a `live` badge while one runs.

Switching tiers never discards anything already set — it only changes what's visible (and, for
Guided, how it's presented: one question at a time instead of a page of controls). Leaving Expert
while a tab only it shows is current falls back to Format rather than showing an empty panel.

## The loudness contract

The app's own defaults are spec-neutral — dialnorm 31, no DRC, no measurement — the same values a
plan carries if nothing here ever touched it. Guided, while it is driving, layers a stronger
default on top: measured loudness and film-standard DRC, applied automatically once the flow
reaches its "What you are about to make" summary, so the summary already tells the truth before
Encode is ever pressed. This never overwrites an actual edit — the moment Loudness/Metadata is set
by hand (in Guided itself, or in Advanced/Expert during the same session), the contract steps aside
for good, this session, and dialnorm/DRC stay exactly what was set.

Dual mono (`1+1`) gets the same contract, applied to each of its two programmes independently —
see [Dual mono](format-and-channels.md#dual-mono) for why nothing is shared between them.

## Preferences

A real dialog, persisted across sessions (QSettings), three columns:

- **Appearance**
    - Theme (Light / Dark / System) and **Text size** (100% / 125% / 150% / 175% / System, the
      same five Crucible offers — every size in the window is a multiple of it; see [Keyboard &
      text size](accessibility.md#text-size) for which panels still hold a fixed height).
    - The **palette** (Signal / Ink / Console / System — the last follows the desktop's accent
      colour where the platform exposes one).
    - **Language** (System / English / Français / Deutsch / Español / العربية / עברית / יידיש),
      switching live with no restart. Arabic, Hebrew and Yiddish also mirror the whole window
      right-to-left and switch to a bundled Noto Sans face, since Archivo has no glyph coverage
      for either script — see [Localisation](localisation.md) for what's translated today.
    - Which meter rows to show by default ([Coded / Rendered](loading-a-source.md#02-levels)).
    - **Explanations** — show the plain-language notes beside controls, and optionally warn
      before a choice changes the codec (the codec follows the channels either way; the warning
      only makes the moment deliberate).
- **When ICL Forge opens**
    - The Controls tier (including "whatever I used last"); reopen the last session's sources
      and assignments (saved as one unit on close, restored on open — a file gone missing fails
      its load with the usual message rather than aborting the rest); optionally start on the
      last screen.
    - **Files and runs** — the output folder ("beside the first source" by default), the
      `{source}.{ext}` naming pattern every save dialog and auto-named take follows, and
      keep-partial-output: a failed or cancelled run's frames land beside the intended output as
      `<name>.partial.<ext>`, named and kept, never silently discarded.
- **Defaults for a new encode**
    - Container, rate mode, bit rate, VBR quality, DRC profile, measure loudness. The codec is
      deliberately **not** a default — it follows the channels (see [Format &
      channels](format-and-channels.md)), and a stale default would contradict that.
    - Clicking **Save** applies a changed default to whichever of these fields nothing has
      explicitly touched *this session* yet — the same contract [the loudness
      contract](#the-loudness-contract) already gives DRC profile and measure loudness,
      generalised to container/rate mode/bit rate/VBR quality too. An edit made before Save is
      never clobbered: touch a field once (Guided, Advanced or Expert, any of them count) and
      Preferences stops overwriting it for the rest of the session.
    - **Capture** — start monitoring as soon as a device is chosen, and whether Record asks for a
      filename or writes straight to the output folder under a timestamped take name.
    - **Command line** — keep the `forge` line visible.
    - **Diagnostics** — **Save diagnostics…** writes a plain-text file for a bug report: the
      versions, the platform, what is loaded, the settings in force and the last messages the
      window logged. It carries no audio, no part of any file you loaded and no signing key,
      it's written where you choose, and nothing is sent anywhere — see [Saving a diagnostics
      file](accessibility.md#saving-a-diagnostics-file).

## Next

The rest of the guide, in reading order:

1. [Loading a source](loading-a-source.md) — pick a WAV (or several), or capture live; watch the
   channel meters
2. [Format & channels](format-and-channels.md) — layout, dual mono, VBR, bit rate, container —
   and the assignment table everything else derives from
3. [Objects & motion](objects-and-motion.md) — Dolby Atmos objects
4. [Live capture & session](live-session.md) — capture → encode → monitor/passthrough, live
5. [Multi-source & assignment](source-assignment.md) — several sources at once, each channel
   individually assigned to a bed position, an object, or a dual-mono programme
6. [Coding tools](coding-tools.md) — Annex E tools (Expert; the tools apply to E-AC-3 only, and
   under AC-3 the tab shows an explainer instead)
7. [Metadata](metadata.md) — loudness, downmix, heavy compression (Expert)
8. [QC a stream](qc.md) — measure an already-encoded file against its own metadata, from the
   header's own dialog
9. [Inspect objects](inspect-objects.md) — see the Dolby Atmos object positions and audio a decoder
   actually recovers from an already-encoded file, from the header's own dialog
10. [Open stream](open-stream.md) — play an already-encoded file and export its decode, from the
    header's own dialog or a finished run's own **More…** menu
11. [Localisation](localisation.md) — what's translated today, the pseudo-locale QA fixture, and
    how to update or add a language
12. [Keyboard & text size](accessibility.md) — what can be done without a mouse, what a screen
    reader is told, the text-size setting, the diagnostics file, and what is still mouse-only

Or start with [Concepts](../../concepts/index.md) if terms like "dependent substream" or "JOC" are
unfamiliar — the GUI uses the same vocabulary as the standards it implements.
