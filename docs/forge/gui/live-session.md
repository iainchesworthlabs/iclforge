# Live capture & session

## Starting a capture

The rail's [Input block](loading-a-source.md#01-input), switched to **Live capture**, is where
devices get chosen (up to two, see [Two-device capture](#two-device-capture-clock-master-model)
below) and where the two signal-side acts live: **Monitor** (a session that writes nothing and
asks for no filename — the meters and soundfield run against the real encoded signal, and checking
a device never commits to a take) and **Record…** (capture straight to a file). Both act on the
master device alone, the same as a single-device session. The rail keeps nothing else: a *real*
session — one with a take on disk or a receiver leg — starts on the **Live session** tab's own
**Live session** Card.

The Card has two states:

- **Idle — the pre-flight.** A **Receiver** combo (`No passthrough` plus every enumerated output
  device), a **Monitor** checkbox (checked by default), an **Also write the take to disk**
  checkbox, a **Raw-WAV safety copy** checkbox (enabled only once write-to-disk is checked — see
  [Take durability](#take-durability) below), and a highlighted **Start session** button, enabled
  whenever capture is available and nothing else is running. Checking write-to-disk makes Start
  session ask for a save path first, and the session starts once the dialog closes; unchecked, the
  session starts immediately and writes nothing.
- **Running — the transport.** A **Stop session** button, zero-padded RUNNING / FRAMES / DROPPED
  counters, and a disabled **Also writing the take to disk** readout, since that choice is made
  pre-flight and can't change mid-session.

button](screenshots/live-session-idle.png)

Starting a *real* session — a take on disk or a receiver leg wanted — focuses the tab; Monitor,
however it is started, never steals the tab you are configuring.

### The VBR warning

[Rate mode](format-and-channels.md#rate-mode-constant-or-variable) lives on the Format tab,
shared with plain file encoding — and it does not render at all while the live source is
selected: a live session cannot honour it, so the control would only mislead. A VBR choice made
earlier still exists, so the **Live session** tab's own Card carries a note in its idle state
whenever VBR is on:

![The live-session VBR warning, now on the Live session tab's own
card](screenshots/live-session-vbr-note.png)

A live session always runs at the fixed bit rate, regardless of the rate mode: IEC 61937
passthrough bursts are fixed-size per access unit, and nothing renegotiates burst framing
mid-stream, so the VBR setting is dropped unconditionally before a session ever starts. The
run entry a real session opens says so too — its rate text is always the fixed rate.

!!! note "No screenshot of an active session here"
    The idle Card above is a real capture, taken against a running build with a real device
    enumerated on the machine. A session actually *running* is not shown: driving one would mean
    recording live audio through a microphone just to illustrate a UI state, so the running
    transport, the chain strip mid-run, the reconnection banner, and the Live room's live-only
    controls are described from the implementation rather than photographed.

### AC-4

A live session encodes AC-3 or E-AC-3. With AC-4 chosen as the codec on the
[Format tab](format-and-channels.md#ac-4), **Start session** and the rail's **Monitor** both refuse,
with a status line saying a live session encodes AC-3 or E-AC-3, and nothing starts; pick one of
those codecs first. The command line goes further here: `forge live` takes `codec=ac4` (mono,
stereo, 5.0 or 5.1), monitors the AC-4 it encodes and hands a receiver the parallel 5.1 AC-3 leg,
since no receiver found takes AC-4 over IEC 61937 — see
[CLI → Commands → Live & hardware](../cli/commands.md#live-hardware). The GUI has no AC-4 live
path, and the rail's **Record…** has no AC-4 encoder behind it either (it builds the AC-3 and
E-AC-3 encoders only); record an AC-4 take with `forge record … codec=ac4`.

## Two-device capture: clock-master model

A session is capped at **two** capture devices. The rail's live branch is a per-device list,
mirroring the file branch's own per-source list: one row per selected device — name,
`N ch · 48 000 Hz`, **Remove** — plus **Add input…** (disabled at the cap, with a "two devices
per session" note) and a totals line (`2 devices · 4 channels captured`). The first row is always
the **master**; the second, when present, the **slave**.

**Clock model.** The master's delivery paces the session's frame loop exactly as in a
single-device session. The slave is an independent capture, and there is no shared hardware
clock between two WASAPI shared-mode endpoints, even nominally identical ones on the same PC:
left alone, the slave's stream drifts against the master's a sample at a time. Two small,
Qt-free, allocation-free library pieces (`libs/audio/include/iclforge/audio/resampler.hpp`) correct
that:

- **`iclforge::audio::DriftResampler`** — a streaming linear-interpolation fractional resampler.
  Linear interpolation, not a windowed-sinc design: at the drift magnitudes a free-running consumer
  clock actually exhibits (tens of parts-per-million) linear interpolation's error sits far below
  the codec's psychoacoustic floor, and at a nominal-rate conversion (44.1 → 48 kHz) it
  trades some high-frequency accuracy near Nyquist for an allocation-free, state-tiny
  implementation appropriate to a live capture hot path. It carries only a fractional read position
  between `render()` calls — no sample data of its own.
- **`iclforge::audio::ClockDriftEstimator`** — the servo that decides the resampler's ratio: a small
  proportional controller steering the worker's own slave-side scratch FIFO back towards a target
  occupancy (one frame period's worth), smoothed with a one-pole filter so the ratio moves in
  small, audio-safe steps rather than jumping. `ratio()` is the nominal conversion
  (`master_rate / slave_rate`, 1.0 when both devices run the same nominal rate) composed with the
  measured correction; `drift_ppm()` is that correction alone, signed, zero until the servo has
  seen data.

Each frame period, after the master's own blocking capture-fill completes, the worker opportunistically
drains whatever the slave's ring buffer holds (non-blocking — the master's wait already gave it
roughly one frame period's worth of wall-clock time to deliver), feeds the FIFO's occupancy to the
estimator, and resamples exactly `kSamplesPerFrame` slave frames to sit alongside the master's own.
If the slave's nominal rate differs from the master's, the same resampler handles the nominal
conversion and the drift correction together — one ratio, composed once per frame period.

**Drift visibility.** The Live session tab's chain capture cell shows the slave's *measured*
correction — `slave −18 ppm` — updated with the same ~30 Hz cadence as every other live stat,
empty (and the line hidden) outside a two-device session. Measured, not estimated ahead of time:
it is the correction the resampler is actually applying.

**Channel space.** The flat capture-channel space object slots address gains the slave's channels
after the master's — devices are sources, the same identity concept loaded files carry. The Live
room's channel picker names each flat index (`Ch 1`… for the master, `Dev2 Ch 1`… for the slave),
and per-slot bind/reassign (see [Objects & motion](objects-and-motion.md)) works the same across
both devices — a slot simply addresses a wider space. A **plain channel-mode session's bed still
comes from the master alone**: the routing's panning model treats a source's channel *count* as a
specific named WAV speaker layout (§7.8), which has no sound meaning for two independent devices
concatenated together, so there is no principled default position to auto-pan the slave's
channels into. The slave's audio is still captured, drift-corrected, watched by its own silence
watchdog and reflected in the drift readout either way — just not auto-routed into a bed position
with no defensible default.

**Session plumbing.** The second device is the rail's own selection state, not part of any one
start request, so it persists across [a layout-switcher
restart](#switching-layout-mid-session) automatically. A bad or vanished slave (unplugged between
selection and start) degrades non-fatally to an ordinary single-device session, the same
low-ceremony treatment a failed monitor-sink open gets. The silence watchdog covers **each**
device independently: either going silent for three seconds fails the session, and the failure
text names the one that actually went quiet.

**CLI parity.** `forge live` takes a trailing `capture2=<index>` token naming the second device,
built on the same shared resampler and drift estimator — see
[CLI → Options & grammars](../cli/metadata-options.md#capture2) for its grammar.
The GUI's own command bar emits it whenever the rail has two devices selected, so the line stays
accurate.

## The Live session tab

The **Live session** tab exists whenever the live source is selected in the rail (Advanced and
Expert) — it is where a session is *understood*, not a modal that only appears once one is
already underway. It carries:

- A reconnection banner while the receiver re-locks to a new bitstream format — named after the
  actual endpoint (*"Renegotiating with Denon AVR-X3800H."*), because the session knows exactly
  who is re-locking. This fires for a session's own first passthrough open and for a
  [receiver hot-swap](#receiver-hot-swap) alike — either way about a second of audio is lost, and
  the banner says so rather than hiding the dropout; a **Skip** dismisses it early for whoever can
  hear the receiver has already settled.
- The transport row described above: Stop session, RUNNING/FRAMES/DROPPED, and the disabled
  write-to-disk readout.
- A "chain" strip showing the three legs as separate plans: **Capture** (the actual device, with
  its `2 ch · 48 000 Hz` sub-line) → **Live encode** (follows the picker — what the meters and
  soundfield show, printed without a file suffix a session may never write) → **Receiver leg —
  IEC 61937** (with the burst data type it is actually sending).
- A gap banner when the receiver leg carries less than the encode, naming whichever of three
  reasons applies:
    - object mode against an E-AC-3-capable receiver — the leg is always just the 5.1 bed, since a
      consumer decoder gates object decoding regardless of what the receiver can bitstream;
    - object mode against an AC-3-only receiver — the leg is the [parallel
      downmix](#parallel-downmix-receiver-leg) of that same bed;
    - a wide channel layout against an AC-3-only receiver — the leg is a 5.1 downmix of the full
      layout.

  A passthrough that was asked for and did *not open* gets its own banner instead, carrying the
  reason — "everything past what the leg carries" would be a lie when the leg carries nothing.
- A draggable **Live room** plan — the same object-placement view as
  [Objects & motion](objects-and-motion.md) with its crosshair and wall names, active only in
  Atmos mode, applying each drag to the running encode immediately — plus a read-only **Objects
  in this session** chip list.
    - **The slot budget.** A live Atmos session pre-allocates a fixed *budget* of object slots at
      start — the combined capture channel count of both selected devices, held to at least 8 and
      at most 15 — baked into the encoder's construction and unable to change mid-session (that's
      how JOC's own object count works). A two-channel device still gets eight slots to grow into;
      past eight combined channels, every slot starts bound identity-wise (slot *i* fed by capture
      channel *i*).
    - **Binding.** Which capture channel feeds which slot is otherwise live and mutable: a
      channel-picker ComboBox names every capture channel (`Ch 1`…`Ch N` for the master, `Dev2 Ch
      1`… for a selected slave — see
      [Two-device capture](#two-device-capture-clock-master-model)), and **Add** (binds the next
      free slot), **Reassign selected** (acts on whichever object the room has selected) and
      **Silence selected** (detaches the selected object's capture channel) sit on the Card,
      visible only while live.
    - **The counter.** **OBJECTS IN THIS SESSION** reads `N of M slots live` (bound slots over the
      budget) while a session is running, and plain `N objects live` in the non-live, file-loaded
      object-mode case.
    - **Latency.** Beside the room, an x/y/z/latency readout grid tracks whichever object is
      selected. Latency starts as a two-frame estimate (one period to fill the capture buffer, one
      to encode and hand off), then — once monitoring has run for about a second and the
      pipeline's startup transients have passed — is replaced by the real measured
      capture-to-monitor round trip: the label reads `~N ms measured` once that lands, and `~N ms
      est.` until then or whenever monitoring is off, since there's nothing to time a round trip
      against.
- A **Layout** switcher and a receiver-reports card (see below). The same **Receiver** combo above
  the Card serves both phases of a session: before Start it is the pre-flight pick; once live, an
  explicit choice hot-swaps the passthrough leg instead of restarting anything — see
  [Receiver hot-swap](#receiver-hot-swap). The reports card leads with two receiver-display
  rows — **Format** and **Input** — above Lock, Underruns and Monitor. Both read the
  ACTUAL leg on the wire, not the main plan: `DOLBY DIGITAL PLUS`/the full shape when the receiver
  takes the main format, or `DOLBY DIGITAL`/`5.1` whenever the
  [parallel downmix leg](#parallel-downmix-receiver-leg) is the one actually carrying the signal.

Real sessions also land in the [run history](format-and-channels.md): a take or a receiver leg
opens a run entry (duration `live`), so a mid-session failure — including the device-drop
watchdog's own, see [Device-drop detection](#device-drop-detection) — has a chip and a banner to
land on, and a finished take has a **Show in folder**. Monitor-only checks deliberately stay out
of the history, watchdog failures included: only a take on disk or a receiver leg opens the entry
in the first place.

## Live position input over OSC

Object mode's pre-flight card (the same idle Card [Starting a capture](#starting-a-capture)
describes above, visible only while `atmosEnabled` — a channel session has no objects to drive)
carries three more controls: a **Drive objects from OSC** checkbox, a **port** field (default
9000), and an **any interface** checkbox, off by default — loopback only, the same security
posture as the CLI's `local`/`any` split (see [CLI → Commands → Live &
hardware](../cli/commands.md#live-hardware) for why that default matters and the full OSC address
space). All three are pre-flight-only, exactly like **Also write the take to disk** and **Raw-WAV
safety copy** on the same Card: **Start session** reads them once, and they are fixed for that
session's lifetime — toggling the checkbox mid-session does nothing until the *next* session
starts.

Once a session with OSC on is running:

- The transport row (Stop session, RUNNING/FRAMES/DROPPED) gains an **OSC** counter reading
  `N updates, N dropped`.
- In the Live room, an object a live OSC update currently owns is drawn greyed out and stops
  responding to drag — a click or drag there is refused outright rather than fought over — and its
  marker instead tracks whatever the network feed most recently sent. An object nothing has
  addressed is still an ordinary, draggable, manually-placed object exactly as before this feature
  existed, so one session can freely mix network-driven and manually-placed objects.
- `/object/<n>/release` from the network side hands that object back to manual control — its
  marker un-greys and starts responding to drag again.

!!! note "No screenshot of OSC-driven markers here"
    The same reasoning as [the running transport's own note](#starting-a-capture) applies: showing
    a network-driven marker mid-session would mean recording actual network traffic into a
    screenshot just to illustrate a UI state, so the grey-and-undraggable marker behaviour is
    described from the implementation rather than photographed.

This page's job is the GUI controls; the wire protocol behind them — the `positions=` grammar, the
`/object/<n>/xyz|gain|lfe|release` address space, and the loopback-vs-any-interface security
note — is identical on both front ends and documented once, on the CLI side: see
[CLI → Commands → Live & hardware](../cli/commands.md#live-hardware).

## Take durability

A live session writes each encoded unit to disk as it is produced — never accumulating the whole
take in memory to write once at the end, which would make an hour-long session unbounded memory
and a crash lose everything captured.

The output file opens — or, for fragmented MP4/CMAF, the output folder is created — before the
session is marked live, so a bad destination path is refused up front exactly like a bad device
choice, not discovered as a mid-take failure minutes in.

What "writing incrementally" means depends on the container, but each writes straight into the
chosen destination — there is no separate spool file for any of them:

- **Elementary stream** (`.ac3` / `.ec3`): every byte written *is* the take, from the first frame
  on — a crash leaves exactly what was captured, playable up to that point.
- **Matroska** (`.mkv`): batch muxing needs the whole frame list to compute anything, which a
  live session never has until it decides to stop — so this container instead pushes each unit
  into an incremental Matroska writer (`iclforge::containers::matroska::Writer`, `libs/containers/src/matroska`) built for exactly this
  case. Segment is written with EBML's reserved "unknown size" pattern, the standard way a
  streamed Matroska declares a length it cannot know yet, and Duration is omitted for the same
  reason — real players handle both the way they handle any other live-streamed Matroska. The
  writer hands back a just-closed cluster's bytes on the (roughly one-per-second) pushes where
  the time budget closes one, and nothing otherwise, so the session never holds more than one
  cluster's worth of audio in memory regardless of how long it runs. A clean stop flushes the
  trailing partial cluster; nothing else needs closing, since Segment's size was never written as
  a real number to begin with. A crash truncates the take — whatever clusters had already reached
  disk are complete, valid Matroska, so the `.mkv` itself plays up to that point: the same
  "playable up to where it stopped" guarantee the elementary-stream path gives, not a companion
  file to fold in by hand afterward.
- **Fragmented MP4/CMAF**: a folder, not a file, and the only container here whose *manifests*
  change as the take runs. Each unit goes into `iclforge::containers::mp4::FragmentWriter` (`libs/containers/src/mp4`), the incremental
  fragmenter built for exactly this case, which hands back a complete CMAF media segment every
  time a fragment closes (48 access units, about 1.5 s); that segment is written as
  `segment<N>.m4s` and `audio.m3u8`/`master.m3u8`/`manifest.mpd` are rewritten beside it. While
  the session is running they are live-shaped — no `#EXT-X-ENDLIST`, and a `type="dynamic"` MPD
  with an `availabilityStartTime` — so the folder is a servable origin mid-take; Stop flushes the
  trailing partial fragment and closes both to their VOD/static forms. `init.mp4` is written at
  the *first* frame rather than at Start, because its `dac3`/`dec3` box is read off the bitstream
  and there is no bitstream to read before then; the folder itself is still created (and refused
  if it cannot be) before the session goes live. Only one fragment's frames are ever held, so
  memory stays bounded for a session of any length. A crash mid-take leaves every already-written
  segment complete and a playlist listing the ones that had closed — the same "playable up to
  where it stopped" guarantee, one segment coarser.

The two file-based paths flush to disk roughly once a second (not per frame) rather than on
every write; the fragmented-MP4 folder has no long-lived stream to flush, since each segment and
manifest is a complete file written and closed as it is produced.

The Container combo's other three choices — S/PDIF, MP4, MPEG-TS — fall into the
elementary-stream path above during a live session, not their own. For MP4 that is a format
limit: `moov`/`stco` need every frame's final offset, so there is nothing to push a live unit
into. S/PDIF and MPEG-TS both *do* have streaming writers, and a *recording* — the Record
button's capture-to-file take — uses them through `RecordingSink`; `forge live` reaches them too,
with `container=spdif` and `container=ts`. The gap is on this side:
`EncoderController::openLiveOutputWriters` special-cases exactly two incremental writers,
`iclforge::containers::matroska::Writer` and `iclforge::containers::mp4::FragmentWriter`, and everything else falls through to the plain
write. So a live session with one of those three selected keeps writing the plain stream, exactly
the file it would write with the combo left on Elementary stream; the container only changes what
a *file* encode wraps it as afterward (see
[Container](format-and-channels.md#presets-codec-bit-rate-container)).

There is also an optional **raw-WAV safety copy**: the pre-flight "Raw-WAV safety copy" checkbox
is only consulted once the take is also being written to disk. When on, it streams the raw
captured PCM — device channel order, unencoded, before any routing or mixing — to a sibling
`.raw.wav` file (beside a fragmented-MP4 folder, not inside it: the safety copy is source audio,
not part of the CMAF asset a packager would be pointed at) through a streaming WAV writer (`iclforge::ac3::io::WavStreamWriter`) that appends
interleaved samples as they arrive and, like the take itself, periodically re-patches its RIFF
header rather than only at close. Without that, a process kill mid-session leaves a WAV
whose header still claims zero data bytes even though the file holds real audio — most readers
trust the header's declared size over the file's actual length, so an unpatched header would make a
real partial take *look* empty. Patching it every second or so means the worst a hard crash can do
is undersell the last fraction of a second.

## Device-drop detection

The capture read loop runs a silence watchdog (`iclforge::audio::SilenceWatchdog`) that tracks how
long ago the last read attempt actually delivered audio, with a three-second timeout.

Once that gap passes, the session stops as a failure, not a silent "still running": the status
line and the failure banner name the device —

> "Microphone (Logitech StreamCam)" stopped delivering audio - the capture device may have been
> disconnected. Wrote 212 frames before it went quiet.

— and that wording is what makes the failure banner's **Choose another device** action appear:
the banner treats a failure as device-shaped when its text mentions a device, bitstreaming, or
IEC 61937. For a real session, the run entry lands with status `failed` and its frame count. A
monitor-only session that loses its device still stops and the status line still updates the same
way — it just has no run chip or banner to land on, because monitor-only checks never open a run
entry in the first place.

## Receiver hot-swap

Changing the **Receiver** combo on the Live session tab's own Card — or picking `No passthrough` —
while a session is running does not stop the session. The swap closes whatever passthrough sink
is open and opens a new one for the chosen endpoint, entirely on the session's own worker thread,
between frames, so no two threads ever touch the sink at once. Capture and encode keep running
uninterrupted through the swap — only the receiver leg blinks.

A hot-swap that cannot open (the chosen endpoint refuses the current format) shows the same
refusal text a fresh session's own first passthrough open uses — one open-and-explain path, not
two copies of it. The reconnection banner ("Renegotiating with X… expect a second of silence")
fires exactly as it does for a session's initial passthrough open: a hot-swap is a real
exclusive-mode re-open too, so the same brief interruption applies.

On the Live session tab, the same receiver combo serves both roles — before Start it is the
pre-flight choice; once live, an explicit pick performs the hot-swap.

This is a different act from **switching layout**, below: that still stops the whole session,
applies the preset, and starts a fresh one; a hot-swap never stops anything, and only ever
changes the receiver leg.

## Parallel downmix receiver leg

Passthrough is not all-or-nothing: an AC-3-only receiver during an E-AC-3 or Atmos session is not
left with a bare "cannot bitstream" refusal and a silent amplifier while the encode, meters and
monitor carry on. It gets a **capped leg** instead: a second, independent AC-3 encode running in
the session's worker loop, alongside — never in place of — the main encode.

**When it engages.** Exactly when passthrough is wanted, the main plan needs E-AC-3 (any object
session, or a wide channel layout), and the chosen receiver cannot take E-AC-3 but can take plain
AC-3. A receiver that can take neither format is still a refusal — the leg only ever
turns a receiver limitation into sound, never papers over an actual open failure.

**What it encodes.** The leg carries no separate §7.8 fold-down math of its own: every layout
here (5.1, 7.1, 5.1.4, 7.1.4) is built on a 5.1 bed, and the routing already renders each
bed-position coded channel from the bed layout alone, once per frame for the main encode, using
the plan's own `cmixlev`/`surmixlev` — so a wide session's first six coded channels are already a
self-sufficient 5.1 downmix, and an Atmos session's bed is the same thing for object mode. The
leg simply feeds those already-computed channels to a second AC-3 frame encoder — no separate
fold to get right or keep in sync with the main one. Its bit rate is the main session's own rate
reduced to the nearest legal Table 5.18 rung at or below 640.

**Where it goes.** The leg opens through the same passthrough path a session's initial open and a
[receiver hot-swap](#receiver-hot-swap) share, asking the device for plain AC-3 rather than
whatever the main plan would have asked for, and describing itself distinctly
(`Dolby Digital · 5.1 · <name>`, not the ordinary AC-3-session wording or Atmos's "5.1 bed only"
text). There is still only **one** passthrough sink per session — the leg does not open a second
device, it changes what the existing sink is asked to carry. A hot-swap re-runs the same
capability check between frames: moving to an E-AC-3-capable receiver drops the leg and
bitstreams the main format again; moving to an AC-3-only one spins the leg up.

**Truthful UI.** The chain's receiver cell, the Receiver reports Format/Input rows and the gap
banner all read the *actual* leg rather than the main plan (see
[the Live session tab](#the-live-session-tab) above). The
[layout switcher's](#switching-layout-mid-session) legend says the same thing: a dotted layout is
not a dead end, just capped to the 5.1 downmix rather than bitstreamed as encoded.

## Switching layout mid-session

The **Layout — switching re-locks the receiver** card offers the presets (5.1, 7.1, 5.1.4,
7.1.4) — and the Format tab's own preset buttons do the same thing during a live session, per
the design's interaction table. Picking one *stops the running session, applies the preset, and
starts a new session with the same capture/monitor/receiver choices* — the deliberate
stop-renegotiate-resume the reconnection banner narrates, not a silent switch, and not the lighter
[receiver hot-swap](#receiver-hot-swap) above, which never stops anything at all. The dots and the
legend are derived from the **actual receiver**: against an AC-3-only endpoint, layouts past 5.1
carry the dot and the legend names the device (*"Dotted layouts encode and meter fully — Denon
AVR-X3800H bitstreams Dolby Digital only, so this receiver hears a 5.1 downmix of them."*) — with
the [parallel downmix leg](#parallel-downmix-receiver-leg) in place, a dotted layout is never a
dead end: it still encodes and meters fully, the receiver just hears the capped 5.1 downmix rather
than the layout itself. An E-AC-3-capable receiver bitstreams every layout as encoded, and the
legend says that instead. The switcher refuses two states: object mode (the layout is
fixed at a 5.1 bed — the card says so) and a take being written to disk (a restart would clobber
the first half of the file; stop the session and start a new take instead).

This is the GUI equivalent of `forge live`: capture → encode → optional live monitor and/or
passthrough, running continuously and still writing the file `record` always has. See
[CLI → Commands](../cli/commands.md#live-hardware) for the command-line form, including the
`live mode` distinction between `channels` and `atmos` — the GUI's Atmos-mode live room is that
same `atmos` mode, with the timeline replaced by real-time motion.

**What is now at parity**. `forge record` and `forge live` reach the same
capabilities this page describes, through the same code where the code is shareable:

- **Wide layouts and E-AC-3.** `record` and `live mode=channels` take `layout=` and `codec=`
  (see [CLI → Options & grammars](../cli/metadata-options.md#layout-and-codec)) and place the
  captured channels onto them by direction through the same `plan::route` this page's own
  [layout switcher](#switching-layout-mid-session) drives. Neither is stereo-AC-3-only any more.
- **Container choice**, and **take durability** with it. Both commands take
  `container=raw|mkv|ts|spdif|fmp4` (`cmaf` is an accepted alias for the last; see
  [CLI → Options & grammars](../cli/metadata-options.md#container)) and write through
  `RecordingSink` — literally the same class, moved to `apps/common/` and compiled into both
  front ends — so a CLI take and a GUI take of the same container are the same bytes produced
  the same way, with the same bounded memory and the same
  [mid-session crash safety](#take-durability).
- **[Device-drop detection](#device-drop-detection).** Both take `watchdog=<seconds>` (default 3,
  `0` disables) and stop the session as a failure the first time `iclforge::audio::SilenceWatchdog`
  fires — the same class, the same default, the same rule. `capture2=` gets its own watchdog, so
  a dropped slave is reported as the slave.
- **The live object-slot budget.** `live mode=atmos` takes `objects=<N>` and binds capture
  channels to slots with `map=` (`obj`/`objm`/`none`, the same grammar the Format tab's
  assignment table uses — see [Multi-source & assignment](source-assignment.md)), against a
  budget fixed at session start exactly as **Add object** allocates against one here. A GUI
  assignment is reproducible headlessly.
- **The [parallel downmix leg](#parallel-downmix-receiver-leg).** An AC-3-only receiver during an
  E-AC-3 or object CLI session now hears a capped 5.1 AC-3 encode of the bed the main plan already
  computed, instead of a plain refusal; the file still carries the full stream. `downmix=off`
  restores the refusal.
- **Two-device capture**, as before — `capture2=<index>` (see
  [Two-device capture](#two-device-capture-clock-master-model)) uses the same shared
  `DriftResampler`/`ClockDriftEstimator` pair on both sides.

**What is still GUI-only**: [receiver hot-swap](#receiver-hot-swap) (changing the
passthrough endpoint mid-session), the live latency readout, and every interactive affordance this
page describes — the soundfield view, the chips, the banners. A command line has no mid-session
input, so a hot-swap has nothing to be triggered by; `forge live` resolves its receiver once, at
session start, including whether the downmix leg runs.

**What is CLI-only**: an AC-4 take. `forge record` and `forge live` take `codec=ac4`; the GUI's
live session and Monitor refuse it, and its Record has no AC-4 encoder (see [AC-4](#ac-4) above).

## Next

That's the whole app. Back to [Concepts](../../concepts/index.md) for the standards this all
implements, or [Library](../../library/index.md) to build something with `iclforge::ac3` directly.
