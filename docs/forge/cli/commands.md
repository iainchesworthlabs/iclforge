# Commands

The command list from the usage text, reproduced rather than paraphrased — 44 commands, as
a Windows build without `-DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON` prints them. The two ADM commands read
`UNAVAILABLE HERE` because that flag is off; `spatial` does not, because Windows is the one
platform with a spatial backend. Nothing in the build compares this block against the binary, so
`forge help` on your own build is the authority wherever the two disagree:

## By category

### Synthesis — generate a stream from nothing

No source file needed; useful for smoke-testing a build or a receiver without recording
anything first.

| Command | What it writes |
|---|---|
| `silence` | Silent AC-3 |
| `sine` | A tone, one per speaker, AC-3. Append `c` to `[layout]` (e.g. `stereoc`) to turn on channel coupling. |
| `orbit` | AC-3 with a synthetic panned source circling the room (exercises the [spatial layer](../../library/spatial-and-atmos.md) — plain bed panning, no object metadata) |
| `atmos` | E-AC-3 with synthetic orbiting Atmos objects — a 5.1 bed plus JOC + OAMD side data (TS 103 420) |
| `atmos-path` | Same, but object motion comes from an authored scene file (keyframe columns or JSON) instead of the built-in orbit |

The scene file `atmos-path` reads (and `atmos-encode`'s optional `[paths.txt]`, below) comes in
two forms, told apart by whether its first non-whitespace character is `{` — not by its suffix,
so either works wherever the other does:

- **Keyframe columns**, the original: plain text, one keyframe per line as whitespace-separated
  columns `object_index time_s x y z gain lfe_send`; `#` starts a comment and blank lines are
  skipped. Unchanged, including its diagnostics. It is still what the GUI's timeline exports by
  default — see [GUI → Objects & motion](../gui/objects-and-motion.md).
- **An object scene in JSON**, the `iclforge::objects::oba::ObjectScene` form: named objects, a bed
  assignment, per-segment interpolation (`hold`, `linear`, `smooth`) and a scene orientation,
  none of which the columns have anywhere to put. Documented in
  [Library → Spatial & Atmos](../../library/spatial-and-atmos.md#the-serialised-form); the GUI
  writes it when you save the export under a `.json` name.

Positions are room-anchored per TS 103 420 §4.2.1: `x` runs 0 at the left wall to 1 at the
right, `y` 0 at the front wall to 1 at the back, `z` -1 at the floor to +1 at the ceiling.
Between two cues a value is interpolated (linearly, unless the JSON form says otherwise); before
the first and after the last it *holds*, so an object sits still rather than extrapolating or
going silent. An object index the keyframe file never mentions keeps that command's own default
placement — room centre for `atmos-path`, that channel's fanned-out static position for
`atmos-encode`.

```bash
forge eac3-sine out.ec3 5 384 1000 50 714
```

Five seconds at 50% amplitude, 384 kbps, one tone per coded channel — 14 of them for a 7.1.4
layout, though only 12 reach speakers: the two bed channels the dependent substreams replace
carry tones a full decoder never renders. (The 1000 Hz argument applies only to a one- or
two-channel layout; anything wider gets a distinct spread of per-channel frequencies instead,
so a misrouted channel is identifiable by ear.)

### File encoding — real audio in, a stream out

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `encode` | WAV → AC-3. Without `[layout]`, follows the source channel count (1→mono, 2→stereo, 3–6→5.1); a wider source is refused, since no AC-3 coding mode is wider than 3/2 + LFE. |
| `eac3-encode` | WAV → E-AC-3, with the Annex E `tools:` token and an optional `vbr:` token available (see [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md)). Without `[layout]`, follows the source channel count (1→mono, 2→stereo, 3–6→5.1, 8→7.1, 10→5.1.4, 12→7.1.4). |
| `atmos-encode` | WAV → E-AC-3 Atmos, every source channel becomes its own object; optional `[paths.txt]` drives per-object motion from an authored scene file the same way `atmos-path` does, keyed by WAV channel index — an object it doesn't mention keeps its default (fanned-out) placement. With `codec=ac4` it writes AC-4 objects instead: see [AC-4 objects from a WAV](#ac-4-objects-from-a-wav) below |
| `atmos-cbi` | WAV already mixed into a fixed channel-based-immersive (CBI) bed layout → E-AC-3 Atmos with `program.bed != 0` and 0 dynamic objects — Dolby's `dee_ddpjoc_encoder --input-format cbi_wav` shape, not free-floating objects |
| `ac4-encode` | WAV → AC-4: mono, stereo, 5.0, 5.1, 5.0.4 or 5.1.4 (7.0, 7.1, 7.0.4, 7.1.4 and 3.0 experimental), at 48 kHz at every frame rate of Part 1 Table 83 or at 44.1 kHz at the native one, as raw sync frames with their CRC (or without, `crc=off`) or, for `.mp4`, `.m4a` or `.mov`, an MP4 file with the `ac-4` sample entry and its `dac4`. The codec mode follows the rate: SIMPLE from 96 kbps a channel (76.8 in 5.X), the ASPX mode below, in 5.X the A-CPL modes lower still, and in the immersive layouts ASPX_ACPL_2, ASPX_SCPL and SCPL by the rate. The frame rate, the rate mode, the I-frames, the metadata, and further substreams and the presentations that play them are options: see [`ac4-encode`](#ac4-encode) below |

```bash
forge encode in.wav out.ac3 448 couple
```

448 kbps, channel coupling on, layout inferred from the WAV's channel count.

`1+1` (dual mono — two independent programmes, never inferred from a channel count, so it always
has to be named explicitly) takes its two channels either as one two-channel file or as two mono
ones:

```bash
forge encode both.wav out.ac3 192 1+1                    # Ch1/Ch2 = channels 0/1 of both.wav
forge encode narration_en.wav out.ac3 192 1+1 narration_fr.wav  # Ch1, Ch2 as separate files
```

See [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md) for `dialnorm2=` — Ch2's own dialnorm, alongside
the usual `dialnorm=`.

`encode`, `eac3-encode`, `ac4-encode`, `atmos-encode` and `atmos-cbi` all take `-` in place of
`<in.wav>` or the output path to mean stdin or stdout (the other commands that take it are listed
under [Conventions](index.md#conventions-shared-across-commands)), so a pipeline never has to touch
a temporary file:

```bash
forge encode - - 448 couple < in.wav > out.ac3
```

The status text these commands normally print (frame count, routing, per-channel levels,
`dialnorm=auto`'s measurement line) goes to stderr instead of stdout whenever the output side is
`-`, so it never ends up inside the piped stream — `src=`/`map=` multi-source runs included.

```bash
forge atmos-cbi bed_714.wav out.ec3 448 7.1.4
```

`bed_714.wav`'s 12 channels are read in `iclforge::objects::oba::bed_labels()`'s own Table 12 order — L, R, C,
LFE, Ls, Rs, Lb, Rb, Tfl, Tfr, Tbl, Tbr for 7.1.4 — which is also Dolby's own `cbi_wav` channel
order (confirmed against a real DEE-produced 5.1.4 stream; 7.1.4/9.1.6 extend it by the same
Table 12 rule, unverified against DEE itself). `[layout]` is one of `5.1.4`, `7.1.4`, `9.1.6` and
defaults to whichever one matches the file's channel count (10, 12 or 16) when omitted. Unlike
`atmos-encode`, every channel is anchored to its speaker label rather than free-floating, so there
is no `[paths.txt]` argument and `dialnorm=auto` is refused for the same reason it is on
`atmos-adm`/`atmos-iab` below — see [Atmos & JOC](../../concepts/atmos-joc.md#oamd) and
[Spatial & Atmos objects](../../library/spatial-and-atmos.md#channel-based-immersive-cbi-beds).

#### `ac4-encode`

A WAV file's channels are taken in the order `decode` writes them: FL FR FC LFE BL BR for 5.1, the
surrounds in BL and BR; 5.1.4 adds the top front pair (TFL TFR) and then the top back pair (TBL
TBR), and 5.0.4 is the same without the LFE. The layout is the channel count: 1 mono, 2 stereo, 5
and 6 5.0 and 5.1, 9 and 10 5.0.4 and 5.1.4 (ETSI TS 103 190-2's immersive element with its back
pair absent, which is how DEE writes 5.1.4). The experimental options below name the other layouts
the encoder writes: 7.0 and 7.1, 7.0.4 and 7.1.4, 3.0, and 22.2 (24 channels).

**Codec mode.** Below 96 kbps a channel the ASPX codec mode: the spectral frontend up to a crossover
of 7.5, 10.5 or 13.5 kHz by rate, A-SPX above it, and companding below 64 kbps a channel; in 5.X
below 76.8 kbps a channel (384 kbps for 5.1), with DEE's 5.1 crossovers of 12 and 12.75 kHz and no
companding; the SIMPLE mode from there. In 5.X, lower still, the A-CPL modes, which code a downmix
and rebuild the channels from it: ASPX_ACPL_2 below 33.6 kbps a channel (168 kbps for 5.1), the
downmixes of each side's pair and C, and ASPX_ACPL_3 below 22.4 (112 kbps for 5.1), a Lo/Ro
downmix, as DEE's 5.1 streams are at 128 and 96 kbps; where the rate cannot hold that mode's least
frame, the next of ASPX_ACPL_2 and ASPX that it can. The rate must hold a silent I-frame with
every metadata element the options send: at the native frame rate from 8 kbps (9 in stereo at
48 kHz in the ASPX mode) and, in 5.X, from 13 kbps by default (14 in ASPX_ACPL_3, 15 in ASPX), more
at the higher frame rates and with more metadata.

The immersive layouts choose by the rate over 5.1.4's nine full-band channels, as DEE's 5.1.4
streams do: ASPX_ACPL_2 below 480 kbps (53.3 kbps a channel), which codes L, R and C and the sum of
each coupled pair and rebuilds each pair by A-CPL; ASPX_SCPL below 640 kbps (71.1), which codes
each pair's sum and difference with simple coupling and A-SPX from 12.75 kHz; and SCPL from there,
simple coupling over the whole band. `codec-mode=` picks one whatever the rate: `auto` (the
default), `simple`, `aspx`, `aspx-acpl-1` (with `experimental=acpl`), `aspx-acpl-2`,
`aspx-acpl-3` (5.0 and 5.1 alone), `scpl`, `aspx-scpl` and `aspx-ajcc` (with
`experimental=ajcc`); the last three are the immersive layouts' alone. An encode names the mode it
used on its second summary line.

**Experimental.** `experimental=` takes a comma-separated list of the tools no reader outside this
project has read from the encoder yet: `aspx-balance`, `aspx-varvar`, `aspx-interleave`,
`coding-configs` (the 5.X element's coding configurations 1 to 3 and `2ch_mode` 1), `acpl` (with
`codec-mode=aspx-acpl-1`, ASPX_ACPL_1 in 5.X and the immersive layouts, which also codes each
side's difference from its downmix to 3 kHz; with `aspx-acpl-1` or `aspx-acpl-2`, A-CPL in stereo),
`ajcc` (with `codec-mode=aspx-ajcc`, the immersive layouts coded through A-JCC's 5.X core) and
`drc-gains-0` to `drc-gains-3` (the DRC modes send gains in that `drc_gains_config` of Part 1
Table 163); `7x-back`, `7x-wide` or `7x-top-front`, which takes seven or eight channels as 7.0 or
7.1 in that 7.X layout, in the WAV order `decode` writes: 3/4/0's back pair in BL and BR and its
surrounds in SL and SR, 5/2/0's wide pair last, 3/2/2's top front pair in TFL and TFR;
`back-pair`, which takes 11 and 12 channels as 7.0.4 and 7.1.4, with Lb and Rb; `nine-x-4`, which
takes 13 and 14 channels as 9.0.4 and 9.1.4, the immersive element with the screen pair Lscr and Rscr
(SCPL, ASPX_SCPL and ASPX_ACPL_2 by the rate, and with `acpl` ASPX_ACPL_1; it refuses `ajcc`, dialogue
enhancement and `height-downmix=`, and its thirteen tracks make the stream `md_compat` 7, which
`decode` takes with `md-compat=7`); `three-zero`, which takes three channels, L R C, as 3.0, the
dialogue of a music and effects presentation (below);
`noise-fill`, which sends each scale factor band that quantises to zero a noise level (Part 1
5.1.4: its own energy in 3 dB steps, from the level before it) that the decoder fills with noise,
and so trades some SNR for a spectrum without holes at a low rate; `hfr-2` and `hfr-4`, the
efficient high frame rate mode (Part 2 5.1.3): with `frame-rate=` 47.95 to 120 (`hfr-4` from 100)
the encoder codes at half or a quarter of that rate (Table 18) and sends each frame as two or four
transmission frames, which a decoder joins again; a constant rate only; `twenty-two-two`, which
takes 24 channels as 22.2, the element of ETSI TS 103 190-2 clause 6.2.4.3 (below); and `objects`,
which
`objects=<scene file>` needs.

**22.2.** With `experimental=twenty-two-two`, a 24-channel WAV file is written as the 22.2 channel
element: two LFE tracks and eleven channel pairs, in the SIMPLE and ASPX codec modes
(`codec-mode=simple` or `aspx`). The channels are taken in the order `decode` writes a 22.2 stream
in: L R C LFE (FL FR FC LFE), Lb Rb Cb (BL BR BC), Ls Rs (SL SR), Tc Tfl Tsl Tfc Tfr Tsr Tbl Tbc Tbr
(TC TFL TSL TFC TFR TSR TBL TBC TBR), then LFE2, Bfl, Bfr, Bfc, Lw and Rw. The default codec mode is
ASPX below 76.8 kbps a full-band channel (1 690 kbps over the 22 of them) and SIMPLE from there. The
A-CPL, S-CPL and A-JCC modes, the stereo and height downmix values, dialogue enhancement and DRC
gains are refused for it. The rate must hold the element's least frame: 17 kbps in SIMPLE and 49 in
ASPX at the native frame rate (15 and 45 at 44.1 kHz), more at the higher frame rates, and the
encoder's refusal names a rate that cannot. A decoder takes the presentation at `md-compat=7`
(22 tracks, Part 2 Table 55). An MP4 file carries it with a `dac4`.

**Objects.** With `experimental=objects`, `objects=<scene file>` takes the WAV file's channels as the
objects of one object substream, written as a raw stream. The scene file is text, one directive a
line, `#` starting a comment; channels count from 0, and one the file does not name is a dynamic
object at the room's centre. It is written in the library's terms (`iclforge::ac4::ObjectsConfig`, `iclforge::ac4::ObjectProperties`);
reading ADM BWF, IAB and object scenes into them belongs to the applications (`atmos-encode`,
`atmos-adm` and `atmos-iab` below write AC-4 objects from those). An object stream reads
`frame-rate=`, `rate-mode=`, `iframe-interval=`, `crc=`, `dialnorm=` (a number, not `auto`),
`codec-mode=simple` or `aspx` and `syntax-trace=`; the other options are not read.

| Directive | What it sets |
|---|---|
| `coding ajoc` or `coding direct` | An A-JOC substream (the default) or direct-coded object substreams |
| `downmix computed`, `5.0` or `5.1` | A-JOC's downmix: computed signals, or a static bed |
| `downmix-signals <n>` | The computed downmix's signals |
| `decorrelation on` or `decorrelation off` | A-JOC's decorrelators |
| `object <channel> dynamic <x> <y> <z> [<gain dB>]` | A dynamic object where it starts: X, Y 0 to 1, Z -1 to 1 |
| `object <channel> bed <L\|R\|C\|Ls\|Rs\|Lb\|Rb\|Tfl\|Tfr\|Tsl\|Tsr\|Tbl\|Tbr\|Lw\|Rw> [<gain dB>]` | A bed object on that loudspeaker |
| `object <channel> lfe` | The LFE |
| `update <channel> <sample> <ramp> <x> <y> <z> [<gain dB>]` | The object moves there from that input sample over `<ramp>` samples (0 to 2 048) |

**Frame rate and rate mode.** `frame-rate=` is one of Table 83's rates, `23.976`, `24`, `25`,
`29.97`, `30`, `47.95`, `48`, `50`, `59.94`, `60`, `100`, `119.88` or `120`, or `native`, the
default: 2 048-sample frames, the only ones at 44.1 kHz. Away from the native frame rate the
input is converted to the frame's internal rate, and each frame decodes to the samples Part 2
clause 5.11 gives it: at 29.97 fps 1 601 and 1 602 in turn. `rate-mode=constant`, the default,
gives every frame the rate's share; `average` lets frames lend each other bytes within the
decoder's input buffer (Part 1 clause 6.2.4), with `wait_frames` telling a decoder how long to
wait; `variable` lends up to two seconds' share.

**I-frames.** `iframe-interval=<frames>` (default 24) makes every so many frames an I-frame,
`iframes=<n,...>` names frames, from 0, that are I-frames besides, and `fragment=<seconds>` makes
the first frame of each fragment of that length one, for a packager that cuts there. An MP4 file
lists the I-frames as its sync samples, and counts 29.97, 59.94 and 119.88 fps in a time scale of
240 000 (Part 2 Table E.1); `mp4` does the same for an AC-4 stream it is given.

**Loudness and DRC.** `dialnorm=` is the dialogue level in dB below full scale, 0 to 31.75 in
steps of 0.25, or `auto` to measure it. `loudness=<practice>`, one of `atsc-a85`, `ebu-r128`,
`arib-tr-b32`, `freetv-op59`, `manual`, `consumer-leveller` and `not-indicated`, measures the
programme with the BS.1770 meter and sends its integrated loudness, loudness range, true peak and
highest momentary and short-term loudness with that practice, and sets dialnorm from it where
`dialnorm=` is not given. `drc=<profile>`, one of `film-standard`, `film-light`,
`music-standard`, `music-light`, `speech` and `none`, sends Table 161's four DRC decoder modes on
that profile; `drc-home-theatre=`, `drc-flat-panel-tv=`, `drc-portable-speakers=` and
`drc-portable-headphones=` give one mode a profile of its own, sent as its curve or as a repeat
of an earlier mode on the same profile.

**Downmix, 5.X, 7.X and the immersive layouts.** `cmixlev=` or `lorocmixlev=` is the Lo/Ro
downmix's centre gain, +3, +1.5, 0, -1.5, -3, -4.5 or -6 dB or `off`; `surmixlev=` or
`lorosurmixlev=` its surround gain, 0, -1.5, -3, -4.5 or -6 dB or `off`; `ltrtcmixlev=` and
`ltrtsurmixlev=` Lt/Rt's where they differ. `lfemix=` is the LFE's gain into the downmix, +5.5 to
-25.5 dB in steps of 1 dB, and `dmixmod=` the preferred downmix, `loro`, `ltrt`, `pl2` (Lt/Rt for
Pro Logic II) or `none`. `loro-correction=` and `ltrt-correction=` are each downmix's loudness
correction, -7.5 to +7.5 dB in steps of 0.5. A layout with fewer than five channels has no such
downmix, and the encoder refuses these options for it. The immersive layouts (5.0.4, 5.1.4, 7.0.4,
7.1.4) take them for their stereo downmix and add a second downmix, to 5.X, which they send as TS
103 190-2's custom downmix data in the I-frames, as DEE does: `height-downmix=front` puts both top
pairs into L and R, `surround` both into Ls and Rs, and `front-and-surround` the top front pair
into L and R and the top back pair into Ls and Rs. `height-gain=` is the gain the top channels go
in at, `0`, `-1.5`, `-3` (the default), `-4.5`, `-6`, `-9` or `-12` dB, or `off`, and needs
`height-downmix=`.

**Dialogue enhancement.** `dialogue-channels=` marks which of `l`, `r` and `c` carry dialogue
alone, whose parameters are then 1 in every band; `dialogue-stem=<wav>` gives the dialogue, in the
programme's channels and sample for sample, and each band's parameter is its share of the channel.
`dialogue-method=independent`, the default, raises each channel; `mid` raises the Mid of L and R;
`cross`, with a stem over two or three channels, raises a mix of the channels that follows the
dialogue and pans it back as the dialogue is panned. `dialogue-max-gain=` caps what a decoder may
add: 3, 6, 9 (the default) or 12 dB. `dialogue-hybrid=<0..1>` makes the method a hybrid one: a
dialogue enhancement substream carries the dialogue itself as a waveform, that share of the
enhancement, and the parameters raise it by the rest (Part 1 clause 5.7.8.9); `substreamN-enhances=`
below names that substream.

**Substreams.** Without the options below the output is one substream in one presentation, with
`presentation_id` 0 and the `md_compat` level its layout needs. The input is substream 1, and
`substream2=<wav>` up to `substream32=` add more, each an input of its own layout at the input's
rate and length. `substreamN-<option>=` sets substream N's own values:

| Option | What it sets |
|---|---|
| `substreamN-bitrate=<kbps>` | Its share of the rate; the substreams without one share the rest by their full-band channels |
| `substreamN-codec-mode=` | Its codec mode, as `codec-mode=` (which is substream 1's) |
| `substreamN-content=` | Part 1 Table 91's content classifier: `main`, `music-and-effects`, `visually-impaired`, `hearing-impaired`, `dialogue`, `commentary`, `emergency` or `voice-over` |
| `substreamN-language=<tag>` | Its BCP 47 language tag, with a classifier to carry it |
| `substreamN-dialogue-...=` | Its dialogue enhancement, as the `dialogue-` options above (which are substream 1's) |
| `substreamN-max-dialogue-gain=` | A dialogue substream's cap on how far a listener may raise it, 3, 6, 9 or 12 dB |
| `substreamN-pan=<degrees>[,<degrees>]` | Where a mono dialogue's channel sits, or each of a stereo one's two, clockwise from the front: 330 is L, 30 R |
| `substreamN-emdf=<id>:<hex>` | An EMDF payload its metadata carries in every frame, repeated for more; the id from 1 |
| `substreamN-enhances=<M>` | In place of an input: this substream carries the waveform of substream M's hybrid dialogue enhancement |

**Presentations.** Several substreams need presentations to play them. `presentationN=<substreams>`,
N from 1 to 64, lists the substreams a presentation plays, from 1, in the order of Part 2 Table 53's
positions, and `presentationN-<option>=` sets its own values:

| Option | What it sets |
|---|---|
| `presentationN-config=` | Table 53's configuration: 0 music and effects with dialogue, 1 main with dialogue enhancement, 2 main with associated audio, 3 music and effects with dialogue and associated audio, 4 main with dialogue enhancement and associated audio, 5 roles by each substream's classifier, 6 EMDF payloads alone, which plays no substream; unset for one substream |
| `presentationN-id=` | Its `presentation_id`, unset for the least no other presentation takes |
| `presentationN-md-compat=` | Its level, 0 to 3 or 7 (Table 55), not below what its tracks need |
| `presentationN-enabled=`, `-pre-virtualized=` | `on` or `off` |
| `presentationN-name=` | An alternative presentation of this name, up to 31 bytes |
| `presentationN-dialnorm=` | Its own dialogue level, as `dialnorm=` |
| `presentationN-gains=<dB>,...` | Each substream's group gain, 0 to -15.5 dB in steps of 0.25, or `off` |
| `presentationN-main-gain=`, `-main-centre-gain=`, `-main-front-gain=` | The main audio's scaling beside associated audio, 0 to -76.2 dB in steps of 0.3, or `off` |
| `presentationN-associated-pan=` | Where mono associated audio sits, in degrees |
| `presentationN-emdf=<id>:<hex>` | An EMDF payload in an EMDF payloads substream the presentation names |

The bare options set every presentation's values: the loudness, DRC and downmix values, the last
going to the presentations of 5.X and 7.X. `dialnorm=auto` and `loudness=` measure one programme,
so they take one substream. The encoder refuses what does not go together, naming the rule. An MP4
file's `dac4` describes every presentation (Part 2 Annex E.10); a presentation of configuration 6
has no field for the `presentation_id` a CMAF track asks of each, so `fmp4` refuses a stream that
has one.

**Output.** A raw stream's sync frames carry Part 2 Annex G's CRC unless `crc=off`; an MP4
sample is the raw frame alone. `syntax-trace=<file>` writes every syntax element the encoder writes,
one per line. The summary names the codec mode, the frame rate and the rate mode, and how far the
decoder's output lags the input, to the nearest sample away from the native frame rate.

```bash
forge ac4-encode in.wav out.mp4 128 frame-rate=29.97 rate-mode=average iframe-interval=15
forge ac4-encode in_51.wav out.ac4 384 loudness=ebu-r128 drc=film-light dmixmod=loro dialogue-channels=c

### ADM ingest — professional master files (opt-in)

**Only *runnable* in a build with `-DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`** — but always *listed*, the same
"a command a build cannot run is shown, not hidden" treatment the live-audio commands below get
(see that section's own note): a default build's usage block at the top of this page shows this
row as `UNAVAILABLE HERE` instead of the description below, and running it prints a clear reason
(`forge atmos-adm ...` → `error: 'atmos-adm' is unavailable on this platform: this build was not
configured with -DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON ...`) rather than "unknown command". Three things in the
tool need `iclforge::adm`, this project's sole opt-in, Boost-requiring module
(default **off** — see [ADM / BW64 reading](../../library/adm.md#why-opt-in)): this command,
`atmos-iab` below, and `decode`'s optional `adm_out` argument. Everything else builds and works
identically whether that flag is on or off. What the row looks like in a build configured
with the flag on (the usage block at the top of this page is from a *default* build, where
this row instead reads `UNAVAILABLE HERE`):

```text
  forge atmos-adm    <in.adm.wav> <out.ec3|out.ac4> [bitrate_kbps] [programme_id] (a real ADM BWF master (BS.2076-2 ADM XML + BW64/RF64, ADM BWF reader) straight to DD+ JOC E-AC-3 (default) or, with codec=ac4, to an AC-4 A-JOC or direct-coded object substream (coding=ajoc, the default, or coding=direct); every bed/object channel the resolved audioProgramme names becomes a dynamic object, driven by the file's own authored automation - no scene file needed. Only in builds with -DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON)
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `atmos-adm` | A real ADM BWF master (professional delivery format Netflix's and Apple's own Atmos ingest pipelines require) straight to DD+ JOC E-AC-3 — no WAV, no hand-authored keyframe file: [`iclforge::adm::build`](../../library/adm-bridge.md) classifies every channel as a bed speaker feed or a dynamic object and builds its own `iclforge::objects::oba::ObjectPath` straight from the file's authored BS.2076-2 §10.3 position/gain automation, driven frame by frame the same way `atmos-encode` drives an authored `[paths.txt]`. With `codec=ac4` (planning/ac4.md, I5), every bed/object channel becomes an AC-4 dynamic object instead (A-JOC by default, `coding=direct` for direct-coded object substreams), its position sampled once a frame (frame_rate_index 13 is the object substream's only rate) |

```bash
forge atmos-adm master.wav out.ec3 448
```

448 kbps, the file's lowest-ID `audioProgramme` (BS.2076-2 §5.8's own default-selection rule).
Pass a fourth argument to pick a different one by ID:

```bash
forge atmos-adm master.wav out.ec3 448 APR_1002
```

`codec=ac4` writes AC-4 instead of E-AC-3, its objects A-JOC-coded unless `coding=direct` asks for
direct-coded object substreams:

```bash
forge atmos-adm master.wav out.ac4 256 codec=ac4
forge atmos-adm master.wav out.ac4 256 codec=ac4 coding=direct
forge decode out.ac4 out.wav objects_dir adm_out.wav
```

That `decode` line closes the round trip: `objects_dir` writes each object's own PCM, and
`adm_out.wav` (needs `-DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`) writes a fresh ADM BWF master back out, its
objects' positions, gains and timing read from what the AC-4 stream's own Annex F metadata says.

#### AC-4 objects from a WAV

`atmos-encode` takes `codec=ac4` too (planning/ac4.md, I5b), and writes the objects it makes of a
WAV file's channels, or of `src=`, `map=` and `offset=`, as AC-4 objects: A-JOC-coded unless
`coding=direct` asks for direct-coded object substreams, a raw stream (with Part 2 Annex G's CRC
unless `crc=off`) or, for an `.mp4`, `.m4a` or `.mov` output name, an MP4 file.
[GUI → Objects & motion](../gui/objects-and-motion.md#ac-4-objects) echoes this command, and the
two write the same bytes.

```bash
forge atmos-encode stems.wav out.ac4 256 codec=ac4
forge atmos-encode stems.wav out.mp4 256 0 scene.json src=vo.wav \
    map=0.0:obj,0.1:obj@-3,1.0:L,1.1:LFE offset=1:0.02 codec=ac4 coding=direct dialnorm=27
```

- **Which channels are objects** follows `src=`/`map=` as it does for E-AC-3: each `obj` row its
  own object, an `objm` range folded to one, in that order. A channel mapped to a speaker is a
  dynamic object held at the speaker's place on the ring of radius 0.5 about the room's centre
  at its azimuth, the place ADM's polar coordinates give a bed channel, at unity; one mapped to
  an LFE is the stream's LFE object. These follow the `obj`/`objm` objects in `map=` order, the
  speakers' in source-then-channel order, the LFE last. `[objects]` is the E-AC-3 command's count
  of channels and stays 0 with `map=`.
- **Motion** comes from the scene file (`[paths.txt]`), addressed by the dynamic objects' order
  above; an object it does not mention keeps the default placement `atmos-encode` gives it for
  E-AC-3. The stream takes one position update per object per frame, evaluated at the frame's
  end, at 2 048 samples a frame (frame_rate_index 13, the only rate an object substream is
  written at). A key's gain must be 0 or lie from +15 to -49 dB, and its place inside the room.
- **The limits** are E9's writer's: 64 objects at most, one of them an LFE object, at 48 or
  44.1 kHz, and at least one object that is not the LFE. A source shorter than the longest
  is silent past its end, where `atmos-encode`'s E-AC-3 runs with `src=` hold each short
  source's last sample.
- **Options.** `dialnorm=1..31` sets the stream's dialnorm; `dialnorm=auto` and `sign-objects`
  are refused (an object stream has no bed to measure and no EMDF container to sign), and
  `coding=` and `crc=` without `codec=ac4` are refused rather than dropped.

`dialnorm=` works the same as every other encoding command (see
[Options & grammars](metadata-options.md)); `dialnorm=auto` does not — an ADM document's bed/object
channels have no single fixed layout to measure loudness against the way `atmos-encode`'s WAV
input does, so `atmos-adm` refuses it with a clear error rather than silently keeping the default.

Every failure — a container/XML parse error (`iclforge::adm::AdmError`) or a graph-resolution error
(`iclforge::adm::BridgeError`, e.g. no `audioProgramme`, an unresolved reference, an unsupported
pack type) — prints a real diagnosis via that error's own `describe()`, never an opaque crash or a
bare non-zero exit.

See [ADM / BW64 reading](../../library/adm.md) and [ADM → Atmos bridging](../../library/adm-bridge.md)
for the parser and the mapping layer this command drives, and
[`examples/encode_adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/encode_adm.cpp)
for the same pipeline as a minimal, standalone, self-fixturing program.

### IAB ingest — Dolby Atmos cinema/IMF masters (opt-in)

**Only *runnable* in a build with `-DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`** — the identical gate and the same
`UNAVAILABLE HERE`/clear-error treatment `atmos-adm` above gets, and for the same underlying
reason even though `iclforge::iab` itself is on by default: this command needs
[`iclforge::adm`'s own IAB mapping](../../library/adm-bridge.md#bridging-iab)
(`build_iab()`), and that whole module rides `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM` (see
[ADM / BW64 reading](../../library/adm.md#why-opt-in)) since it PUBLIC-links `iclforge::adm`
alongside `iclforge::iab`. What the row looks like in a build configured with the flag on (the
usage block at the top of this page is from a *default* build, where this row instead reads
`UNAVAILABLE HERE`):

```text
  forge atmos-iab     <in.iab|in.mxf> <out.ec3|out.ac4> [bitrate_kbps] (a real Dolby Atmos cinema/IMF master (SMPTE ST 2098-2 Immersive Audio Bitstream, a bare elementary .iab file or a real MXF Track File alike - IAB reader) straight to DD+ JOC E-AC-3 (default) or, with codec=ac4, to an AC-4 A-JOC or direct-coded object substream (coding=ajoc, the default, or coding=direct); every Bed channel/Object the file names becomes a dynamic object, driven by the file's own authored panning - no scene file needed. Only in builds with -DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON)
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `atmos-iab` | A real Immersive Audio Bitstream (SMPTE ST 2098-2) master — a bare elementary `.iab` file or a real MXF Track File alike, sniffed automatically by its first byte — straight to DD+ JOC E-AC-3: [`iclforge::adm::build_iab`](../../library/adm-bridge.md#bridging-iab) classifies every Bed channel/Object and builds its own `iclforge::objects::oba::ObjectPath` from the file's own per-frame panning, driven frame by frame the same way `atmos-adm` drives an ADM master. `codec=ac4`/`coding=` work exactly as `atmos-adm`'s own do (planning/ac4.md, I5) |

```bash
forge atmos-iab master.iab out.ec3 448
```

The same command reads a real MXF Track File too, no different invocation:

```bash
forge atmos-iab master.mxf out.ec3 448
```

```bash
forge atmos-iab master.iab out.ac4 256 codec=ac4 coding=direct
```

`dialnorm=` works the same as every other encoding command (see
[Options & grammars](metadata-options.md)); `dialnorm=auto` does not — an IAB file's Bed/Object
channels have no single fixed layout to measure loudness against the way `atmos-encode`'s WAV
input does, so `atmos-iab` refuses it with a clear error rather than silently keeping the default.

Every failure — a bitstream/MXF parse error (`iclforge::iab::IabError`) or a graph-resolution error
(`iclforge::adm::BridgeError`, e.g. a Table 19 `ChannelID` that is Reserved, or
essence that never resolved) — prints a real diagnosis via that error's own `describe()`, never an
opaque crash or a bare non-zero exit.

See [IAB reading](../../library/iab.md) and
[ADM → Atmos bridging](../../library/adm-bridge.md#bridging-iab) for the parser
and the mapping layer this command drives, and
[`examples/encode_iab.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/encode_iab.cpp)
for the same pipeline as a minimal, standalone, self-fixturing program.

### Object-layer strip

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `strip-objects` | Takes the JOC/OAMD object layer **out** of a Dolby Digital Plus stream without decoding it, leaving a plain DD+ 5.1 stream whose bed audio is bit-identical |

```bash
forge strip-objects atmos.ec3 bed51.ec3
```

```text
stripped 63 of 63 frame(s) in atmos.ec3 -> bed51.ec3 (7032 bytes removed, 105864 left)
  3/2 + LFE at 48000 Hz, no object metadata remains
```

JOC's bed is the full mix — every object is already panned into it, which is what makes an
Atmos DD+ stream play on an Atmos-unaware decoder at all. So the 5.1 rendition of a JOC stream
needs no re-encode, only the object layer removed: the EMDF container in the per-block skip
fields and TS 103 420 §8.3.1's `addbsi` marker come out, `frmsiz` and `crc2` are re-derived
around what is left, and every exponent and mantissa is copied bit for bit. Decoding the result
gives sample-identical PCM. See [Object-layer strip](../../library/decoding.md#object-layer-strip)
for what it does and does not touch.

The container is removed, not emptied — an empty container would still tell every downstream
signalling path (`dec3`'s Atmos extension, an HLS `CHANNELS="<N>/JOC"` attribute) that objects
are present. The same goes for the `addbsi` marker on its own: a stream that signals objects it
does not carry gets that signalling removed too. A stream with no object layer at all is copied
through unchanged; an AC-3 stream is refused, since Annex E is where skip fields and substreams
live.

Rewritten frames are sized to their real content, so the output is smaller than the input and a
constant-rate input does not stay constant-rate — the encoder's rate-filling auxdata padding
goes along with the container. The reported byte count says how much.

This is what `fmp4 … fallback-51` uses to write the paired 5.1 rendition Apple's HLS authoring
requirements ask for beside an Atmos one.

### Decoding & inspection

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `decode` | AC-3, E-AC-3 or AC-4 → WAV; the stream decides which decoder runs (for AC-4, mono, stereo, 3.0, 5.X and 7.X in the SIMPLE, ASPX and A-CPL codec modes, and 7.0.4 and 7.1.4 in every immersive codec mode, in [full or core decoding and to the layout `speakers=` names](#ac-4-immersive-speakers-and-decoding), written in WAV speaker order, and of a stream of several presentations the one [`presentation=`, `language=` and `associated=`](#ac-4-presentations-presentation-language-associated) choose, its substreams mixed; a presentation with A-JOC or direct-coded objects renders them to the output's speakers as coded, 7.1.4 by default). The input may be a Matroska/MP4/MPEG-TS container as well as a bare elementary stream, sniffed by content rather than by name — the same three readers `demux` uses. For an Atmos E-AC-3 stream or an AC-4 stream with objects, reports the object count found and, with `objects_dir`, exports each decoded object as its own `object_NN.wav` there — JOC-reconstructed for E-AC-3, D10's own decoded objects for AC-4. With `adm_out` (needs `-DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`), also writes a Dolby Atmos Master ADM Profile BW64 there: for E-AC-3, the bed's LFE plus every JOC-reconstructed channel (a channel-based-immersive bed's channels pinned to their speakers, a dynamic object positioned by its own decoded OAMD automation); for AC-4, every bed and dynamic object with its own decoded Annex F properties |
| `probe` | What a stream *declares*, without rendering its audio: bsid, sample rate, layout, substream map, counts, duration, bit rate, metadata ranges, EMDF/OAMD/JOC, authenticity, per-frame CRC and coding-tool usage. Human table by default, or the `iclforge.probe/1` JSON document with `json=1`. An AC-4 stream gets its table of contents, frame rate, bit rate, I-frames and splices, and each presentation with the metadata the decoder reads of it. The input may be a Matroska, MP4 or MPEG-TS container, sniffed by content: the report then also says what the container declares of the track (codec ID, sample entry or descriptor, time scale, language), in the JSON document as `container`, which is `null` for a bare stream |
| `levels` | Per-channel peak/RMS report — takes a WAV, a bare encoded stream, or a Matroska/MP4/MPEG-TS container carrying one; of an AC-4 stream, the presentation [`presentation=` and the rest](#ac-4-presentations-presentation-language-associated) choose, as coded |
| `loudness` | BS.1770-4 gated loudness, reported as the `dialnorm` it implies: of a WAV; of an AC-3 or E-AC-3 stream's first programme, beside the `dialnorm` it carries; or of an AC-4 presentation as coded, in AC-4's steps of 0.25 dB, beside the stream's own. Bare or inside a container |
| `qc` | Bitstream-aware loudness QC: decodes an already-encoded AC-3, E-AC-3 or AC-4 stream — bare, or inside a Matroska/MP4/MPEG-TS container — measures it with the real BS.1770-4/EBU Tech 3342 meter — the Table 5.8 bed by default, the whole rendered program with `layout=rendered`, or a dynamic-object-only programme's objects re-rendered onto a named layout with `objects=<layout>` (BS.1770-5 Annex 4) — and compares the result against the stream's own embedded `dialnorm`/`compr` and, optionally, a named delivery-spec gate. An AC-4 presentation is measured as coded (no output level, so no DRC) against its `dialnorm` and the loudness it states; `layout=` takes it too, and `objects=` does not (see below). One that decodes at 96 or 192 kHz is refused by name: the meter's K-weighting is made for 44.1 and 48 kHz |

```bash
forge decode out.ec3 out.wav
```

`decode` takes `-` for either path too, the same convention the encoding commands above (and the
five stream tools below) use:

```bash
forge decode - - < out.ac3 > out.wav
```

It decodes on the fast (FFT) inverse-transform path by default; `mode=reference` or
`fast-imdct=off` selects the spec's direct evaluation instead — see
[Validation → Performance and reference modes](../../verification.md#performance-and-reference-modes)
for what each mode is for, and [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md) for the token rules.

A stream carrying more than one programme (a second independent substream — a second language,
an audio description) is handled one programme at a time: `decode`, `levels` and `qc` all take
`programme=<0..7>`, and without it take the first the stream carries while saying what else was
there. See [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md) for the token, and `eac3-encode`'s
`programme2=` for authoring such a stream.

```bash
forge decode out.ec3 commentary.wav programme=1
```

For an Atmos stream, add `objects_dir` to also export each object's reconstructed audio:

```bash
forge decode atmos.ec3 bed.wav objects/
```

Or add a fourth argument (`objects_dir` empty or not) to write an ADM BWF master instead —
positions come from the stream's own decoded OAMD, so `master.wav` round-trips through
`forge atmos-adm` (needs `-DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`; without that flag an `adm_out`
on an E-AC-3 input is refused before the decode starts, exit `2`, naming the flag):

```bash
forge decode atmos.ec3 bed.wav "" master.wav
```

The object export works for a bed programme too, which is what channel-based-immersive
third-party content is: a 7.1.4 bed carried in a 5.1 downmix exports its eleven non-LFE channels
(§6.3.2.2 never makes the LFE a JOC output), and the status report names them (`bed [L R C LFE Ls
Rs Lb Rb Tfl Tfr Tbl Tbr] + 0 dynamic objects`) rather than just counting them. The ADM master
holds a bed programme as well: each bed channel is a `DirectSpeakers` channel named by its Table 12
label and pinned at that label's position, beside the dynamic objects' own timelines, and the LFE
(which JOC bypasses) comes from the decoded bed. A programme with ISF objects, a second bed
instance, a Table 13 bed assignment or an LFE2 has no label for some channel, so it gets a warning
saying so and no master file written, while the WAV and `objects_dir` outputs of the same run are
unaffected. The report also names an OAMD trim element when one rides along, any `oa_element`
skipped because its id is unrecognised, and how many metadata update blocks a frame carries when
it carries more than one.

### The output stage: `channels=`, `downmix=`, `drcmode=`

By default `decode` writes the channels the stream codes, at the level it codes them — which is
what a verification tool should do, and not what a listener wants. `channels=` turns on the §7.8
output stage:

```bash
forge decode surround.ac3 stereo.wav channels=2
forge decode surround.ac3 stereo.wav downmix=ltrt      # implies channels=2
forge decode surround.ac3 mono.wav   channels=1
```

`channels=2` produces §7.8.1's Lo/Ro fold, `downmix=ltrt` §7.8.2's Dolby Surround compatible
Lt/Rt (whose surround sum really is phase shifted 90°, costing 63 samples of output delay;
`ltrt-phase=off` takes the sign-only matrix instead), and `channels=1` §7.8's mono branch. The
matrix comes from the stream's own `cmixlev`/`surmixlev` or `mixmdate` levels, and §7.8.1's
normalisation means the fold can never be louder than the loudest coded sample. `mix-lfe` folds
the LFE in as well — §7.8 makes that optional and this decoder drops it by default.

`downmix=auto` lets the stream choose between the two stereo folds, the third option A/52
§D3.1.1 describes. The stream's preference is its `dmixmod` (Table D2.2): in AC-3's Annex D
`xbsi1`, or in E-AC-3's `mixmdate`. It is read once, from the first `dmixmod` the programme's
independent substream sends, and the choice is printed:

```bash
forge decode surround.ec3 stereo.wav downmix=auto
```

```text
  downmix=auto: dmixmod 3 (reserved) -> Lo/Ro stereo (§D3.1.1)
```

A stream that prefers Lt/Rt gets Lt/Rt. Everything else gets Lo/Ro: a stated Lo/Ro preference,
a stream that states none (`00`, or no `dmixmod` at all), and the reserved code `11`. A/52:2018
Table D2.2 and ETSI TS 102 366 V1.4.1 Table D.1.1 both list `11` as reserved, and Annex E gives
E-AC-3's field the same table, so neither standard defines a further downmix for it; §D2.3.1.2
allows a decoder to read it as "not indicated". A later `downmix=`, `channels=1` or
`channels=as-coded` on the same command line replaces `auto`.

`drcmode=` selects §7.7's two named consumer modes, each of which sets dialnorm normalisation
*and* which of `dynrng`/`compr` applies — unlike `drc=` and `heavy`, which are the individual
switches:

```bash
forge decode programme.ec3 out.wav channels=2 drcmode=line   # §7.7.1
forge decode programme.ec3 out.wav channels=2 drcmode=rf     # §7.7.2, overload-protected
```

`drcmode=line` puts dialogue at −31 dBFS. `drcmode=rf` applies each `compr` word with 11 dB on
top, which puts dialogue at −20 dBFS, and plays any syncframe without a `compr` word at line
mode's level — the same as the Dolby Reference Player's RF mode (see
[RF mode's level](../../library/decoding.md#rf-modes-level)).

AC-4 has a different model (ETSI TS 103 190-1 clauses 5.7.8 and 5.7.9): the decoder takes the stream's
dialnorm to an output level the system supplies, cutting or boosting by
2^((output level − dialnorm) / 6), and compresses in one of the DRC decoder modes the stream
configures. `output-level=<dBFS>` sets that level; without it `decode` writes the coded level.
At an output level, `drcmode=` names the mode: `default` (the default) takes the one Table 161
gives the level (home theatre from −31 to −27 dBFS, flat panel TV from −26 to −17, portable
speakers from −16 to 0), `home-theatre`, `flat-panel-tv`, `portable-speakers` and
`portable-headphones` name one, and `off` applies the level alone:

```bash
forge decode stream.ac4 out.wav output-level=-31                  # home theatre
forge decode stream.ac4 out.wav output-level=-14 drcmode=portable-headphones
forge decode stream.ac4 out.wav output-level=-24 drcmode=off      # the level, no compression
```

`headphones` says the listener is on headphones: at an output level in the portable range,
`drcmode=default` takes portable headphones rather than portable speakers, and of a stream's
presentations one rendered for headphones before it was encoded comes first.

`dialogue-enhancement=<dB>` raises the dialogue where the stream sends dialogue enhancement
parameters (clause 5.7.8), from 0 (the default, which leaves the output alone) to 12 dB, and never
beyond the cap the stream sets, 3, 6, 9 or 12 dB.

`channels=` and `downmix=` fold AC-4 by clause 6.2.17's matrices with the stream's own mix gains:
`downmix=loro`, `ltrt` and `mono` as named, and `downmix=auto`, or `channels=2` alone, the method
the stream's `preferred_dmx_method` names (Lo/Ro where it names none). Lt/Rt takes its Pro Logic
II form where the stream prefers that; there is no 90-degree phase shift, which in AC-4 describes
processing before encoding. The LFE goes into the fold at the stream's `lfe_mixgain`, which
`mix-lfe=off` leaves out, and a 7.X stream folds to 5.X on the way. `channels=5.1` stops there: a
7.X stream's extra pair folded into its 5.X channels by Table 219, and any other stream as coded.

```bash
forge decode stream.ac4 out.wav channels=2 mix-lfe=off   # Lo/Ro or Lt/Rt without the LFE
forge decode stream_71.ac4 out.wav channels=5.1
```

`monitor` takes all of the same tokens, and additionally folds on its own initiative when the
output device renders fewer channels than the programme: playing 5.1 on a stereo endpoint
otherwise means whatever the platform's shared-mode mixer averages together, with none of the
stream's levels and none of §7.8.1's normalisation. An explicit `channels=`/`downmix=` always
wins, and a backend that cannot report its endpoint width leaves the audio alone.

### AC-4 presentations: `presentation=`, `language=`, `associated=`

An AC-4 stream can carry several presentations of its substreams: music and effects with the
dialogue in one language or another, the main audio with audio description, and so on (ETSI TS 103
190-2 clause 4.8). `decode` decodes one of them, and `monitor`, `play`, `qc`, `levels`, `loudness`
and `transcode` choose theirs the same way, with the same options. `presentation=<n>` names it by
its position in the
table of contents and `presentation-id=<id>` by its `presentation_id`, which stays with the
presentation as the table of contents changes over time; otherwise `language=<BCP 47 tag>` and
`associated=<service>` say
what the listener wants, and `decode` takes the presentation that best meets them, the language
first, then the associated audio. With neither it takes the first presentation without associated
audio. A presentation the decoder cannot decode, one the stream disables, and one above the
decoder's compatibility level (`md_compat`) are never chosen, and the status output names the
presentation decoded:

```bash
forge decode broadcast.ac4 out.wav language=de
forge decode broadcast.ac4 out.wav associated=audio-description
forge decode broadcast.ac4 out.wav presentation-id=3
```

`associated=` takes `visually-impaired`, `hearing-impaired` and `commentary` (ETSI TS 103 190-1
Table 91's associated audio), and Table 92's services: `audio-description`,
`audio-description-subtitles`, `spoken-subtitles` and `emergency-information`.

`md-compat=<0..7>` sets the compatibility level the decoder claims, 3 by default: a presentation
whose `md_compat` is above it is not chosen (ETSI TS 103 190-2 Table 55).

A presentation of several substreams is mixed as ETSI TS 103 190-1 clause 6.2.16 gives, with the
stream's own gains and pans. `dialogue-gain=<dB>` sets the dialogue against the music and effects,
up to the maximum the stream allows (0 dB where it allows none, and at most 12), and
`associated-gain=<dB>`, 0 or less, the associated audio, except where the stream says that audio
was mixed in before encoding:

```bash
forge decode broadcast.ac4 out.wav language=en dialogue-gain=6
forge decode broadcast.ac4 out.wav associated=audio-description associated-gain=-6
```

### AC-4 immersive: `speakers=` and `decoding=`

An AC-4 stream in 7.0.4 or 7.1.4 carries its channels in the immersive channel element, and says
which of them its source had: DEE's 5.1.4 streams are 7.1.4 streams whose back channels are
silent. `decode` writes the source's layout, 5.1.4 for those, and `speakers=` renders the element
to another by the channel renderer of ETSI TS 103 190-2 clause 5.10.2, with the stream's custom
downmix gains and its loudness correction for that layout: `5.1`, `5.1.2`, `5.1.4`, `7.1`, `7.1.2`
or `7.1.4`, the LFE where the stream has one. `channels=2`, `channels=1` and `downmix=` go by the
renderer's 5.1 to the stereo fold above, and win over `speakers=`:

```bash
forge decode film_514.ac4 out.wav                     # 5.1.4, the source's layout
forge decode film_514.ac4 out.wav speakers=5.1        # the heights into the fronts and sides
forge decode film_514.ac4 out.wav speakers=7.1.4      # the silent backs as well
```

`decoding=core` decodes the element's core instead, 5.1.2, as a low-complexity decoder does (clause
4.7): the back channels folded into the sides and each top pair into one top channel, with less of
A-CPL's and A-JCC's work. Core decoding renders to 5.1.2 and 5.1 alone, so `speakers=` with top
channels gives 5.1.2 and without them 5.1. The other channel elements decode alike in both modes.

### AC-4 objects

An AC-4 presentation of object audio, A-JOC or direct-coded objects, decodes to objects, each
with the position and gain its metadata sets. `decode` renders them to speakers through the layout
renderer Hearth plays E-AC-3's objects with: each object panned from its position and moving as its
metadata moves it, to the layout `speakers=`, `channels=` or `downmix=` names, and to 7.1.4 without
one. `decoding=core` decodes an A-JOC substream's core instead, its downmix signals as the objects.
An intermediate spatial format is rendered by the decoder itself (ETSI TS 103 190-2 clause 5.10.3),
to the same layouts.

```bash
forge decode ajoc.ac4 out.wav                   # 7.1.4
forge decode ajoc.ac4 out.wav speakers=5.1      # 5.1
forge decode ajoc.ac4 out.wav channels=2        # two channels
forge decode ajoc.ac4 out.wav decoding=core     # the downmix's signals as the objects
```

`decode`'s objects directory and ADM output take an AC-4 stream's objects as they take E-AC-3's,
beside the rendered file: `objects_dir` gets each object's own decoded PCM as `object_NN.wav`, and
`adm_out` (needs `-DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`, as for E-AC-3) an ADM BWF master of every bed and
dynamic object with the properties (Annex F) it decoded, its bed and LFE objects on their
speakers and the dynamic ones on their own timelines. The status output says how many objects it
wrote. A presentation without objects writes no `object_NN.wav`, and an `adm_out` on it draws a
warning.

Each format's decode reads options the other's does not. Given an AC-4 stream, `decode` names
the AC-3 and E-AC-3 ones it was given (`drc=`, `heavy`, `ltrt-phase=`, `fast-imdct`, `mode=`,
`programme=`, `bed-only`, `joc-domain=`) in a warning and ignores them, and given an AC-3 or
E-AC-3 stream it does the same with AC-4's (`output-level=`, `dialogue-enhancement=`,
`presentation=`, `presentation-id=`, `language=`, `associated=`, `dialogue-gain=`,
`associated-gain=`, `headphones`, `md-compat=` and AC-4's `drcmode=` names). The options that
promise what the other format cannot give stop the run: `bap-census=` and `verify-objects` for
AC-4, and `channels=5.1` and `syntax-trace=` for AC-3 and E-AC-3.

```text
warning: stream.ac4 is AC-4: heavy is AC-3's and E-AC-3's, and ignored
```

### Damaged frames: `conceal=`

`decode`, `monitor` and `spatial` stop on a frame that will not decode. `conceal=` substitutes
audio for it instead, reconstructed from the previous block's overlap so there is no discontinuity
at either join:

```bash
forge decode recovered.ac3 out.wav conceal=repeat   # repeat-and-fade
forge decode recovered.ac3 out.wav conceal=mute     # window-ramped silence
```

Either way the run reports how many frames or access units were concealed. Off by default: a
decode that hides a damaged frame looks exactly like one that had nothing to hide. See
[Decoding → Concealing it instead](../../library/decoding.md#concealing-it-instead-decoderconfigconcealment).

`decode` takes `conceal=` for AC-4 too. A concealed AC-4 frame is the last good frame's spectrum
again, faded 20 dB for each 32 ms lost as the AC-3 and E-AC-3 decoders fade, or silence, through
the decoder's own transform and output stages; the QMF-domain tools pass it through. The frames
that wait for an I-frame after a change of source, which otherwise write nothing, are concealed
the same way. A frame that fails before any frame has decoded still stops the run.

#### `probe` — what the stream says about itself

Every other inspection here goes through the audio: `levels` and `qc` decode the whole
programme to measure it, and `decode` reports an object count on its way past. `probe` asks
the other question — what the bitstream *declares* — and answers it without reconstructing a
single sample:

```bash
forge probe programme.ec3
```

```text

It reads a stream in two tiers, and the distinction is the point. The **header tier** —
syncinfo plus the whole of bsi — answers for every syncframe whether or not its audio is
readable, so a stream this decoder refuses is still described in full. The **parse tier** runs
the real decoder with the inverse transform switched off, which is where the `dynrng` words,
the EMDF payload ids, the object layer and the per-block tool usage come from. A syncframe the
parse tier declines is counted and reported (`parse errors` in the table, `parse_failures` in the
JSON); the header tier's answers for it stand. On a stream the decoder reads throughout, such as
`testdata/external-baseline/eac3-51-256/dee.ec3`, the parse tier accepts every syncframe and
the tool lines show what the encoder used: coupling, spectral extension and AHT there.

**Exit code** is 0 only when every syncframe passed its CRC *and* the parser accepted it, so
`probe` works as a pipeline gate without anything having to read its output:

```bash
forge probe delivery.ec3 || echo "stream is not clean"
```

Every failure exits `1`, an unreadable file or bytes that are no stream among them; the `2` that
[Exit codes](#exit-codes) gives an input problem is not what `probe` returns.

Memory is flat in the length of a bare AC-3 or E-AC-3 stream: input is pulled through a fixed
window rather than loaded, and the per-frame dump is written as the walk produces it. Probing a
two-hour file costs what probing a two-second one does. `-` in place of the path reads the stream
from stdin, so `probe` sits in a pipe. An AC-4 stream and a container are read whole before they
are walked, so their memory grows with the file.

##### Per-frame and per-block detail

`detail=frames` adds one entry per access unit — byte offset, size, timestamp, and each
syncframe's own header, CRC state and object layer. `detail=blocks` adds every block's coding
tools and exponent strategies underneath: the C++ counterpart of `tools/references/eac3_parse.py`,
and what a codec bug report actually needs.

```bash
forge probe programme.ec3 detail=blocks
```

```text
access unit 0 @ 0 (768 bytes, t=0.0000s)
  independent id 0 @ 0: 768 bytes, 2/0 stereo, crc ok, dialnorm -31 dB
    blk 0: cpl+dither+remat             exp [D45 D45 cpl:D45]
    blk 1: cpl+dither                   exp [D15 D15 cpl:D15]
    blk 2: cpl+dither                   exp [reuse reuse cpl:reuse]
```

##### JSON output (`json=1`)

`json=1` emits the same walk as a JSON document instead. The schema is a **stable contract** —
sibling tooling is built on it (an HLS/DASH manifest check comparing a `dec3` box against the
real substream map is the natural next consumer), so the rules below are commitments, not
description.

```bash
forge probe programme.ec3 json=1
```

The switch is the `json=1` token. There is no `--json`: a bare token the command line does not
recognise as an option is taken for a positional argument and never read, so
`forge probe programme.ec3 --json` exits 0 and prints the table.

**Versioning.** The top-level `schema` member names the contract: `"iclforge.probe/1"`. Within
one version, members are only ever *added*; an existing member never changes its type, its units
or its meaning, and never disappears. A member that does not apply to a given stream is present
and `null` (or `false`/`[]`), never omitted — a consumer must not have to tell "no such key"
apart from "no such thing". A change that would break any of that changes the version.

**Ordering.** `access_units` is written *before* `stream`, because the summary is only complete
once every unit has been walked and the per-frame dump has to stream. JSON member order carries
no meaning, so this costs a consumer nothing — but do not build anything that depends on the
opposite order.

**Units.** `dialnorm_db`/`dialnorm2_db` are reported in **dB** (negative), not as the
transmitted 1..31 code — the field means −1..−31 dB LKFS and that is what a delivery spec is
written in. `compr`, `compr2`, `dynrng` and `dynrng2` are the raw 8-bit words, because their
meaning is a non-linear gain curve (§7.7) and a *range* of gains is not a well-defined thing to
report. `bitrate_kbps` is measured over the whole stream; `nominal_bitrate_kbps` is AC-3's
declared Table 5.18 rate and is `null` for E-AC-3, which has no such field.

Top level:

| Member | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|

| `generator` | string | The `forge` version that wrote it |
| `file` | string | The input path as given |
| `container` | object or `null` | What a Matroska, MP4 or MPEG-TS input says of its audio track; `null` for a bare stream |
| `access_units` | array | Present only with `detail=` — see below |
| `stream` | object | The summary |

`container`, for a container input: `format` (`"matroska"`, `"mp4"` or `"mpegts"`), `codec_id` (the
Matroska CodecID or MP4 sample entry, such as `"A_EAC3"`, `"ec-3"` or `"ac-4"`; `null` for
MPEG-TS), `track`, `language`, `samples`, `sample_rate_hz` and `channels` (each `null` where the
container does not state it, as MPEG-TS does not), and two members of which the one for another
format is `null`. `mp4`: `timescale`, `movie_timescale`, `edits` and `codec_box`, the sample
entry's `dac3`, `dec3` or `dac4` as `type`, `bytes`, `fscod`, `bsid`, `bsmod`, `bsmod_label`,
`acmod`, `lfeon`, `bit_rate_code`, `data_rate_kbps`, `independent_substreams`, `num_dep_sub`,
`chan_loc`, `asvc`, `asvc_label` and `complexity_index` (a `dac4` reads as zero in the fields that
are AC-3's and E-AC-3's, and `null` for the complexity index where the box sends none).
`mpegts`: `program_number`, `pmt_pid`, `stream_type`, `signalling`, `packet_size` and `service`,
the decoded AC-3 or E-AC-3 descriptor (`bsmod`, `bsmod_present`, `full_service`, `bsid`, `mainid`,
`priority`, `asvc`, `mix_metadata`), `null` where the stream has none. Hearth's media
information writes the same `codec_box` members.

`access_units[]` (with `detail=`): `index`, `byte_offset`, `bytes`, `start_seconds`, and
`syncframes[]` — each with its own `byte_offset`, `bytes`, `stream_type`, `substream_id`,

`authenticity_tag`, `parse_error` and `objects`. With `detail=blocks` each syncframe also carries
`frame_tools` (Table E1.3's frame-level gates, `aht_streams`, `snroffststr`,
`per_block_exp_strategy`) and `blocks[]` — per block: `parsed`, `coupling`,
`enhanced_coupling`, `spectral_extension`, `block_switch` and `dither` (per-channel bit masks),
`rematrixing`, `delta_bit_alloc`, `skip_field`, `skip_bytes`, `exponent_strategy` (one entry per
coded channel, LFE last) and `coupling_exponent_strategy`.

##### AC-4

`probe` auto-detects AC-4 (`iclforge::ac4`) by its first byte — `0xAC` rather than AC-3/
E-AC-3's `0x0B` — so `forge probe stream.ac4` needs no extra flag, and works on `-` (stdin) the
same way. It reads the sync frame, table of contents, presentation and substream-group framing —
channel-coded, A-JOC-coded, direct-coded-object and OAMD substream groups alike — and has every
frame read by the decoder (`iclforge::ac4`) without decoding its audio, for what only the
substreams carry: each presentation as the decoder sees it, and the metadata of the one it would
decode. There is no `detail=frames`/`detail=blocks` equivalent (see
[Verification](../../verification.md#ac-4) for what the inspector's reading does and does not
cover, including the narrower evidence behind the A-JOC/object/OAMD path).

```bash
forge probe testdata/external-baseline/ac4-51-film-96/dee.ac4
```

That is a stream DEE encoded, committed with the tests:

`frame rate` is Part 1 Tables 83 and 84's, with the frame length and the rate a frame is coded
at; `I-frames` counts the frames whose substreams need nothing from an earlier one, and the
spacing between them; `splices` counts the frames whose `sequence_counter` does not continue the
stream, where a decoder forgets what it held.

`json=1` writes `stream.codec == "ac4"` and a dedicated `stream.ac4` object — deliberately not
the AC-3/E-AC-3 `stream` shape above with its acmod/bsmod/numblkscod/etc. fields nulled out one
by one. Those fields belong to a different codec family and do not apply; `stream.ac4` is
additive to the schema, and a consumer branches on `stream.codec` first the way any
discriminated-union JSON shape is read. `stream.ac4`: `bitstream_version`, `sample_rate_hz`,
`frame_rate_index`, `n_presentations`, `substream_groups[]`, and `presentations_v0[]` for the
legacy `bitstream_version <= 1` path (empty for every stream observed so far — see the
Verification link above). Each `presentations_v0[]` entry carries `presentation_version` and
`substreams[]`, whose entries are a `chan` substream's members (below) with its `role` beside
them. Each `substream_groups[]` entry carries `b_substreams_present`,
`b_channel_coded`, `oamd` (null unless the group is object-coded and carries an OAMD substream:
`b_oamd_ndot`, `substream_index` and `oamd_common_data`, below), and `substreams[]`. Each
`presentations_v0[]` entry also carries
`decoded`, the decoder's reading of it, with the members of a `presentations_v1[]` entry (below).
Each substream entry is a tagged union —
`kind` (`"chan"`, `"ajoc"` or `"obj"`) says which one of `chan`/`ajoc`/`obj` is non-null, the
other two `null`:
- `chan`: `channel_mode`, `channel_mode_name`, `ch_mode`, `bitrate_kbps`, `substream_index`,
  `original_content` (`b_4_back_channels_present`/`b_centre_present`/`top_channels_present` —
  whether channels `channel_mode` implies exist are real content or encoded silence, e.g. a 5.1.4
  source carried in a 7.1.4-coded substream).
- `ajoc`: `b_lfe`, `b_static_dmx`, `n_fullband_dmx_signals`, `static_objects[]`,
  `oamd_common_data` (below), `n_fullband_upmix_signals`, `upmix_objects[]`, `sf_multiplier`,
  `bitrate_kbps`, `substream_index`.
- `obj`: `objects[]`, `b_dynamic_objects`, `sf_multiplier`, `bitrate_kbps`, `substream_index`.
- Every object list entry (`static_objects`/`upmix_objects`/`objects`) is `{kind: "bed"|"dyn"|
  "isf", lfe, ajoc_coded}`.

The decoder's reading adds, after those:

- `frame_rate`: `fps`, `frame_length` and `internal_sample_rate_hz`; `bitrate_kbps`, over the
  whole stream; `iframes` and `iframe_interval_frames` (`min` and `max`, null for fewer than two
  I-frames); `splices`.
- `presentations_v1[]`, one per presentation of the last frame's table of contents: `index`,
  `presentation_id`, `presentation_version`, `presentation_config`, `md_compat`, `enabled`,
  `alternative`, `pre_virtualized`, `name`, `language`, `channels` (the speakers it decodes to,
  `L`, `R`, `C`, `LFE`, `Ls`, `Rs` and so on), `substream_groups`, `decodable`, `selectable`, and
  `members[]`: `substream`, `role` (`main`, `music_and_effects`, `dialogue`,
  `dialogue_enhancement` or `associated`), `group`, `content_classifier`, `language`, `channels`.
- `selected_presentation`: the index of the presentation the decoder would decode by default, null
  where it would decode none.
- `metadata`, that presentation's as the stream sent it up to its last frame: `presentation` (its
  index), `loudness` (`dialnorm_dbfs` and
  Part 1 clause 4.3.12.3's further values, each null where the stream sends none), `drc`
  (`eac3_profile`, `modes[]` with each decoder mode's output level range and how it compresses,
  `applied_mode`), `dialogue_enhancement` (`method`, `left`, `right`, `centre`, `max_gain_db`) and
  `downmix` (the Lo/Ro and Lt/Rt centre and surround gains, `lfe_db`, `preferred`, the loudness
  corrections), each null where the stream sends none.

An A-JOC substream's `oamd_common_data()` (§6.2.8.1), present when its
`b_oamd_common_data_present` flag is set, is read as part of the table of contents, and `probe`
reports it as `oamd_common_data` on the substream's entry. A group's own OAMD substream
(`oamd_substream()`, §6.2.2.4, which an object group can have, direct-coded or A-JOC) carries a
second `oamd_common_data()`: the decoder reads it from the frame, and `probe` reports
the first one the substream sends as `oamd_common_data` on the group's `oamd` member. Both are the
same object: `b_default_screen_size_ratio`, `master_screen_size_ratio_code` (null with the default
ratio), `b_bed_object_chan_distribute`, and a flag for each of the optional `trim()`,
`bed_render_info()` and `headphone()` of its `add_data`, `trim_present`, `bed_render_info_present`
and `headphone_present`, without their own fields. Either is null where the stream sends none. The
rest of an OAMD substream's payload, its timing and each object's metadata, is not reported.

`stream.integrity` has the same four members as the AC-3/E-AC-3 shape: `crc_valid`,
`crc_failures`, `parse_failures` and `first_parse_error`. Two of them hold something different
here. `crc_valid` is a boolean, true when no sync frame failed its CRC, where AC-3/E-AC-3 give the
number of syncframes that passed. `parse_failures` is 0 or 1, because the walk keeps only the
first error; `first_parse_error` names that error (`truncated`, `lost_sync` or
`unsupported_bitstream_version`) and is `null` when there was none. **Exit code** follows the same
rule as AC-3/E-AC-3: 0 only when every sync frame's CRC passed and every frame parsed.

`qc` is `loudness`'s bitstream-aware counterpart: `loudness` measures a *source* WAV before encoding, `qc` measures what a stream actually *delivers* after encoding and decoding it back, and checks that against what the stream's own metadata claims:

```bash
forge qc programme.ec3
```

```text
qc: programme.ec3 (E-AC-3, 3/2 + LFE, 48000 Hz, 938 access unit(s), 30.02 s)
  layout=bed  (BS.1770 Annex 1, Table 3 weights over the Table 5.8 bed)
measured (BS.1770-4 gated / EBU Tech 3342 / BS.1770-4 Annex 2):
  integrated loudness    -22.87 LKFS
  loudness range          4.31 LU
  true peak               -1.62 dBTP
embedded metadata:
  dialnorm              24  (claims dialogue at -24.00 LKFS)
  compr                absent
dialnorm check:
  claimed                -24.00 LKFS  (from dialnorm 24)
  delta                   +1.13 dB    (measured - claimed; positive = measured is louder)
  measurement-derived dialnorm would be 23, not 24
```

Add `preset=<name>` (or `preset=all`) to gate that same measurement against a named delivery spec instead of just reporting it — see [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#qc-options-qc-preset-layout-objects) for the exact preset numbers and the primary source cited for each, and this page's own exit-code note below. The presets are `ebu-r128-s2`, `atsc-a85`, `atsc-a85-streaming`, `netflix` and `apple-music-atmos`; each verdict prints the document version and date it was judged against.

`layout=` chooses which soundfield is metered. The default, `layout=bed`, measures the independent substream's own Table 5.8 bed through BS.1770 Annex 1's basic algorithm — which is all `qc` has ever measured, and on an Atmos or 7.1.4 stream that leaves every dependent substream's height, wide and rear channel out. It now says so rather than reporting the bed as though it were the whole programme. `layout=rendered` measures the assembled program instead, through BS.1770-5 (11/2023) Annex 3's extended algorithm, which weights each channel by its position and so has a weight for every Table E2.5 location:

```bash
forge qc atmos.ec3 layout=rendered preset=apple-music-atmos
```

```text
qc: atmos.ec3 (E-AC-3, L C R Ls Rs Lrs Rrs Vhl Vhr Lts Rts LFE, 48000 Hz, 62 access unit(s), 1.98 s)
  layout=rendered  (BS.1770-5 Annex 3, weighted by channel position)
```

For a plain 5.1 stream both settings give the same number, by construction — see [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#layoutbed-default-and-layoutrendered) for the weighting table and the one Table 5.8 layout where the two algorithms disagree.

Neither `layout=` setting sees a dynamic object's own *position* — both meter channels, and this project's own encoder folds every object onto the flat 5.1 ring at encode time regardless of where it was authored. `objects=<layout>` re-renders a dynamic-object-only programme's objects by their own OAMD position instead, onto a chosen layout, per ITU-R BS.1770-5 Annex 4:

```bash
forge qc atmos.ec3 objects=514
```

```text
qc: atmos.ec3 (E-AC-3, 3/2 + LFE, 48000 Hz, 62 access unit(s), 1.98 s)
  layout=bed  (BS.1770 Annex 1, Table 3 weights over the Table 5.8 bed)
  ...
  objects=5.1.4  (BS.1770-5 Annex 4: objects re-rendered by their own OAMD
  position, via iclforge::spatial's direction panner, then Annex 3)
```

See [Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#objectslayout) for why this needs a dynamic-object-only programme and what a bed-and-objects one gets instead. It reads an E-AC-3 stream's JOC objects: `qc` given `objects=` with an AC-4 stream refuses the run (exit `1`), and an AC-3 stream is refused too (exit `2`). `layout=` and `preset=` work on AC-4 as on the other two.

`qc`'s exit code is 0 only when the file decodes cleanly **and** (if a preset was given) every requested gate passes, which is what makes it usable as an actual CI/pipeline QC step: `forge qc out.ec3 preset=ebu-r128-s2 || echo "loudness QC failed"`. With no `preset=` at all it only ever measures and reports (no verdict to fail), so a plain `forge qc <file>` is non-zero solely on an input error. The two non-zero halves are now distinct: `6` means a gate failed (a result), `2` means the stream could not be read (a fault) — see [Exit codes](#exit-codes) below, so a pipeline can react differently to each:

```bash
forge qc out.ec3 preset=ebu-r128-s2
case $? in
  0) echo "in spec" ;;
  6) echo "out of spec" ;;
  *) echo "qc could not run at all" ;;
esac
```

### Stream tools — an encoded stream in, an encoded stream out

Everything above takes PCM. These five take an already-encoded AC-3/E-AC-3 elementary stream
(`transcode` AC-4 too), and four of them never touch a coded coefficient at all.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `transcode` | Decode and re-encode. The only one here that re-encodes, because DD+ and DD are different codecs and nothing else bridges them — the route to an optical link or an AC-3-only HDMI sink, which had no route at all before. It also goes between AC-4 and AC-3 or E-AC-3, either way — see [below](#transcode-and-ac-4) |
| `metadata` | Rewrite `dialnorm`, `compr`, `bsmod`, `dsurmod` on an existing stream and re-stamp its CRCs. The audio bytes are copied through untouched |
| `normalize` | The measurement-driven case of the above: decode to measure BS.1770-4 integrated loudness, write the `dialnorm` ATSC A/85 §8 implies, change nothing else |
| `cut` | Extract on access-unit boundaries |
| `cat` | Join streams end to end |

```bash
forge transcode programme.ec3 programme.ac3 448
```

```bash
forge metadata programme.ac3 delivered.ac3 dialnorm=24 bsmod=2
```

`transcode` carries the source's metadata across rather than resetting it:

- **`dialnorm`** verbatim. §5.4.2.8 says it "shall affect the sound reproduction level", so a
  transcode that reset it to 31 would play a programme up to 30 dB loud on a levelled system.
  `dialnorm=<n>` or `dialnorm=auto` overrides it. `<n>` is written verbatim; `auto` measures the
  source with the same BS.1770 pass `normalize` makes, not the routed or folded output. The
  encoders do not write the value 0, which §5.4.2.8 reserves, so a source carrying it in
  `dialnorm` or `dialnorm2` stops with an error until `dialnorm=` or `dialnorm2=` names a value.
- **`compr`** verbatim — the source's own 8-bit word is stamped back onto each encoded frame
  rather than re-derived. §7.7.2's ceiling describes the *programme*, not this generation's
  coding. Passing `heavy` asks for a freshly derived one instead.
- **The mix metadata**, converted: AC-3 carries two coarse levels in `bsi` and E-AC-3 carries the
  richer `mixmdate` group, so crossing between them maps the Lo/Ro pair (or the Lt/Rt pair, when
  `dmixmod` says that is the intended downmix) onto the nearest level the target format has, by
  linear coefficient rather than by table position. `dmixmod` and the LFE mix level carry across
  as they are.
- **`dynrng`** does not carry. It is a per-*block* word derived from the signal, with no `bsi`
  field to stamp it into the way `compr` has, so a re-encode has to produce its own — pass
  `drc=<profile>` for that. The command reports what the source carried, so the difference is
  visible rather than discovered.

A layout AC-3 cannot code (7.1, 5.1.4, 7.1.4) folds down to 5.1 per §7.8 using the mix levels
just carried across, and says so on stderr — it is a real change to what the listener hears, not
a detail. The output codec comes from the output name's suffix (`.ac3`/`.ec3`/`.ac4`);
`codec=ac3|eac3|ac4` covers stdout and any name the suffix cannot speak for. The input may be a
Matroska, MP4 or MPEG-TS container, as for `decode`.

#### `transcode` and AC-4

An AC-4 source becomes one programme: the presentation `presentation=`, `presentation-id=`,
`language=` and `associated=` choose, as [`decode`](#ac-4-presentations-presentation-language-associated)
chooses one, its substreams mixed at `dialogue-gain=` and `associated-gain=`. It is decoded as
coded, with no output level and so no DRC, because ETSI TS 103 190-1 clause 5.7.9.4 asks a
transcoder to apply none and to hand the AC-3 or E-AC-3 encoder the DRC profile the stream names
for it instead (`drc_eac3_profile`; `libs/ac4/ERRATA.md` records why that is the field the
clause means). What carries:

- **`dialnorm`**, to the dB: AC-4 sends it in steps of 0.25 dB, AC-3 and E-AC-3 in whole dB, so
  -23.5 dBFS becomes 24. `dialnorm=<n>` and `dialnorm=auto` override it, `auto` measuring the
  presentation as coded.
- **The DRC profile.** `drc_eac3_profile`'s film standard, film light, music standard, music
  light or speech becomes the re-encode's `drc=`, which computes its `dynrng`; its "None" and the
  reserved values mean none. `drc=<profile>` overrides it.
- **The downmix values.** The Lo/Ro and Lt/Rt centre and surround gains become E-AC-3's mixing
  metadata (a surround gain of 0 dB, which E-AC-3's table reserves, goes to -1.5 dB), or AC-3's
  two `bsi` levels from the pair the stream prefers; Lt/Rt for Pro Logic II, which A/52 has no
  code for, goes as Lt/Rt; and the LFE's gain, in AC-4's half-dB steps, goes half a dB up to
  E-AC-3's whole dB.

A 7.X presentation keeps its last pair in E-AC-3, at the Table E2.5 locations AC-4's speakers
have: the back pair as `Lrs`/`Rrs`, the wides as `Lw`/`Rw` and the top front pair as `Vhl`/`Vhr`.
AC-3 has none of them, so for AC-3 the element folds to 5.X as AC-4 folds it (TS 103 190-1 Table
219), and `channels=5.1` asks for that fold for E-AC-3 too. A `[layout]` argument is routed from
the decoded channels as it is from a WAV file.

The other way, an AC-3 or E-AC-3 source's `dialnorm` goes to AC-4 in whole dB, and its downmix
values to AC-4's (Part 2 clause 6.2.9's custom downmix data) where the output is 5.X: E-AC-3's
mixing metadata and AC-3's Annex D levels are the same values AC-4's tables hold, AC-3's two
`bsi` levels become the Lo/Ro pair, `dmixmod` the preferred downmix, and the LFE's whole dB goes
half a dB down to AC-4's steps, so the two directions undo each other. The source's `dynrng` and
`compr` words name no profile, so the AC-4 stream sends DRC only when `drc=<profile>` names one.
AC-4's encoder takes mono, stereo, 5.0 and 5.1 at 48 or 44.1 kHz: a source of 3/0 to 3/2 without
an LFE becomes 5.0, a wider one folds to 5.1 per §7.8, and 1+1 (two programmes AC-4 would need two
presentations for), 32 kHz, and the AC-3 and E-AC-3 options with no AC-4 counterpart (`heavy`,
`drc2=`, `dialnorm2=`, `mixmeta`, `infomdat`, `annexd`) are refused. The bitrate defaults to 192
kbps for AC-4 and 448 for AC-3 and E-AC-3.

```bash
forge transcode broadcast.ac4 optical.ac3 448 language=en
forge transcode programme.ec3 programme.ac4 256 drc=film-light
```

`cut` and `cat` move whole access units — an E-AC-3 access unit being an independent substream
*plus its dependents*, never one syncframe. A start time inside a unit names that whole unit; a
cut is never a split. That makes the round trip exact:

```bash
forge cut programme.ac3 head.ac3 0 0.512
forge cut programme.ac3 tail.ac3 0.512
forge cat rejoined.ac3 head.ac3 tail.ac3
cmp programme.ac3 rejoined.ac3   # identical
```

`cat` takes its **output first**, unlike every other command here, because the input list is
variadic. It refuses inputs whose codec, sample rate, coding mode, LFE presence, rendered
channel count or substream-per-unit count differ from the first — a decoder walking the join has
no way to be told the format changed.

**Out of scope for all five:** `strmtyp 2` convertible streams — the spec's own no-re-encode
path to AC-3 — which `iclforge::ac3::plan::validate` already refuses. Nothing here produces or consumes
one.

**AC-4 and the four that copy.** `metadata`, `normalize`, `cut` and `cat` frame AC-3 and E-AC-3
syncframes and do not read AC-4: given an AC-4 stream they stop with exit `2` (`lost sync:
expected 0x0B77`). `strip-objects` refuses an AC-4 stream the way it refuses AC-3 (exit `2`, only
Annex E frames can carry an object layer).

**What `metadata` cannot do:** only fields already on the wire can change. `compr` lives behind
`compre` and E-AC-3's `bsmod`/`dsurmod` behind `infomdate`; a stream that did not transmit one
has no bits to overwrite, and inserting them would re-frame the syncframe, which is a re-encode
by another name. Such a request is refused with a reason rather than half-applied. This
project's own E-AC-3 encoder never sets `infomdate`, so `bsmod`/`dsurmod` are AC-3-only in
practice; `dsurmod` additionally exists only for coding mode 2/0 (§5.4.2.7).

### Containers

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `spdif` | Wraps AC-3, E-AC-3 or AC-4 as IEC 61937 bursts inside a playable PCM16 WAV — the stream's `bsid`, or its AC-4 sync word, decides which, and the E-AC-3 carrier runs at four times the content sample rate. AC-4 goes in IEC 61937-14's bursts, the smallest of AC-4, AC-4 HBR4 and AC-4 HBR16 that holds the stream's largest frame, on the link its frame rate gives (HBR16's as eight channels at a quarter of the link rate). For feeding a receiver through an ordinary audio path |
| `unspdif` | The inverse of `spdif`: reads IEC 61937 bursts back and writes the AC-3, E-AC-3 or AC-4 elementary stream inside them. Takes the WAV `spdif` writes, a capture of an S/PDIF or HDMI input, or a bare dump of carrier bytes with no RIFF header at all — the data type in `Pc` decides AC-3, E-AC-3 or AC-4, and both 16-bit word orders are read. Nothing is re-encoded: the output is what the source sent, byte for byte. `-` works on either end — a capture tool piped straight in, the stream piped straight out — with the report going to stderr, same convention as `encode`/`decode` |
| `mkv` | Wraps AC-3 or E-AC-3 as Matroska, reading format/packet boundaries/sample rate/channel count from the bitstream itself so the container can't be told the wrong ones. The input may itself be a container — Matroska/MP4/MPEG-TS are sniffed by content, not by name — which is what makes `mkv`/`mp4`/`ts` container-to-container remuxers as well as encode targets. AC-4 is refused: Matroska's codec specification registers no codec ID for it, and a file under one of this project's invention would be one no other reader could name |
| `mp4` | Wraps AC-3, E-AC-3 **or AC-4** as a single-file MP4/ISOBMFF (an AC-4 input takes TS 103 190-2 Annex E's `ac-4`/`dac4` path, with the Annex E.13 codecs string reported), writing a spec-correct `dac3`/`dec3` sample-entry box (fscod/bsid/bsmod/acmod/lfeon, plus the Atmos complexity-index extension for JOC content) read straight off the bitstream — never off whatever a container INPUT declared, which is the dec3-repair case: a source with a broken or missing Atmos `dec3` flag gets a correct one on the way out |
| `ts` | Wraps AC-3, E-AC-3 **or AC-4** (DVB profile only — EN 300 468 Annex D.7; `atsc` is refused for AC-4) as an MPEG-2 Transport Stream (PAT + PMT + one PES-wrapped audio PID), identified per whichever broadcast profile the optional third argument names — `dvb` (the default) or `atsc`. See below |
| `demux` | The inverse of `mkv`: reads a container and writes the bare AC-3/E-AC-3 elementary stream inside it (an AC-4 track as sync frames), which is what every other command here takes as input. The container is identified by its **own magic bytes**, never by the file name — a rip called `title00.mkv` that is really something else, or one with no extension at all, is the normal case. Unlike the wrapping commands it streams: the reader is fed in 64 KiB chunks and each access unit is written as it comes out, so peak memory is a chunk plus a frame whatever the file's duration. Matroska/WebM, MP4 (plain and fragmented) and MPEG-2 Transport Stream (188/192/204-byte packet grids; DVB, ATSC and registration-descriptor codec signalling all read). An MP4 whose `moov` follows its `mdat` is refused with an explanation rather than read wrong — that layout cannot be streamed. For MPEG-TS the destination gets the concatenated PES payloads rather than a guaranteed one-access-unit-per-payload split, since PES makes no such promise — the status line omits sample rate/channels for it, since a transport stream's PMT names the codec but not those |
| `remux` | Container-to-container in one step: `mkv`/`mp4`/`ts` under the hood, picked by `out_path`'s **extension** (`.mkv`/`.webm`, `.mp4`/`.m4a`/`.mov`, `.ts`/`.m2ts`) since a file that doesn't exist yet has no bytes to sniff. The input is still identified by its own magic bytes, exactly as `demux`'s. `[dvb\|atsc]` is passed through when the target is a Transport Stream and ignored otherwise |
| `fmp4` | Writes fragmented MP4/CMAF — an init segment plus one media segment per fragment — alongside an HLS media+master playlist pair and a DASH MPD, all pointing at the same segments, ready for a real HLS/DASH origin or packager. `[frames_per_fragment]` defaults to 48 access units per fragment, about 1.5 s at 48 kHz. Atmos content signals itself automatically and completely: `CHANNELS="<N>/JOC"` in the HLS playlists, the two `EC3_ExtensionType`/`EC3_ExtensionComplexityIndex` supplemental descriptors ETSI TS 103 420 clause D.2 defines in the MPD, and the `ceao` compatibility brand its Annex E requires on the segments. Every representation also states its channel configuration, on the Dolby scheme TS 102 366 clause I.1.2.1 defines. `fallback-51` additionally writes the paired 5.1 rendition. AC-4, bare or in MP4, is fragmented as ETSI TS 103 190-2 Annex H has a CMAF track: each fragment starts at an I-frame, the first once it holds `frames_per_fragment` frames; each sample that is not an I-frame is listed with its flags; the track counts in Table E.1's time scale (240 000 at 29.97, 59.94 and 119.88 fps); its brands are `ca4m` and `ca4s`; and the manifests carry the codecs parameter, the channel configuration (Annex G's Table G.1, or the Dolby 2015 scheme) and the frame rate of the presentation with the widest compatibility. A stream Annex H.1.2 does not allow in a CMAF track is refused, naming the rule |

#### `ts` broadcast profiles

ATSC and DVB both register AC-3/E-AC-3 for MPEG-TS carriage, with different, non-interoperable
signalling — so a stream satisfies one of them, never a bit of each:

```bash
forge ts programme.ec3 programme.ts atsc
```

| | `dvb` (default) | `atsc` |
|---|---|---|
| AC-3 `stream_type` | `0x06` (PES private data) | `0x81` (A/52 Annex A §A4.1) |
| E-AC-3 `stream_type` | `0x06` | `0x87` (A/52 Annex G §G3.1) |
| AC-3 descriptor | `AC3_descriptor`, tag `0x6A` (ETSI EN 300 468 Table D.6) | `AC-3_audio_stream_descriptor`, tag `0x81` (A/52 Table A4.1) |
| E-AC-3 descriptor | `enhanced_AC-3_descriptor`, tag `0x7A` (Table D.7) | `E-AC-3_audio_descriptor`, tag `0xCC` (A/52 Table G.1) |

Either way the descriptor's identification fields are read off the bitstream, not guessed: the
service type (`bsmod`), the channel mode and rendered channel count, the surround mode
(`dsurmod`), `bsid`, whether mixing metadata is present, and which independent substreams the
stream uses. Two values are not in any bitstream, because they describe how services in a
multiplex *relate* rather than what one stream contains, so they are omitted unless given —
and checked against the stream's own `bsmod` either way: `asvc=` on what Table 5.7 calls a main
service, or `mainid=` on what it calls an associated one, is a usage error rather than a
descriptor that quietly says the wrong thing.

| Option | What it says |
|---|---|
| `mainid=<0-7>` | The main-service number this service is (only valid on a **main** service) |
| `asvc=<mask>` | Which main services an **associated** service may be reproduced with, one bit each — decimal, `0xNN`, or a comma-separated list of main-service numbers (`asvc=0,2`) |

```bash
forge ts commentary.ac3 commentary.ts atsc asvc=0,2
```

Reading a `.ts` back out (`iclforge::containers::mpegts::demux`/`Reader`) decodes the same descriptor into
`ReadStream::service` — see [muxing-and-sinks.md](../../library/muxing-and-sinks.md#demuxing-iclforgecontainersmpegtsdemux-iclforgecontainersmpegtsreader)
for what does and does not survive the round trip.

### Live & hardware

Needs the platform's capture, passthrough, monitor or spatial backend — see the per-OS Platform
notes pages ([Windows](../../platforms/windows.md), [Linux](../../platforms/linux.md),
[Raspberry Pi](../../platforms/raspberry-pi.md), [macOS](../../platforms/macos.md),
[Android](../../platforms/android.md)) for what's actually confirmed against real hardware on
each OS.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `devices` | Lists capture endpoints (microphones, playback-device loopbacks) |
| `outputs` | Lists render endpoints and whether each supports AC-3/E-AC-3 passthrough |
| `identify` | Walks the identify tone across an output's speakers: pink noise on one rendered channel at a time, placed by the routing patch, so which speaker each channel reaches can be heard rather than assumed. The stream is opened at the device's own channel count and each rendered channel placed by the patch — see [`identify`](#identify-hearing-which-speaker-a-channel-reaches) below |
| `record` | Captures from a device straight to a file, metering live. `layout=`/`codec=` choose the shape (any layout up to 7.1.4, AC-3 or E-AC-3; with `codec=ac4`, AC-4 in mono, stereo, 5.0 or 5.1), `container=` the wrapper (`raw`, `mkv`, `ts`, `spdif`, `fmp4`), `watchdog=` how long a silent device is tolerated. If the endpoint turns out to be bitstreaming IEC 61937 rather than delivering PCM (an HDMI/S/PDIF capture card, or a loopback of a player set to bitstream), `record` recognises that within about a quarter of a second and writes the **elementary stream** instead of encoding the bursts as if they were audio — see [passthrough capture](#passthrough-capture) below |
| `play` | Exclusive-mode IEC 61937 passthrough of an existing file, bare or inside a container — `bsid` decides AC-3 vs. E-AC-3. When a `device_index` is named, `play` follows the sink: a source format it rejects gets transcoded to AC-3 or decoded to PCM automatically instead of refused — see [Following the sink](#following-the-sink) below. AC-4, which no receiver found takes over IEC 61937, is decoded and played as PCM, as `monitor` plays it (`follow=off`, which asks for passthrough alone, refuses it with exit `4`) |
| `monitor` | Decodes an existing file, bare or inside a container, and plays it on an ordinary, non-bitstreamed output — the shared-mode preview path. For an Atmos-mode stream, this plays the 5.1 **bed** and reports the object count found: the decoder reads TS 103 420's object layer (OAMD/JOC) but this path does not render or export objects, so this is what a legacy decoder hears, not unmixed objects — use `decode` with `objects_dir` for the object audio itself. An AC-4 stream plays the presentation `presentation=` and the rest choose, with `decode`'s output level, DRC, dialogue enhancement and downmix options; on an endpoint with fewer channels than the presentation it folds by the stream's own downmix. It plays the channels a presentation decodes to: the layout renderer that puts a presentation's objects on speakers belongs to `decode` (and to Hearth), not to `monitor` or `play`. |
| `spatial` | Decodes an E-AC-3 stream's object layer and hands the objects to the platform's spatial renderer, each at its own OAMD position — the one playback path that renders objects as objects rather than as a bed. Windows only today; see [`spatial`](#spatial-objects-on-the-platform-renderer) below |
| `live` | Capture → encode → optional live monitor and/or IEC 61937 passthrough, running continuously, still writing the file `record` always has. Everything `record` takes, plus a second clock-conformed capture device (`capture2=`), an object-slot budget and `map=` binding (`objects=`, `mode=atmos`), and a parallel 5.1 AC-3 leg for an AC-3-only receiver (`downmix=`) |

`live`'s device arguments: `monitor_device`/`passthrough_device` take `-2` (default, leaves that
leg off), `-1` (the default render endpoint), or an index from `outputs`. Either or both legs may
run alongside the file `live` always writes.

`live mode` (also shared with `atmos`): `channels` (default) encodes the captured channels onto
`layout=` — stereo by default, anything up to 7.1.4 — placing them by direction the way `encode`
places a file's; `atmos` pans capture channels into a 5.1 bed as objects, moving each one every
frame the same way `atmos`'s synthetic orbit does, unless `positions=` names a real live position
source instead — see **Live object positions over OSC** below. `layout=`/`codec=` describe a
channel session only; `mode=atmos` always encodes the TS 103 420 shape and refuses either.

**Take shape and durability.** `record` and `live` both take `layout=`, `codec=`,
`container=raw|mkv|ts|spdif|fmp4` (`cmaf` is an accepted alias for the last) and
`watchdog=<seconds>` (see
[Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#recordlive-options-record-live-container-layout-codec-watchdog)).
`codec=ac4` encodes AC-4 (ETSI TS 103 190) in mono, stereo, 5.0 (`layout=L,C,R,Ls,Rs`) or 5.1 at
48 or 44.1 kHz, with `dialnorm=` and `drc=`'s profile, an I-frame every 24 frames. `raw` writes its
sync frames with their CRC, `ts` the DVB signalling `ts` writes, `spdif` IEC 61937-14's bursts,
and `fmp4` a CMAF track fragmented at I-frames as `fmp4` fragments one; `mkv` is refused, as the
`mkv` command refuses AC-4. `live`'s monitor decodes the AC-4, and its passthrough receiver gets
the parallel 5.1 AC-3 leg below, since no receiver found takes AC-4 over IEC 61937.
All five containers are written **incrementally, as the take runs**, through the same
`RecordingSink` the GUI's own takes go through — so a take costs one frame of memory rather than
the whole session, and a crash an hour in leaves an hour of playable file. A capture device that
stops delivering audio ends the session as a failure (exit `5`) rather than leaving it looking
healthy with nothing coming in; whatever was already written stays on disk.

**Objects on a live session.** `live mode=atmos` allocates its object slots once, at session
start — `objects=<N>` sets the budget, `map=` binds capture channels to slots with the same
`obj`/`objm`/`none` grammar the Format tab's assignment table uses (see
[Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#objects-and-map-modeatmos)). A slot with nothing bound to
it is carried silent rather than changing the object count a decoder read from the first access
unit.

**Live object positions over OSC.** `positions=<scheme>:[<bind>:]<port>` (`mode=atmos`
only — refused with `mode=channels`, since there are no objects to place) swaps the built-in
synthetic orbit for a real live position source: a show-control rig, a DAW, or any OSC 1.0 sender
addressing this session's objects over UDP. The token is scheme-prefixed on purpose — only `osc`
exists today, but a MIDI source (`positions=midi:...`) or a desktop game controller
(`positions=gamepad:...`) can land as new schemes later without a grammar change. **Neither MIDI
nor gamepad is implemented yet.**

`<bind>` is `local` (the default — binds `127.0.0.1`, loopback only), `any` (binds `0.0.0.0`,
every interface — a real security-relevant choice, not just a technical one: it opens the port to
whatever else can already reach this machine, not just this process), or a dotted-quad IPv4
literal. Never a hostname — there is no DNS resolution, so starting a session never blocks waiting
for one to resolve. `<port>` is 1-65535.

```text
positions=osc:9000                 # loopback, port 9000 (the default bind)
positions=osc:any:9000             # every interface
positions=osc:192.168.1.50:9000    # bind to one specific local address
```

Once bound, the listener understands one address space, `<n>` 0-based and matching scene order:

| Address | OSC type tag | Arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `/object/<n>/xyz` | `,fff` | x, y, z (float32) — the same room-anchored axes `atmos-path`'s own scene grammar uses (see [x/y/z above](#synthesis-generate-a-stream-from-nothing) and [Library → Spatial & Atmos](../../library/spatial-and-atmos.md)) |
| `/object/<n>/gain` | `,f` | linear gain (float32), not dB |
| `/object/<n>/lfe` | `,f` | linear `lfe_send` (float32) |
| `/object/<n>/release` | `,` | no arguments — hands the object back to the orbit's own starting point |

Any other address, or a message with the wrong argument count or type, is silently dropped and
counted rather than treated as fatal to the session — a show-control rig sends plenty of traffic
this listener has no use for, and none of it should end a take. A `/gain` or `/lfe` message that
arrives before that object's first `/xyz` is held pending rather than applied or dropped, and takes
effect the moment a position follows it.

A bind failure — most often the port already in use — refuses the whole session (exit `4`,
`kExitUnavailable`) rather than silently falling back to the orbit. That is deliberate, and
different from `monitor=`/`passthrough=`: those are output legs whose absence still leaves a
correct file behind, but `positions=` is an *input* — a silent fallback would put a different
scene in the recorded file than the one asked for, discoverable only at playback.

An object nothing has addressed yet holds exactly where the orbit's own formula would have started
it at t=0 — still spread apart from its siblings (objects sharing a direction are exactly what JOC
cannot separate, which is why the orbit spreads them at all) — at this session's own gain law
(`0.7 / sqrt(N)`, the same one the orbit itself uses). A session with `positions=` on but nothing
yet addressing some of its objects therefore degrades gracefully: those objects sit still and
audible, never silent, never snapped to room centre.

Status lines at session start and end report what actually happened (the text is in
`apps/forge/cli/src/commands/live_audio.cpp`, searchable as `"positions:"`):

```text
positions: OSC on 127.0.0.1:9000, objects 0-3 (/object/<n>/xyz|gain|lfe|release)
...
positions: 812 datagrams, 796 updates applied, 12 dropped
```

**Testing it.** Any OSC 1.0 sender works — TouchOSC, a DAW's OSC output, or a few dependency-free
lines of Python:

```python
import socket, struct

def osc_xyz(obj, x, y, z):
    addr = f"/object/{obj}/xyz".encode() + b"\0"
    addr += b"\0" * (-len(addr) % 4)          # pad to a 4-byte boundary
    tags = b",fff\0\0\0\0"                    # ",fff" padded the same way
    return addr + tags + struct.pack(">fff", x, y, z)

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.sendto(osc_xyz(0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0), ("127.0.0.1", 9000))
```

```bash
forge live out.ec3 0 60 192 -2 -2 atmos positions=osc:9000
```

That starts a 60-second object session listening on loopback port 9000; the Python snippet above
moves object 0 to `x=0.8, y=0.2, z=0.0` — front-right of the room, at listener height — while it
runs.

**An AC-3-only receiver.** When the session's stream needs E-AC-3 but the chosen
`passthrough_device` only bitstreams plain AC-3, `live` sends it a parallel 5.1 AC-3 encode of the
bed the main plan already computed, while the file and the monitor still carry the full stream.
An AC-4 session's receiver always gets that leg. `downmix=off` restores the plain refusal.

### `identify` — hearing which speaker a channel reaches

Every other playback command hands audio to an output and trusts that the channels arrive where
they are meant to. `identify` is the one that checks. It plays pink noise on one rendered channel
at a time — the level an AVR's own test tone uses, and band-limited to 30–80 Hz for an LFE feed so
a subwoofer is not asked for midrange — and prints which channel and which output each burst went
to:

```bash
forge identify                       # the default endpoint, its own speakers, 2 s each
forge identify 0 7.1.4 3             # endpoint 0 from 'outputs', a 7.1.4 layout, 3 s each
forge identify 0 - 2 1,0,2,3,4,5     # the same, with the front pair swapped
forge identify 0 5.1 2 - -30         # quieter: -30 dB RMS instead of -20
```

The stream is opened at the **device's own** channel count rather than the programme's, and each
rendered channel is placed at the output a routing patch names
(`iclforge::audio::PcmOutput`, `iclforge::render::Routing`). That is what makes the check meaningful: an
eight-channel HDMI endpoint is driven as eight outputs, not as six channels for a mixer to
spread, and a channel with nowhere to go is reported as `not patched` instead of vanishing
silently.

The patch is built from the endpoint's speaker mask where the backend reports one, so a 5.1
programme on a 7.1 device lands on its front, centre, LFE and **side** pair and leaves the rear
pair silent — which is what the mask says those outputs are, and not what counting outputs from
zero would give. `layout` of `-` walks the device's own speakers; a named layout walks that
instead, which is how a narrower device shows what it cannot place.

A tone heard from a speaker other than the one the line names means the room is wired
differently from the patch. Pass a patch of your own to match it: one token per rendered channel,
each an output index or `-`.

### `spatial` — objects on the platform renderer

`spatial` decodes an E-AC-3 stream's object layer and submits each reconstructed
object to the operating system's own spatial renderer at the position its OAMD carries, instead
of folding the objects into a bed first. On Windows that renderer is
`ISpatialAudioObjectRenderStream`, reached through `iclforge::audio::SpatialObjectSink`; no other
backend in the tree implements one, so on Linux, macOS and Android the command is listed and
reports itself unavailable — the same treatment the capture and passthrough commands get where
their backends are missing (`Needs::kSpatial` in `apps/forge/cli/src/main.cpp`, answered by
`libs/audio/src/backend/<os>/audio_backend.cpp`).

```bash
forge spatial programme.ec3       # the default endpoint
forge spatial programme.ec3 2     # an index from 'forge outputs'
```

Two refusals come before anything is decoded. A plain AC-3 input is rejected because only E-AC-3
carries the object layer, with the error naming `monitor` as the command that plays an AC-3 bed;
an AC-4 input gets the same refusal (exit `2`), since `spatial` reads E-AC-3's object layer alone
and does not take AC-4's objects.
An endpoint with no spatial format enabled on it — `GetMaxDynamicObjectCount` reading zero — is
rejected with exit `4`, rather than quietly falling back to an ordinary render path: that
fallback would make `spatial` indistinguishable from `monitor` while claiming to be something
else.

Every dynamic object goes out at its own position, converted from TS 103 420 §4.2.1's
room-anchored cube to the renderer's listener-relative metres; the bed's LFE goes out as a static
object, which is the only shape it can take (§6.3.2.2 never makes the LFE a JOC output, so it is
only ever a coded channel). The axis correspondence is exact. The metre scale is not: OAMD's cube
carries no absolute size, so the room half-extents in `apps/forge/cli/src/commands/live_audio.cpp` — 2 m to
each side wall, 2 m front and back, 1 m to ceiling and floor — are a plausible small room rather
than a measured one. Moving an object moves it in the right direction by the right proportion, at
an approximate absolute distance. The session prints its object count and endpoint at the start,
and the access units played, active dynamic objects and underruns at the end.

`spatial` builds its `iclforge::ac3::DecoderConfig` from the same options `decode` and `monitor` do, so the
decode-side tokens above (`drc=`, `heavy`, `conceal=`, `fast-imdct=off`) reach it, and
`verify-objects` checks each frame's object signature here as it does there. Two do not reach it:
`run_spatial` leaves `fast-mdct=off` and `joc-domain=` out of the config it builds, so the JOC
reconstruction on this path always takes the defaults — the fast forward MDCT, in the QMF domain.

The §7.8 output-stage tokens (`channels=`, `downmix=`) have no purpose here, since what reaches
the renderer is the objects rather than a fold — and they are not safe to assume harmless either:
`run_spatial` takes the bed's LFE from the decoded channel list's last entry, and a fold replaces
that list with its own output. What such a run actually submits has not been checked, so leave
both tokens off this command.

What is confirmed against hardware and what is not is set out on the
[Windows](../../platforms/windows.md#audio-backend-wasapi) page: the sink has activated and rendered
this project's own Atmos stream against an endpoint with Windows Sonic enabled, and the
no-spatial-format refusal was confirmed against two endpoints. Nobody has yet listened and
confirmed that the objects arrive from where their positions say they should.

### Following the sink

When `play` is given a `device_index`, it first asks what that sink actually
accepts before committing to a format — its own EDID/ELD-carried CEA-861 Short Audio
Descriptors where a backend can read them (real today only on ALSA — see
[Linux](../../platforms/linux.md)), the same live probe `outputs` uses everywhere else, noted on
stderr when that fallback happens. A source format the sink rejects then gets an automatic
fallback instead of a plain refusal:

- **E-AC-3 on an AC-3-only sink** is transcoded to AC-3 first (`transcode`, run
  against a temporary file and cleaned up afterwards — dialnorm, `compr` and the mix metadata
  carry across exactly as a direct `forge transcode` call would), then that AC-3 plays the way
  a plain AC-3 source file always has. This is the "no 5.1 PCM over optical" case: an optical
  link can carry compressed AC-3 up to 640 kbit/s but never multichannel PCM, so a 5.1 E-AC-3
  source has no other way through — what used to take `forge transcode in.ec3 tmp.ac3 448`
  followed by `forge play tmp.ac3 <device_index>` is now one command.
- **A sink that bitstreams neither AC-3 nor E-AC-3** falls back to decoded PCM instead —
  `forge monitor`'s own path, which folds a wide programme down to the endpoint's real channel
  count per §7.8 rather than handing it to a shared-mode mixer to average down however it sees
  fit.
- **A sink that accepts neither a bitstream fallback nor PCM** gets the plain refusal `play` has
  always given.

`follow=off` disables all of the above and restores that plain refusal unconditionally — the
escape hatch for a script that wants a hard failure rather than an automatic re-encode. The
default endpoint (no `device_index` given) is unaffected either way: its capabilities were
never probed before this either, and it is taken at its word exactly as before.

AC-4 takes none of these paths. No receiver found takes it over IEC 61937, so `play` decodes an
AC-4 stream to PCM on an ordinary output whatever the sink accepts, and with `follow=off`, which
asks for passthrough alone, it refuses the stream (exit `4`).

```bash
forge play programme.ec3 2 follow=off   # refuse instead of adapting
```

`live container=fmp4`: the output path names a **folder**, written as the session runs rather than
at the end — `init.mp4` first, then a `segment*.m4s` for each fragment as it closes, with
`audio.m3u8`/`master.m3u8`/`manifest.mpd` rewritten each time. While the session is running those
manifests are live-shaped (no `#EXT-X-ENDLIST`, a `type="dynamic"` MPD with an
`availabilityStartTime`), so the folder is a servable origin mid-session; a clean stop flushes the
trailing partial fragment and closes both to their VOD/static forms. `fmp4-window=<n>` lists only
the last *n* segments, for an origin that deletes segments behind itself. Nothing is held in
memory beyond one fragment, unlike `container=mkv`/`raw`, which still accumulate the take. See
[Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#container) for the full
grammar.

`live capture2=<index>`: the `capture_device` positional stays the session's clock master, paced
exactly as it always has been; `capture2=` adds a second, independently-clocked device (see
[Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#capture2) for the full grammar) whose
stream is resampled to track the master, with the measured drift printed at session end.

### Passthrough capture

A capture endpoint fed IEC 61937 hands the bursts over as ordinary PCM. Nothing in any capture
API says "this is Dolby Digital", so a recorder that takes the samples at face value encodes
noise. `record` and `live` both look for the burst framing — a `Pa`/`Pb` preamble every
repetition period with a `0x0B77` syncframe behind it — over roughly the first quarter-second of
each session, and act on what they find:

- **`record`** switches to writing the elementary stream. Nothing is re-encoded, the `bitrate`
  argument stops applying, and the output is bit-identical to what the source sent. The carrier
  already gone past is kept, so the recording starts at the first burst rather than a
  quarter-second into it. A device running at a rate AC-3 cannot encode at — 192 kHz is exactly
  the E-AC-3 carrier's 4× — is no longer refused outright: that rate is now checked only once
  the bitstream question has been answered no.
- **`live`** stops with an error naming `record` and `unspdif`. A live session mixes, resamples
  a second device into lockstep, meters, monitors and can pan objects, none of which mean
  anything applied to burst data; switching modes mid-session would produce a file whose first
  quarter-second is a different thing from the rest.

For a capture already saved to disk, `unspdif` does the same job offline.

None of this has been confirmed against a real HDMI or S/PDIF capture device — see
[Windows](../../platforms/windows.md#audio-backend-wasapi) for exactly what is and is not verified
against hardware. What is verified is the framing itself, both ways, against FFmpeg's `spdif`
muxer as an independent oracle.

### Self-description & scripting

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `help` | With no argument, the whole usage listing. With a command name, just that command's row and the option grammars it actually uses — not the ~130 lines of prose an argument error used to print. `help exit-codes` prints the exit-code table below. |
| `man` | A section-1 groff man page on stdout, generated from the same command table. `cmake --build` writes it to `forge.1` and `cmake --install` puts it under `share/man/man1`. |
| `completions` | A completion script for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish` or `powershell` on stdout, generated from the same table plus the option list. Installed under the conventional per-shell directories; the Homebrew formula places the bash and fish halves through Homebrew's own helpers. |

`forge <command> --help` (or `-h`) is `forge help <command>` spelled the other way round, and
works even when the rest of the command line would not have satisfied that command.

Every command also takes `quiet` (no status output at all — errors and, for a `-` output, the
payload) and `verbose` (the stderr progress line whatever the run's length). See
[Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#common-options-every-command-quiet-verbose).

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Usage — a bad or missing argument, an unknown command or option, or a configuration the encoder cannot express |
| `2` | Input — unreadable, absent, or not a valid stream |
| `3` | Output — the destination could not be created, written or finalized |
| `4` | Unavailable here — this build or machine cannot run the command at all |
| `5` | Runtime — the run started and then failed (a capture dropout, an output device that went away, a measurement with nothing to measure) |
| `6` | A QC gate failed |
| `7` | Internal — an exception escaped a command |

`forge help exit-codes` prints the same table with a sentence on each; see
[Options & grammars](metadata-options.md#exit-codes) for the full descriptions and a worked
`qc` example.
