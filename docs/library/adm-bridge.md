# ADM ↔ Atmos bridging: `iclforge::admbridge`

`iclforge/adm/bridge.hpp`, `iclforge/adm/coordinates.hpp`, library `iclforge::admbridge`. Two
directions live here:

- **Read**: maps the ADM object graph [`iclforge::adm`](adm.md) parses from a BW64/ADM master onto
  [`iclforge::ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder`](spatial-and-atmos.md)'s input shape — one `iclforge::oba::ObjectPath` plus
  one mono PCM span per bed speaker feed or dynamic object, ready to drive `encode_frame()` in a
  loop. Driven end to end by `forge atmos-adm` and
  [`examples/encode_adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/encode_adm.cpp).
  `build_iab()` does the same for a parsed IAB sequence ([below](#bridging-iab)), driven by
  `forge atmos-iab`. With `codec=ac4` those two commands hand the same result to the AC-4 object
  encoder instead ([AC-4](ac4.md#encoding-objects)).
- **Write** ("JOC → ADM BWF writer"): the mirror image — maps a decoded programme's own bed/object
  PCM and object automation onto an `iclforge::adm::AdmDocument`, ready for `iclforge::adm::write_bw64()`. The
  programme is an `iclforge::ac3::Eac3Decoder`'s (its OAMD automation) or an `iclforge::ac4::Decoder`'s (each object's
  Annex F properties and updates). Driven end to end by `forge decode ... adm_out`.

Both directions are the same "one place `iclforge::adm` and `iclforge::ac3`/`iclforge::oba` are allowed to meet"
seam this module has always been, see [Commands](../forge/cli/commands.md) for both commands.

**Opt-in, gated by the same flag as `iclforge::adm`.** `iclforge::admbridge` depends on both
`iclforge::adm` and `iclforge::ac3`, so it is meaningless without `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON` and is
built as part of the same `add_subdirectory` block — no separate `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADMBRIDGE` option
exists. See [ADM / BW64 reading](adm.md) for the exact CMake invocation.

```cpp
const auto document = iclforge::adm::parse_bw64(path);
if (!document) { /* ... */ }

const auto bridged = iclforge::adm::build(*document);
if (!bridged) {
    fmt::printf("build failed: %.*s\n",
                static_cast<int>(iclforge::adm::describe(bridged.error()).size()),
                iclforge::adm::describe(bridged.error()).data());
    return 1;
}

iclforge::ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder encoder{{.bitrate_kbps = 448}, static_cast<int>(bridged->channel_count())};
// Per frame: slice bridged->pcm[i] to the frame's sample range, evaluate
// iclforge::oba::evaluate_placements(bridged->paths, t), call encoder.encode_frame(...).
```

## Why a new, standalone module

Two hard constraints rule out folding this into either side it bridges:

- `iclforge::adm` is documentedly codec-blind — its own header comments and this project's design
  keep it with zero dependency on `iclforge::ac3`/`iclforge::oba`, and that does not change here.
- `src/ac3` (`iclforge::ac3`, `iclforge::ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder`) is always built, unconditionally, by every
  configuration of this project. It cannot gain a dependency on the opt-in, Boost-requiring
  `iclforge::adm` without breaking every default build.

`iclforge::admbridge` is therefore its own module (`src/adm/`), PUBLIC-linking both — the same
shape `iclforge::signing` uses for its own `iclforge::ac3` dependency. Like `iclforge::adm` itself
(see [ADM / BW64 reading](adm.md)), it IS part of the installed `find_package(iclforge)` package,
but shared-only: `iclforge::adm_shared`/the bare `iclforge::admbridge` alias, no `_static` variant.
`build_iab()` (`iclforge/adm/iab_bridge.hpp`) maps a whole parsed `iclforge::iab::IABitstreamFrame`
sequence — from either of `iclforge::iab`'s two readers (`src/iab`: a bare elementary `.iab`
file or a real MXF Track File) — onto this same `ObjectPath` layer, driven end to end by `forge
atmos-iab` (see [Commands](../forge/cli/commands.md)). `iclforge::adm::AdmDocument` and `iclforge::iab::
IABitstreamFrame` are therefore both input shapes here, sharing the coordinate-conversion and
`ObjectPath`-construction logic this module exists to keep independent of either container's own
parsing — see "Bridging IAB" below for exactly what differs between the two.

## What gets mapped

- **Bed vs. dynamic object** is decided by the `TypeDefinition` of the `audioObject`'s own resolved
  `audioPackFormat`(s) — `AudioObject` itself carries no type of its own. `kDirectSpeakers` becomes
  a bed speaker feed; `kObjects` becomes a dynamic object. `kMatrix`, `kHoa`, `kBinaural`,
  `kUserCustom`, `kUnknown`, a nested `audioPackFormat`, or an object whose several packs disagree
  with each other all fail clearly with `BridgeError::kUnsupportedType` rather than being silently
  mishandled — none of them map onto `AtmosEncoder`'s plain position+gain+lfe_send object model
  without a design of their own, which the bridge does not have.
- **`AtmosEncoder` has no separate bed-feeding method** — its constructor takes a plain object
  count and `encode_frame()` takes one flat span of objects plus one flat span of placements,
  nothing in that signature distinguishing a bed channel from a dynamic object — so a bed channel
  is represented as an object with an unmoving, pinned placement, the only way the API allows it,
  the same convention every existing caller (`forge`'s `run_atmos_encode`, the GUI's
  `encodeObjects`) already uses. A bed channel whose `speakerLabel` identifies it as the LFE
  (BS.2076-2 Table 12: `LFE`, `LFE1`, `LFE2`) is routed at gain 0 / `lfe_send` 1 instead of panned
  — objects never reach the LFE by panning.
- **Position/gain automation** — `build_channel_path()` walks a channel's `audioBlockFormat`
  sequence into one `iclforge::oba::ObjectPath`, implementing BS.2076-2 §10.3's `jumpPosition`/
  `interpolationLength` state machine: `jumpPosition = 0` interpolates continuously across a
  block's *entire* duration; `jumpPosition = 1` jumps (or ramps over `interpolationLength`, when
  given) at the block's *start* and then holds for the rest of it; the first block in a sequence
  always holds across its own span regardless of its own `jumpPosition`. This was checked directly
  against the standard's own text and worked Figs. 7–10 — an earlier reading of just this
  behaviour's *name* ("hold vs. glide") had the two cases backwards relative to what §10.3 actually
  says, corrected once the real clause text was read rather than assumed.
- **Coordinate conversion** (`coordinates.hpp`) — BS.2076-2 §8's polar (azimuth/elevation/distance,
  positive azimuth to the left, positive elevation up) and Cartesian (X right-positive, Y
  front-positive, Z top-positive, `[-1, 1]` unit cube) conventions, both converted to
  `iclforge::oba::Position`'s room-anchored `[0, 1]`/`[0, 1]`/`[-1, 1]` one. Checked against the
  standard's own axis-direction text at the cardinal points, and empirically against this
  project's own existing ring-position constants (`tests/ac3/oba/test_atmos_motion.cpp`'s `kL`/`kR`/`kSR`)
  — the BS.2076-2 `M+030`/`M-030`/`M-110` speaker-label azimuths reproduce those exact values
  through this conversion.
- **Absolute timeline time** for a channel's automation is `object.start_s + block.rtime_s` — two
  levels, not three. BS.2076-2 Table 24 defines `audioObject`'s own `start` as relative to the
  *programme's* start directly, and §5.6.7 confirms this holds through nesting (a nested object's
  own `start` is never added to its parent's). `audioProgramme`'s own optional `start`/`end`
  (Table 37) is a separate video-alignment concept, not a third term in this sum — and
  `iclforge::adm::AudioProgramme` does not even carry a `start_s` field to add.
- **Channel resolution** walks `audioProgramme` → `audioContent` → `audioObject` (recursing through
  nested `audioObjects`, with a cycle guard per §5.6.7's own prohibition on reference loops) →
  `audioPackFormat` → `audioChannelFormat`, then resolves each channel's `audioTrackUIDRef`
  through `<chna>` to its physical PCM channel in `AdmDocument::audio`.

## Object extent and channel lock

`width`/`height`/`depth` map straight through to `iclforge::oba::ObjectSize` on every keyframe this
bridge produces. BS.2076-2 Table 15/16/17's extents and TS 103 420 §5.6.1.2's
`object_width`/`object_depth`/`object_height` are the same normalized `[0, 1]` quantity on the
same three axes, so this is a rename rather than a conversion, and §10.3's interpolation of them
between blocks is exactly what `KeyframePath` already does with position and gain.

`channelLock` maps to `ObjectPlacement::snap` — BS.2076-2 §10.2 and TS 103 420 §5.6.1.5.1
("Channel lock") describe the same instruction to a renderer: place the object at its nearest
speaker instead of panning between speakers. `maxDistance` has no image: `b_object_snap` is one
bit with no distance to condition it on, so a conditioned `channelLock` becomes an unconditioned
snap, which is the closest thing the syntax can say.

Both reach the bitstream and stop there. `AtmosEncoder` still folds every object into its 5.1 bed
as a point source, for the reason
[Spatial & Atmos objects](spatial-and-atmos.md#extent-and-rendering-constraints) gives: spreading
an object in the downmix would have the receiving renderer spread it a second time.

## What does not get mapped

- **`diffuse`** (§10.1) is parsed by `iclforge::adm` and dropped. It is a direct-versus-diffuse balance,
  not an extent; OAMD has no field for it, and folding it into `object_size` would misreport a
  decorrelation instruction as a physical size.
- **`objectDivergence`'s range** (§10.5): `azimuthRange` and `positionRange` say where the two
  objects go; OAMD has no field for them (§5.2.7 spreads the energy along X by its own rule). The
  divergence **value** is carried, see below.
- **`headLocked`** has no OAMD field.
- **A conditioned `channelLock`**: `maxDistance` is dropped and the lock applies unconditionally,
  since `b_object_snap` is one bit.
- **A `zoneExclusion` that is not a Table B.18 preset** (see below).
- **Matrix, HOA, Binaural and User Custom packs** are refused with `BridgeError::kUnsupportedType`, by
  design rather than as a gap: `AtmosEncoder` takes mono objects with a position, and a Matrix pack
  is a coefficient mix, HOA has no position, and Binaural is already rendered. libadm also has no
  model for a Matrix block's coefficients, so they are not read.

`build()` does not drop these silently. `BridgeResult::unmapped[i]` lists, for channel `i`, each feature
above that its blocks use, and `forge atmos-adm` prints one `warning:` line per such channel.

### Divergence and screen reference

Both reach the bitstream through `ObjectPlacement` and the OAMD writer, which now writes
`b_object_use_screen_ref` with its `screen_factor_bits` and `depth_factor_idx` (§5.5.11) and the
`extended_object_element` with its `obj_div_block` (§5.5.13, §5.5.14). The encoder's own bed render does
not act on either, as for size and zones.

- **`objectDivergence`'s value** (0 to 1) becomes `ObjectPlacement::divergence`, and the writer sends the
  nearest value of Table 42: a 2-bit index (`object_div_mode` 0) when the nearest is one of Table 41's four
  values, `object_div_mode` 1 when it repeats the previous block's, and the 6-bit code
  (`object_div_mode` 2) otherwise. A value that rounds to no divergence sends `b_object_divergence` 0.
  TS 103 420 Annex B has no row for it, so the correspondence is a reading: ADM's value and OAMD's
  `object_divergence` are both the share of the energy moved into two spread objects (§5.2.7).
  `src/adm/ERRATA.md` records it.
- **`screenRef`** becomes `screen_reference` with `screen_factor` 1 and `depth_factor` 1, since ADM's flag is
  all or nothing. The reference screen of Annex B.2.1.3 (`audioProgrammeReferenceScreen`, sized by a
  `ref_screen_ratio` the OAMD syntax does not carry) is not read or written; the renderer's screen applies.
- The write direction maps back: a divergence above zero becomes `objectDivergence`, and a screen reference
  with `screen_factor` of one half or more becomes `screenRef`. A smaller factor reads as room-anchored,
  because ADM cannot say how far.

### Zone constraints

`zoneExclusion` maps both ways through TS 103 420 Annex B.2.6 (Tables B.18 and B.19), since OAMD's
`zone_constraints_idx` and `b_enable_elevation` are exactly the presets that table lists:

| ADM `zone` elements (excluded) | `ZoneConstraint` |
|---|---|
| `ZM1` | `kBackExcluded` |
| `ZM2_Left`, `ZM2_Right` | `kSideExcluded` |
| `ZM3_ScreenLeft`, `ZM3_SideLeft`, `ZM3_ScreenRight`, `ZM3_SideRight` | `kCentreAndBackOnly` |
| `ZM4` | `kScreenOnly` |
| `ZM5` | `kSurroundOnly` |
| `ZU` and `ZB` together | `enable_elevation = false` |

A zone is recognised by its label, or by its six Cartesian bounds matching Table B.19 within
`kZoneBoundTolerance` (0.05). Anything else — an arbitrary cuboid, only one of `ZU` and `ZB`, two
horizontal presets at once — keeps whatever part did map, and is reported in `unmapped`.
`adm_zone_exclusion_to_constraint()` and `constraint_to_adm_zone_exclusion()` in `coordinates.hpp` are
the two directions. `write()` emits the zone of every OAMD update as a `zoneExclusion`, with both
label and bounds, so a reader using either recognises it. Table B.19 prints `ZM3_SideRight`'s `minX` as
`0.5611`; the mirrored `ZM3_SideLeft` has `-0.51611` and every other pair is symmetric, so `0.51611` is
written (see `src/adm/ERRATA.md`).

Zone and elevation are discrete decisions, so a path holds the earlier block's value until the next
block's keyframe, as it does for `snap`.

`ObjectPlacement::zone` and `ObjectPlacement::enable_elevation` exist and are transmitted — a
caller constructing paths directly can set them; it is only the ADM-derived route that leaves them
at their defaults.

## Bridging IAB

`build_iab(std::span<const iclforge::iab::IABitstreamFrame> frames)` maps a whole parsed Immersive Audio
Bitstream sequence — `iclforge::iab::parse_iabitstream()` or `iclforge::iab::parse_mxf_iab()`'s own return value,
unmodified — onto the identical destination shape `build()` produces for ADM, in a new header,
`iclforge/adm/iab_bridge.hpp`.

IAB has no whole-file object graph the way ADM's `audioProgramme → audioContent → audioObject` tree
does — it is a flat sequence of self-contained `IaFrame`s, each carrying its own Bed/Object metadata
scoped to that frame alone (§9.2/§9.4). `build_iab()` therefore does its own two-pass walk: an
identity pass unions every unconditionally-Activated top-level Bed channel/Object across every
frame, keyed by §10.3.1's own MetaID ("the ID that allows the system to track metadata information
between audio frames" — for a Bed channel, combined with its own ChannelID per §10.3.5's note on
ST 2098-1's Channel Identifier function) — fixing `AtmosEncoder`'s channel count and order once, the
same role `collect_leaf_objects()` plays for `build()`'s own ADM walk. A timeline pass then builds
one `ObjectPath` per identity spanning the whole sequence: a frame where that identity is absent, or
only conditionally Activated (an alternate-target-environment mix per §10.3.2/§10.5.1's own
Activation/UseCase fields — the same "pick the one primary set" choice `build()` already makes among
several `audioProgramme`s), contributes no new keyframe — silence-filled PCM, the timeline simply
holds/interpolates through the gap — rather than shrinking the channel count.

Only top-level `IaFrame::beds`/`objects` are walked — nested `BedDefinition`/`BedRemap`/
`ObjectDefinition`/`ObjectZoneDefinition19` children (§9 Table 4) are deliberately not recursed
into: Annex C.1's own nesting allowance exists for alternate/derived submixes, not the primary
content this bridge selects one of.

**Bed channels have no per-block position data at all** (unlike ADM's `audioBlockFormat` sequence)
— a Bed channel's own ChannelID (§10.3.5 Table 19) is a closed, physical-position vocabulary
resolved once via `iclforge::oba::bed_label_position()`, the same pinned-placement convention bed
channels already get from ADM's `speakerLabel`; only `ChannelGain` (§10.3.8) can legitimately vary
frame to frame, so a Bed channel's timeline is one keyframe per frame it is present in. An LFE Bed
channel (ChannelID `0xD`, or `0x86`/`0x87`'s BS.2051-2 `LFE1`/`LFE2` aliases) routes at gain 0 /
`lfe_send` 1, the same convention `build_channel_path()` documents for ADM.

**Table 19's cinema channel vocabulary is richer than `iclforge::oba::BedLabel`'s own consumer-layout
one in exactly one place**: it names three distinct surround zones per side (Side Surround,
Surround, Rear Surround) where `BedLabel` has only two slots (`kLs`/`kRs`, `kLb`/`kRb`).
"Surround" (`0x6`/`0xA`) maps to `kLs`/`kRs` (the canonical 5.1 pair) and "Rear Surround"
(`0x7`/`0x8`) to `kLb`/`kRb` (7.1's additional back pair, the closest conceptual match); "Side
Surround" (`0x5`/`0x9`) has no equivalent and is refused — `BridgeError::kUnsupportedIabChannel`,
not silently collapsed onto an existing slot. Several other Table 19 codes (Left/Right Center,
Center Height, the `*Height` variants of Side/Rear Surround, Left/Right Top Surround, Top
Surround, and the whole `0x18`-`0x7F` D-Cinema-reserved range) are refused the same way,
deliberately, rather than guessed at without the external documents Table 19 itself defers to
(SMPTE ST 428-12/ST 2098-5) for their exact geometry.

**Position conversion needs no formula at all.** `iab_position_to_room()` (`coordinates.hpp`) is a
direct passthrough: §11.1's `x`/`y` (0 left/front wall to 1 right/back wall) already match
`iclforge::oba::Position`'s own convention exactly, and its `z` — "0 corresponds to a horizontal plane
at... the height of the main screen Loudspeakers... 1 corresponds to the ceiling" — anchors its
zero at the same screen/ear-height reference `oba::Position`'s own `z = 0` does, just never
expressing anything below it (IAB's `[0, 1]` is the upper half of `oba::Position::z`'s own
`[-1 floor, +1 ceiling]` range). This is this bridge's own judgement call — no clause states the
two specs share a reference height — the same status the ADM conversion's own one undocumented gap
has above.

**Spread** (§10.5.15-17) becomes `ObjectSize`: `iab_spread_to_size()` takes the spread on x, y and z as
width, depth and height. ST 2098-2 defines the spread as the extent of the object, in fractions of
the unit cube, and TS 103 420 §5.6.1.2 codes `object_width`, `object_depth` and `object_height` as
normalized `[0, 1]` extents on the same axes. No clause states that the two scales are the same;
this is the same rename the ADM bridge makes. A point source (`OBJECT_SPREAD_NONE`) is size zero.

**Zone control** becomes `ZoneConstraint` and `b_enable_elevation`. `iab_zones_to_constraint()` takes
the nine gains of §10.5.11-14 Table 24 and `iab_zones19_to_constraint()` the nineteen of an
`ObjectZoneDefinition19` child (§10.6 Table 28), which replaces the nine when present. A gain of 0.5
or more counts as the zone being included, because TS 103 420 Table 20 includes or excludes a zone
and has no gain. The horizontal zones map to a preset only when their pattern is exactly that
preset's:

| Preset | Included horizontal zones |
|---|---|
| none | all |
| back excluded | all but the two rear zones |
| side excluded | all but the two wall zones |
| centre and back | screen centre and the two rear zones |
| screen only | the three screen zones |
| surround only | the two wall zones and the two rear zones |

Any other pattern leaves the object unconstrained (`IabZoneMapping::exact` is false) rather than
picking a preset that would exclude the wrong zones. The overhead zones set `b_enable_elevation`:
on when either is included, or, for the 19-zone form, when any height-layer or ceiling zone is. A
`zone19` update in a sub block with no pan information has no keyframe to ride on and takes effect
at the next sub block that has one.

Both reach the bitstream and stop there, as ADM's width and zone do: `AtmosEncoder` folds each
object into the bed as a point.

`IabBridgeResult` is a **new** struct, not a reuse of `BridgeResult`: PCM is concatenated across
many independently-parsed frames, so `IabBridgeResult::pcm` is **owned**
(`std::vector<std::vector<float>>`), not borrowed the way `BridgeResult::pcm` is from a single
caller-owned `AdmDocument` — there is no equivalent single upstream object here to borrow spans
from once `build_iab()` returns.

## Write direction

`write()` takes a `WriteInput` — a sample rate plus one `WriteChannel` per channel to place in the
master, in any order — and returns an `iclforge::adm::AdmDocument` ready for `iclforge::adm::write_bw64()`. A
channel is either a bed channel (`bed_label` set — written as a static `DirectSpeakers` channel
pinned at `iclforge::oba::bed_label_position()`, `updates` unused) or a dynamic object (`bed_label`
empty — written as an `Objects` channel whose `audioBlockFormat` sequence comes from `updates`).
Each `audioTrackUID` carries the input's `sampleRate` and a `bitDepth` of `iclforge::adm::kWriteBitDepth`,
the width `write_bw64()` stores the PCM at, and `audio.bits_per_sample` holds the same width, so
the returned document already describes the master it becomes.

Scoped to exactly what this project's own decoders produce: a dynamic-object-only-or-single-
bed-instance programme (`Eac3Decoder` never emits ISF objects, several bed instances, or
non-standard Table 13 assignments — see `oamd.hpp`'s own `Program` comment; an AC-4 presentation's
objects come from `iclforge::ac4::DecodedFrame::objects`, which lists bed and dynamic objects and renders an
intermediate spatial format into channels instead), no nested `audioObject`s, cartesian positions
only. `forge decode`'s `adm_out` wiring (`decode.cpp`) additionally only attempts this for an
E-AC-3 `dynamic_only` programme — a channel-based-immersive bed programme (third-party content) is
warned about and skipped, not written incorrectly.

**`WriteObjectUpdate` is the write-direction input for one OAMD update**, timestamped in absolute
samples from the start of the whole decode (not the access unit it arrived in) — a caller
assembles the list by walking every decoded access unit's own
`DecodedAccessUnit::object_metadata->blocks` in file order and adding each block's own
`sample_offset` to a running total of samples already emitted. `build_block_formats()` (internal
to `bridge.cpp`) turns this into one `audioBlockFormat` per update: TS 103 420's own per-block
model — a value takes effect at `sample_offset`, reached over `ramp_duration` samples, then held —
is already, block for block, BS.2076-2 §10.3's `jumpPosition = 1` + `interpolationLength` case, so
this direction needs none of `build_channel_path()`'s own read-direction case analysis; the first
update in a channel's sequence becomes a plain hold (§10.3's "the first block covers its entire
length regardless of `jumpPosition`" rule), every later one an explicit jump/ramp.

`room_to_adm_cartesian()` (`coordinates.hpp`) is the algebraic inverse of `adm_cartesian_to_room()`
above (`x_adm = 2·x_room - 1`, `y_adm = 1 - 2·y_room`, `z_adm = z_room`) — this writer only ever
emits cartesian ADM, matching the Dolby Atmos Master ADM Profile's own shape, so there is no
matching polar inverse.

std::expected<iclforge::adm::AdmDocument, BridgeError> write(const WriteInput& input);
```

`BridgeResult` is deliberately struct-of-arrays, not one struct per channel — `paths` is directly
usable as the `std::span<const iclforge::oba::ObjectPath>` `iclforge::oba::evaluate_placements` wants, with
no projection step. `channel_count() <= 15`: `AtmosEncoder`'s own constructor `objects` parameter
is dynamic objects only, with the bed's own LFE bookkeeping as an implicit, always-present 16th
(TS 103 420 §8.3.2.2 caps the total at 16) — the same cap `forge`'s `run_atmos_encode`/
`run_atmos_path` already enforce, reused here rather than re-derived. `build()` and `build_iab()`
refuse more channels than that whatever consumes the result, so `atmos-adm` and `atmos-iab` with
`codec=ac4` are held to 15 as well, though the AC-4 object encoder takes 64. `sample_rate` is the raw
`iclforge::adm::PcmAudio::sample_rate`, unconverted — mapping it to `iclforge::ac3::SampleRate` (and rejecting an
unsupported rate) is left to the caller, the same way every existing WAV-reading entry point
already does that itself.

`bitrate_kbps`/`dialnorm` and every other `AtmosConfig` field are encoding choices ADM data does
not carry at all — `build()` deliberately does not invent defaults for them; constructing
`AtmosConfig` is the caller's job.

## Tests

`tests/adm/test_adm_bridge.cpp` covers coordinate conversion (against BS.2076-2 §8's cardinal points
and this project's own existing ring constants), `build_channel_path`'s full §10.3 state machine
(single block, continuous-glide blocks, instant-jump blocks, ramp-then-hold blocks, the
first-block-always-holds override, the LFE override), `build()`'s graph-walking error paths
(unresolved references, a reference cycle, an unsupported pack type, a channel/track-count
mismatch, the 15-channel cap, default programme selection), and one flagship test that builds a
real byte-level BW64 fixture (two DirectSpeakers bed channels plus one Objects channel that holds
at one ring position and then jumps to another), parses it with the real `iclforge::adm::parse_bw64()`,
bridges it, and drives a real `iclforge::ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder`/`iclforge::ac3::Eac3Decoder` round trip — confirming
the decoded bitstream's channel energy actually lands where the authored ADM positions and hold/
jump timing say it should, the same standard `tests/ac3/oba/test_atmos_motion.cpp`'s own flagship test
holds itself to.

`tests/cli/test_cli_atmos_adm.cpp` covers the same fixture shape one level up: it runs the
real, built `forge` binary's `atmos-adm` command as a subprocess against a real ADM BWF file on
disk, then decodes what that binary actually wrote and checks the same channel-energy assertions —
proving the CLI's own argument parsing and its `parse_bw64` → `build` → `AtmosEncoder` wiring, not
just the library API in isolation — plus two error-path cases (`BridgeError::kNoProgramme`, a
malformed/non-RIFF file) confirming `describe()` reaches the terminal rather than an opaque crash
or exit code.

`tests/adm/test_iab_bridge.cpp` covers `iab_position_to_room`'s cardinal points, the Table 19
→ `BedLabel` mapping (both the codes that resolve and the ones `build_iab()` refuses), MetaID
cross-frame identity (the same MetaID+ChannelID across several frames is one channel, not several;
an absent frame silence-fills rather than shrinking the channel count), sub-block keyframe timing
(a dedicated fixture proving each active sub block's keyframe lands at its own *end* time, not its
start), and one flagship test with the identical rigor `test_adm_bridge.cpp`'s own holds itself to
— a real byte-level IAB fixture (one Bed Center channel, one Object holding hard right then
jumping hard left), parsed with the real `iclforge::iab::parse_iabitstream()`, bridged, and driven through
a real `AtmosEncoder`/`Eac3Decoder` round trip confirming decoded channel energy lands where
authored. `tests/cli/test_cli_atmos_iab.cpp` covers the same fixture shape one level up, the same
way `test_cli_atmos_adm.cpp` does for `atmos-adm`.
