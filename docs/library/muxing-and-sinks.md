# Muxing & sinks

## Muxing: `iclforge::containers::matroska::mux`

`iclforge/containers/matroska/matroska.hpp`, `iclforge::containers::matroska`, a part of `iclforge::containers`. It links nothing from `iclforge::ac3` and
takes frames as opaque bytes. Pairing it with `iclforge::ac3::io::scan` is what keeps the track header
accurate.

```cpp
// One Matroska frame per access unit. For E-AC-3 an access unit is the
// independent substream plus its dependents, which is exactly what scan
// groups — a player must receive them together.
std::vector<std::vector<std::byte>> frames;
for (const auto unit : scanned->access_units) {
    frames.emplace_back(unit.begin(), unit.end());
}

const iclforge::containers::matroska::AudioTrack track{
    .codec_id = std::string{scanned->kind == iclforge::ac3::io::StreamKind::kAc3
                                ? iclforge::containers::matroska::kCodecAc3
                                : iclforge::containers::matroska::kCodecEac3},
    .sample_rate = iclforge::ac3::sample_rate_hz(scanned->sample_rate),
    .channels = scanned->channels,
    .samples_per_frame = iclforge::ac3::kSamplesPerFrame,
};

const auto file = iclforge::containers::matroska::mux(track, frames);
```

Full program: [`examples/mux_mkv.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/mux_mkv.cpp).

`mux` returns the whole file as bytes and does no file I/O, which keeps it testable without a
disk. It writes one audio track, one SimpleBlock per frame, clusters closed on a time budget,
and Info with TimestampScale and Duration. No SeekHead, no Cues, no chapters, no tags — those
matter for seeking in large files, not for playing back what this project produces. Matroska
registers no `CodecID` for AC-4, so this module has no constant for one and `forge mkv` refuses an
AC-4 stream.

### Incremental muxing: `iclforge::containers::matroska::Writer`

Same header. The incremental counterpart to `mux`, for a session whose length is not known up
front — a live capture, where `mux` cannot help: it needs every frame before it can compute
anything. `Writer::create(track, options)` validates the track the same way `mux` does.
`header()` holds the EBML header through Tracks, written exactly once; each `push(frame)`
buffers into the current cluster and returns the bytes of whichever cluster just closed (empty
on most calls); `finalize()` flushes the last partial cluster. Segment is written with EBML's
reserved unknown-size pattern and Duration is omitted — the standard streamed-Matroska shape,
which real players already handle. No more than one cluster's worth of frames is ever held, so
a caller streaming the returned bytes to disk keeps memory bounded for a session of any length.
This is what the GUI's live session records through.

### Demuxing: `iclforge::containers::matroska::demux`, `iclforge::containers::matroska::Reader`

`iclforge/containers/matroska/reader.hpp`, same library. The read side of the two above, and codec-blind in exactly
the same way: it walks EBML, finds a track, and hands each frame back as opaque bytes. The one
place it names a codec is auto-selection, which takes the first audio `TrackEntry` whose
`CodecID` is `A_EAC3` or `A_AC3`; `ReadOptions::track_number` names any other track explicitly
and accepts whatever `CodecID` it carries.

Two shapes, mirroring the write side. `demux` is the batch one, and it is zero-copy — the frames
it returns are spans into the buffer you passed it, the way `iclforge::ac3::io::scan` already hands back
access units:

```cpp
const auto out = iclforge::containers::matroska::demux(file_bytes);
if (!out) {
    std::println(stderr, "{}", iclforge::containers::matroska::describe(out.error()));
    return 1;
}
// out->frames are views into file_bytes, which must outlive them.
const auto scanned = iclforge::ac3::io::scan(/* the elementary stream you write them to */);
```

`Reader` is the incremental one — `iclforge::containers::matroska::Writer`'s mirror image, for a file too big to hold.
Frames arrive through a callback rather than a return value, so nothing accumulates: peak memory
is one chunk plus one frame, never the file.

```cpp
iclforge::containers::matroska::Reader reader{};
const auto on_frame = [&](std::span<const std::byte> frame) { sink.push(frame); };
for (auto chunk = read_next_chunk(); !chunk.empty(); chunk = read_next_chunk()) {
    if (!reader.push(chunk, on_frame)) { /* ... */ }
}
if (!reader.finish(on_frame)) { /* ... */ }
```

The span handed to the callback is valid for that call only — it points into the reader's own
buffer, which the next `push` reuses. Copy it there if you need to keep it. This is what
`forge demux` runs on, which is why a multi-gigabyte rip never lands in memory.

What it reads beyond what this project writes, because a file from a disc rip or another muxer
has it: all three lacing forms (Xiph, EBML, fixed-size), `BlockGroup`-wrapped `Block`s as well
as `SimpleBlock`, several tracks, 32-bit as well as 64-bit `SamplingFrequency`, and clusters
left at EBML's unknown size rather than only the Segment. A file truncated mid-cluster returns
every whole frame before the cut rather than an error — that is how a live recording ends.

**Untrusted input.** Every length in an EBML file is self-declared, and a container arrives from
a rip, a capture or a download rather than from this project's own writer. `ReadOptions` bounds
the element size the reader will hold (16 MiB by default; anything larger that it does not need
is skipped without ever being buffered), the frames one laced block may carry, the number of
`TrackEntry` elements, and how deep masters may nest — the walker is iterative, so nothing an
input declares can exhaust the call stack. `libs/containers/fuzz/fuzz_matroska_demux.cpp` drives both entry
points with arbitrary bytes under ASan/UBSan.

## Muxing: `iclforge::containers::mp4::mux`

`iclforge/containers/mp4/mp4.hpp`, `iclforge::containers::mp4`, a part of `iclforge::containers`. Same shape as `iclforge::containers::matroska`: it links nothing from
`iclforge::ac3` and takes frames as opaque bytes. The one place MP4 needs codec-specific bytes that
Matroska's plain CodecID string does not is the sample entry's `dac3`/`dec3` configuration box
(ETSI TS 102 366 Annex F) — so `iclforge::containers::mp4::AudioTrack::codec_config` carries that box's payload as
opaque bytes too, built by `iclforge::ac3::io::build_codec_config_box` (`iclforge/ac3/io/dec3.hpp`) straight off
whatever `iclforge::ac3::io::scan` read out of the bitstream, fscod/bsid/bsmod/acmod/lfeon and, when the
stream carries Dolby Atmos objects, the `flag_ec3_extension_type_a`/`complexity_index_type_a`
extension (TS 103 420 §8.3.1/§8.3.2.2) alike.

The same codec-blind contract carries **AC-4**: `codec_id = iclforge::containers::mp4::kCodecAc4`
selects TS 103 190-2 Annex E.4's `ac-4` sample entry with a `dac4` configuration box, whose
payload comes from `iclforge::ac4::build_dac4()` off the stream's own parsed TOC — the AC-4 twin of
`build_codec_config_box`, in `iclforge::ac4` where the codec knowledge lives. An ISOBMFF `ac-4`
*sample* is the `raw_ac4_frame` alone (no sync word, no CRC), `samples_per_frame` and
`AudioTrack::timescale` come from `iclforge::ac4::media_timing()` (TS 103 190-2 Table E.1: the sample rate,
or 240 000 for the 1000/1001-family rates whose frame length alternates at 48 kHz, where a frame is
8 008, 4 004 or 2 002), a stream whose frames are not all I-frames names its I-frames in
`MuxOptions::sync_samples`, which writes the Sync Sample Box Annex E.2 asks for, and because AC-4's
RFC 6381 string is not
its fourcc, `AudioTrack::rfc6381` carries `iclforge::ac4::rfc6381_codec_string()`'s dotted form
(`ac-4.02.01.00`) for the HLS/DASH manifests. MPEG-TS carriage is DVB-only — EN 300 468
Annex D.7's extension descriptor `0x7F/0x15`, with an ISO 13818-1 §2.6.8 registration
descriptor (`AC-4`) beside it for interop — and `iclforge::containers::mpegts::AudioCodec::kAc4` under the ATSC
profile is refused rather than given an invented stream_type (A/342-2 is ATSC 3.0's
ROUTE/MMT, not 13818-1).

```cpp
// One MP4 sample per access unit. For E-AC-3 an access unit is the
// independent substream plus its dependents, which is exactly what scan
// groups — a player must receive them together.
std::vector<std::vector<std::byte>> frames;
frames.reserve(scanned->access_units.size());
for (const auto unit : scanned->access_units) {
    frames.emplace_back(unit.begin(), unit.end());
}

const iclforge::containers::mp4::AudioTrack track{
    .codec_id = std::string{scanned->kind == iclforge::ac3::io::StreamKind::kAc3 ? iclforge::containers::mp4::kCodecAc3
                                                                        : iclforge::containers::mp4::kCodecEac3},
    .sample_rate = iclforge::ac3::sample_rate_hz(scanned->sample_rate),
    .channels = scanned->channels,
    .samples_per_frame = iclforge::ac3::kSamplesPerFrame,
    // The dac3/dec3 sample-entry box, built from the same scan result -
    // see iclforge/ac3/io/dec3.hpp for why this lives in iclforge::ac3::io rather than in
    // iclforge::containers::mp4 itself.
    .codec_config = iclforge::ac3::io::build_codec_config_box(*scanned),
};

const auto file = iclforge::containers::mp4::mux(track, frames);
```

Full program: [`examples/mux_mp4.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/mux_mp4.cpp).

`mux` returns the whole file as bytes and does no file I/O, the same as `iclforge::containers::matroska::mux`. It
writes `ftyp`/`moov`/`mdat` for one audio track, one sample per chunk, `stts`/`stsz`/`stco` built
straight off the frame sizes handed in. No multiple tracks: those matter for multi-track muxing,
not for playing back what this project produces.

An edit list is written only when `MuxOptions::edit` asks for one, and then it has one edit:
`start_samples` to skip at the start (an encoder's priming) and `duration_samples` to play after
them (ending before the last frame's padding). The movie and track durations become the edit's;
the media's stays the length of its samples. An edit that runs past the frames, or plays
nothing, is `kInvalidOptions`.

Getting the `dec3`/`dac3` box right from the spec is the point: FFmpeg's MKV→MP4 remux path used
to silently drop or mis-signal the Atmos extension
([jellyfin-ffmpeg#584](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-ffmpeg/issues/584), upstream
[FFmpeg trac #9996](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/9996), since fixed) — building it from
`iclforge::ac3::io::scan`'s own read of the bitstream, rather than by copying another tool's output, is
what this module avoided that bug by construction rather than by patching it after the fact, and
still does for any FFmpeg build older than the fix.

### Demuxing: `iclforge::containers::mp4::demux`, `iclforge::containers::mp4::Reader`

`iclforge/containers/mp4/reader.hpp`, same library. The read side of both writers above, and the same shape the
Matroska reader has: `demux` is batch and zero-copy (samples are spans into your buffer),
`Reader` is incremental (samples arrive through a callback, peak memory is one chunk plus one
sample).

It reads both layouts, from either writer and from a real muxer: a plain `moov`/`mdat` file,
walking `stsc`/`stsz`(or `stz2`)/`stco`(or `co64`) to turn the sample table into byte ranges, and
a fragmented one, taking `mvex`/`trex`'s defaults plus every `moof`/`traf`/`tfhd`/`trun` that
follows. A 64-bit `largesize` box header and an `mdat` declared to run to end-of-file both read
normally, though neither writer here emits them.

**`moov` before `mdat`.** `demux` can reach any offset, so it reads a file whose sample table sits
either side of the media data. `Reader` cannot — locating a sample means seeking backwards, and a
stream has nowhere to go back to — so a `moov`-last file reports `kMoovAfterMdat` rather than
silently returning nothing. That is the layout a muxer leaves behind when it never rewrote the
file for "faststart"; `mux()` and `fragment()` both write `moov` first, as does any web-optimised
file.

**The `dec3`/`dac3` box comes back parsed.** `ReadTrack::codec_config` is a `CodecConfig`, the read
twin of [`iclforge::ac3::io::build_codec_config_box`](#muxing-iclforgecontainersmp4mux): `fscod`, `bsid`, `bsmod`, `acmod`,
`lfeon`, `bit_rate_code` or `data_rate_kbps`, `num_ind_sub`/`num_dep_sub`/`chan_loc`, and —
crucially — TS 103 420's `flag_ec3_extension_type_a`/`complexity_index_type_a` as an
`optional<int>`. That last field is the Atmos/JOC marker an FFmpeg remux is known to drop, and
reading it back is what makes the repair case possible: demux a file, keep the complexity index,
re-mux it with the signalling intact. The values are reported as raw syntax numbers rather than
`iclforge::` enums, because this module has no dependency on the codec library and no business
deciding what `fscod` 0 means. `payload` keeps the bytes verbatim, so a caller remuxing into
another container can hand them straight back.

A `dec3` box that stops before the Atmos extension leaves `oba_complexity_index` empty rather
than reporting a confident zero — the extension is a trailing addition, and a box written before
TS 103 420 simply has nothing to say about it.

**Edit lists come back as stored.** `ReadTrack::edits` holds the track's `elst` entries in file
order (version 0 or 1), each with its `segment_duration` in the movie's timescale,
`ReadTrack::movie_timescale` from `mvhd`, and its `media_time` in the track's own timescale, where
-1 marks an empty edit. Nothing here applies them, because what a media time means depends on
the codec. `apps/common/container_input.hpp` turns the shape an audio encoder writes into a
`StreamTrim`: any empty edits, then one edit at normal speed. The trim is the samples to skip and
the samples to play, and Hearth's player plays only that part. Any other shape leaves the stream
whole, with a note saying why. `forge` and the GUI do not apply the trim. Neither `elst`
nor `mvhd` is needed to find a sample, so one too short to read, one that declares more entries
than it holds, or one longer than `ReadOptions::max_edits` is left out, and the file still reads.

**Untrusted input.** An MP4's sample table is an *index*, which is a wider attack surface than
Matroska's in-line framing: `stsc` names chunks, `stco` names absolute file offsets and `stsz`
names sizes, all self-declared and all resolved against each other before a byte of audio is
touched. `ReadOptions` bounds the box size the reader will hold, the sample and chunk counts
(`max_samples` defaults to about 35 hours of access units), and the nesting depth; the walk is
iterative. A chunk offset pointing past the end of the file drops that sample rather than
failing the file — a truncated download is ordinary, and the samples that *are* present are all
real. `libs/containers/fuzz/fuzz_mp4_demux.cpp` drives both entry points with arbitrary bytes.

## Muxing: `iclforge::containers::mpegts::mux`

`iclforge/containers/mpegts/mpegts.hpp`, `iclforge::containers::mpegts`, a part of `iclforge::containers`. Same shape as `iclforge::containers::matroska::mux` above — it links
nothing from `iclforge::ac3` beyond the AC-3, E-AC-3 or AC-4 choice it is told, and takes access
units as opaque bytes.

```cpp
// One PES-wrapped access unit per TS access unit. For E-AC-3 an access
// unit is the independent substream plus its dependents, which is
// exactly what scan groups — a player must receive them together.
std::vector<std::vector<std::byte>> frames;
frames.reserve(scanned->access_units.size());
for (const auto unit : scanned->access_units) {
    frames.emplace_back(unit.begin(), unit.end());
}

const iclforge::containers::mpegts::AudioTrack track{
    .codec = scanned->kind == iclforge::ac3::io::StreamKind::kAc3 ? iclforge::containers::mpegts::AudioCodec::kAc3
                                                         : iclforge::containers::mpegts::AudioCodec::kEac3,
    .sample_rate = iclforge::ac3::sample_rate_hz(scanned->sample_rate),
    .channels = scanned->channels,
    .samples_per_frame = iclforge::ac3::kSamplesPerFrame,
    // What the PMT descriptor says about the service. Every field is a plain
    // A/52 value iclforge::ac3::io::scan already read off the bitstream.
    .service = {.bsmod = scanned->bsmod,
                .bsmod_present = scanned->bsmod_present,
                .acmod = static_cast<int>(scanned->acmod),
                .lfe = scanned->lfe,
                .channels = scanned->channels,
                .bsid = scanned->bsid,
                .dsurmod = scanned->dsurmod,
                .bit_rate_code = scanned->bit_rate_code,
                .sample_rate_code = static_cast<int>(scanned->sample_rate),
                .mix_metadata = scanned->mix_metadata,
                .independent_substreams = scanned->independent_substreams},
};

const auto file = iclforge::containers::mpegts::mux(track, frames,
                              {.profile = iclforge::containers::mpegts::BroadcastProfile::kAtsc});
```

Full program: [`examples/mux_ts.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/mux_ts.cpp).

`mux` returns the whole 188-byte-aligned Transport Stream as bytes, no file I/O, same testability
reasoning as `iclforge::containers::matroska::mux`. It writes a single program — one PAT, one PMT (repeated
periodically so a receiver tuning in mid-stream doesn't wait for byte zero), and one PES-wrapped
elementary stream carrying PCR every access unit. No video, no other elementary streams, no PID
remapping: a general-purpose multiplexer is out of scope, this is enough for a player or
`ffprobe` to recognize one AC-3, E-AC-3 or AC-4 programme.

**Broadcast profile.** Two standards register AC-3/E-AC-3 for MPEG-TS carriage — ATSC and DVB —
with different, non-interoperable signalling, so a stream is written to satisfy one of them,
never a bit of each. `MuxOptions::profile` picks which:

| | `kDvb` (default) | `kAtsc` |
|---|---|---|
| AC-3 `stream_type` | `0x06`, PES private data | `0x81` (A/52 Annex A §A4.1) |
| E-AC-3 `stream_type` | `0x06` | `0x87` (A/52 Annex G §G3.1) |
| AC-3 descriptor | `AC3_descriptor`, tag `0x6A` (EN 300 468 Table D.6) | `AC-3_audio_stream_descriptor`, tag `0x81` (A/52 Table A4.1) |
| E-AC-3 descriptor | `enhanced_AC-3_descriptor`, tag `0x7A` (Table D.7) | `E-AC-3_audio_descriptor`, tag `0xCC` (A/52 Table G.1) |
| What identifies the stream | the descriptor tag — DVB registers no `stream_type` of its own | the `stream_type` — ATSC treats the descriptor as configuration detail |

Both descriptors describe the same service in different bit layouts, so a caller supplies the
underlying A/52 field values once, as `iclforge::containers::mpegts::ServiceInfo`, and the module maps them onto
whichever registry's tables the profile calls for — EN 300 468 Tables D.1–D.8, A/52 Tables
A4.2–A4.6 and G.2–G.6. That mapping is descriptor syntax, which is this module's job; reading
those values off the bitstream is `iclforge::ac3::io::scan`'s, which is why `ServiceInfo` is plain
integers and `iclforge::containers::mpegts` still links nothing from `iclforge::ac3`.

`iclforge::ac3::io::ScannedStream` supplies every one of them: `bsmod` (with `bsmod_present`, since
Annex E only carries it inside `infomdate`), `acmod`, `lfe`, the rendered `channels`, `bsid`,
`dsurmod`, `bit_rate_code`, `mix_metadata` for `mixinfoexists`, and `independent_substreams`
with `associated_substreams` for the `substream1`–`3` fields. Two values are *not* in any
bitstream, because they describe how services in a multiplex relate rather than what one stream
contains — `mainid` and `asvc` — and those stay unset unless the caller supplies them
(`forge ts ... mainid=3`, `asvc=0,2` — a comma-separated list of main-service numbers, or the
raw bitmask directly as `asvc=0x05`). An unset optional field is omitted rather than
zero-filled: a receiver already handles an absent one, where an invented main-service number
links the wrong services. What *is* checked is consistency with the stream's own `bsmod`:
`asvc=` on a stream Table 5.7 calls a main service, or `mainid=` on one it calls an associated
service, is a usage error (`iclforge::ac3::meta::is_associated_service` is the predicate, shared with the
`dec3`/`EC3SpecificBox` writer's own `asvc` bit) — the wire fields exist either way, but which
one describes *this* stream is not the operator's to override.

Two places where the standards' own tables cannot express something this project can read, and
the field is omitted rather than approximated: A/52 Table G.5 reserves complete-main and
emergency as *substream* service types, and Table G.6 reserves 1+1 as a substream channel mode,
so an ATSC `substream1`–`3` field for such a substream is left out with its flag clear.

### Demuxing: `iclforge::containers::mpegts::demux`, `iclforge::containers::mpegts::Reader`

`iclforge/containers/mpegts/reader.hpp`, same library. The read side of `iclforge::containers::mpegts::mux`/`Writer`, codec-blind in the
same sense: it locks to the packet grid, follows PAT to PMT to an elementary PID, reassembles
PES, and hands the payloads back as opaque bytes.

**What comes back is not the same shape as the sibling readers.** A Matroska `SimpleBlock` and an
MP4 sample each hold exactly one access unit, so `iclforge::containers::matroska::demux`/`iclforge::containers::mp4::demux` hand back access
units. A PES packet makes no such promise — it may carry one, several, or (with the unbounded
`PES_packet_length` form broadcast uses) a run ending only when the next one starts. So this
reader hands back **PES payloads**, and what they concatenate to is the elementary stream:

```cpp
const auto out = iclforge::containers::mpegts::demux(file_bytes);
if (!out) {
    fmt::println(stderr, "{}", iclforge::containers::mpegts::describe(out.error()));
    return 1;
}
std::vector<std::byte> elementary_stream;
for (const auto& payload : out->payloads) {
    elementary_stream.insert(elementary_stream.end(), payload.begin(), payload.end());
}
const auto scanned = iclforge::ac3::io::scan(elementary_stream);
```

This is exactly what `iclforge::ac3::io::scan` wants, and re-framing PES payloads into access units is its
job, not this module's — doing it here would mean this container-blind module knowing what an
AC-3 syncframe is.

**The PMT's own service descriptor comes back too**, as `ReadStream::service` (a
`std::optional<ServiceInfo>`, `std::nullopt` when the signalling carried no such descriptor to
read — `kRegistrationDescriptor` and AC-4 never do). `iclforge::containers::mpegts::parse_service_descriptor` is the
literal inverse of the four descriptor builders above, so a transport stream this module wrote
reads back byte-for-byte what `mux`'s caller supplied — `bsmod`, `full_service`, `mainid`,
`asvc`, `bsid`, `mix_metadata` and the `substream1`–`3` bytes alike. Not everything survives the
round trip, because the wire format itself cannot express it: `acmod`/`channels`/`lfe`/`dsurmod`
stay at `ServiceInfo`'s own defaults rather than reconstructed, since `channel_flags()` is a
many-to-one summary forward (Table D.5/G.3/A4.5's "more than 5.1 channels" row covers a range,
not one value) with no exact acmod to recover backward — a caller that has the elementary stream
already has those exact values from `iclforge::ac3::io::scan()`, the same source `mux`'s own caller used.

**Four signalling forms.** For AC-3 and E-AC-3, `mux` chooses between DVB and ATSC through
`MuxOptions::profile` (see above), and commits to one of them wholly. A reader has no such luxury:
a third family of files names the codec through neither, using a
`registration_descriptor`'s `'AC-3'`/`'EAC3'` `format_identifier` instead, and AC-4 is named by
DVB's extension descriptor `0x7F/0x15` beside a `stream_type` of `0x06`. All four are recognised
on read, reported as `ReadStream::signalling` (`CodecSignalling::kAtscStreamType` /
`kDvbDescriptor` / `kRegistrationDescriptor` / `kDvbExtensionDescriptor`) so a caller remuxing back
out knows which it was; `ReadStream::ac4` says the payload is AC-4, whose PES bytes come back
without framing, for `iclforge::ac4::scan` or `iclforge::ac4::SyncFrameSplitter` to split.

**Three packet grids**, detected rather than assumed: 188 bytes (ISO/IEC 13818-1's own), 192
(M2TS — a Blu-ray/AVCHD rip, each packet prefixed by a 4-byte arrival timestamp), and 204 (a
capture that kept its Reed-Solomon parity). The grid is found by where the `0x47` sync byte
repeats at a consistent stride, several packets in a row — a stray `0x47` in payload cannot fake
that — which also means a capture that starts mid-packet (the normal way a transport stream is
acquired: wherever the tuner happened to be) still locks on.

```cpp
iclforge::containers::mpegts::Reader reader{};
const auto on_payload = [&](std::span<const std::byte> payload) {
    elementary_stream.insert(elementary_stream.end(), payload.begin(), payload.end());
};
for (auto chunk = read_next_chunk(); !chunk.empty(); chunk = read_next_chunk()) {
    if (!reader.push(chunk, on_payload)) { /* ... */ }
}
if (!reader.finish(on_payload)) { /* ... */ }
```

`Reader::finish` takes the callback — unlike the Matroska and MP4 readers' — because it can
still emit: the unbounded PES form ends only at the next
`payload_unit_start_indicator` or at end of input, so the last payload of a capture is only
complete here.

**Untrusted input, and more so than the sibling formats.** A transport stream is designed to be
tuned into mid-flight and to survive bit errors, so "malformed" is the ordinary case here, not
the exceptional one. Every PSI section's CRC-32 (the non-reflected CRC-32/MPEG-2 variant,
self-checked against the standard test vector) is verified before the PAT/PMT it carries is
believed — a bit-damaged PMT is thrown away rather than locking onto a wrong PID for the rest of
the file. `ReadOptions` bounds the PES and PSI section sizes the reader will assemble (the
unbounded PES form has no ceiling of its own otherwise) and how far it will search for the packet
grid. `libs/containers/fuzz/fuzz_mpegts_demux.cpp` drives both entry points with arbitrary bytes — this is also
the container reader most likely to find a hang rather than a crash, since the sync
search, section reassembly and PES reassembly are all loops a hostile stream can try to stall.

## Fragmented MP4/CMAF + HLS/DASH: `iclforge::containers::mp4::fragment`, `iclforge/containers/mp4/hls.hpp`, `iclforge/containers/mp4/dash.hpp`

The streaming-delivery follow-up `iclforge::containers::mp4::mux`'s own header deliberately left for
later: `iclforge::containers::mp4::fragment` lays out the same track and frames as `mux`, but as a fragmented movie
(ISO/IEC 14496-12 §8.8's `moof`/`mfhd`/`traf`/`tfhd`/`tfdt`/`trun`) split into CMAF-shaped pieces
(ISO/IEC 23000-19) — an initialization segment (`ftyp`+`moov`, whose one `trak` carries
`mvex`/`trex` instead of a populated sample table, since a fragmented track's own `stbl`
describes zero samples) plus one or more media segments (`styp`+`moof`+`mdat`, one per fragment).
Same batch shape as `mux`: every frame is known up front, so real durations/timestamps are
filled in throughout, including the track's total duration in `mvhd`/`tkhd`/`mdhd`.
[`iclforge::containers::mp4::FragmentWriter`](#incremental-fragmenting-iclforgecontainersmp4fragmentwriter) below is the incremental form
for a live session, and that total duration is the one thing the two disagree about.

```cpp
const auto fragmented =
    iclforge::containers::mp4::fragment(track, frames, iclforge::containers::mp4::FragmentOptions{.frames_per_fragment = 8});
```

`FragmentedOutput::init_segment` and `::media_segments` are exactly the files a packager or CDN
origin wants (`init.mp4` plus `segment1.m4s`, `segment2.m4s`, ...) — see `forge fmp4`, which
writes them out that way alongside the manifests below.

`iclforge/containers/mp4/hls.hpp` and `iclforge/containers/mp4/dash.hpp` build HLS/DASH signaling for those same segments — one CMAF
segment format, two manifest flavors, the entire point of CMAF:

```cpp
const auto media_playlist =
    iclforge::containers::mp4::build_hls_media_playlist(track, fragmented->media_segments, iclforge::containers::mp4::HlsOptions{});
const auto master_playlist = iclforge::containers::mp4::build_hls_master_playlist(
    track, fragmented->media_segments, "audio.m3u8", iclforge::containers::mp4::HlsOptions{});
const auto dash_snippet = iclforge::containers::mp4::build_dash_adaptation_set(track, fragmented->media_segments);
const auto mpd = iclforge::containers::mp4::build_dash_mpd(track, fragmented->media_segments, dash_snippet);
```

A master playlist can carry more than one audio rendition in the same `#EXT-X-MEDIA` group,
which is what an Atmos asset needs (see the paired-rendition note below):

```cpp
const std::array<iclforge::containers::mp4::HlsRendition, 2> renditions{
    iclforge::containers::mp4::HlsRendition{.track = joc_track,
                      .segments = joc.media_segments,
                      .media_playlist_uri = "audio.m3u8",
                      .name = "Dolby Atmos",
                      .channels_attribute = "12/JOC",
                      .is_default = true},
    iclforge::containers::mp4::HlsRendition{.track = bed_track,
                      .segments = bed.media_segments,
                      .media_playlist_uri = "bed51/audio.m3u8",
                      .name = "5.1"}};
const auto master_playlist = iclforge::containers::mp4::build_hls_master_playlist(renditions);
```

Full program: [`examples/mux_fmp4.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/mux_fmp4.cpp).

Both manifest flavors get the `CODECS`/`codecs` attribute right: `iclforge::containers::mp4::hls_codec_string` (and
`build_dash_adaptation_set` internally) use the bare `ac-3`/`ec-3` sample-entry fourcc unmodified
as the RFC 6381 `'Codecs'` parameter — neither AC-3 nor E-AC-3 registers any of the
dot-separated profile/level fields RFC 6381 §3 makes room for (unlike e.g. `avc1.640028`), which
is confirmed against every real HLS manifest example
[Apple's HLS Authoring Specification for Apple
Devices](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/hls-authoring-specification-for-apple-devices)
shows. AC-4's string is the dotted one `iclforge::ac4::rfc6381_codec_string()` gives (`ac-4.02.01.00`),
which the caller puts in `AudioTrack::rfc6381`. Dolby Digital Plus with Atmos objects additionally needs `CHANNELS="<N>/JOC"` on the HLS
media rendition instead of a plain channel count, where N is the decodable object count
(`iclforge::ac3::io::ScannedStream::oba_complexity_index`, TS 103 420 §8.3.2's `complexity_index_type_a`)
— reiterated, with a worked example (`CHANNELS="12/JOC"`), by [Dolby's own Online Delivery Kit
documentation](https://ott.dolby.com/OnDelKits/DDP/Dolby_Digital_Plus_Online_Delivery_Kit_v1.5/Documentation/Content_Creation/SDM/help_files/topics/hls_c_hls_signal_atmos_ddp.html)
and shown verbatim in a real manifest (`CODECS="avc1.64001f,ec-3"` / `CHANNELS="12/JOC"`) by
[AWS MediaLive's own HLS+Atmos
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/medialive/latest/ug/feature-dolbyatmos.html). `iclforge::containers::mp4`
itself never reads that TS 103 420 object-layer syntax — `HlsOptions::channels_attribute` is
opaque to it, the same way `AudioTrack::codec_config` is; `forge fmp4` is the caller that
already has `oba_complexity_index` (it read it to build the `dec3` box) and supplies the string.

**The paired 5.1 rendition.** Apple's authoring specification also asks that an Atmos rendition
be accompanied by an equivalent 5.1 bitstream carrying `CHANNELS="6"` *in the same
`#EXT-X-MEDIA` group*, so a client that cannot render the object layer selects the bed rather
than the asset failing to play. Because JOC's bed already *is* the full mix, that companion
needs no re-encode: [`iclforge::ac3::io::strip_objects`](decoding.md#object-layer-strip) removes the
object layer from the same stream and leaves bit-identical bed audio. `forge fmp4 …
fallback-51` writes both — the Atmos rendition where it always was, the stripped one under
`bed51/`, and one master playlist listing both.

The DASH snippet describes exact per-segment durations with a `SegmentTemplate`/`SegmentTimeline`
(ISO/IEC 23009-1 §5.3.9.6) built from each segment's own duration, rather than one nominal
`duration` attribute assumed constant — segments are constant-duration except (as usual) a
possibly shorter final one, and a flat nominal duration is exactly what let a real player
(FFmpeg's own `dash` demuxer, while writing this module) compute one too many segments from
`mediaPresentationDuration` and request a segment number past the end.

### Atmos/JOC signalling: `ceao`, and the DASH descriptors

`iclforge/containers/mp4/dash.hpp` used to say there was no established DASH convention to point at for JOC, unlike
HLS's `CHANNELS="<N>/JOC"`. There is: DASH-IF IOP Part 8 v5.0.0 §5.3.2 names, for E-AC-3
carrying JOC, the two SupplementalProperty descriptors
[ETSI TS 103 420](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103400_103499/103420/01.02.01_60/ts_103420v010201p.pdf)
clause D.2 defines — `tag:dolby.com,2018:dash:EC3_ExtensionType:2018`, whose value "shall be the
three character string JOC" (§D.2.2.1), and
`tag:dolby.com,2018:dash:EC3_ExtensionComplexityIndex:2018`, whose value "shall be decimal
representation of the eight-bit element `complexity_index_type_a` in the EC3SpecificBox"
(§D.2.2.2). §5.3.3 adds that such a track "shall be constrained according to the CMAF specific
requirements as provided in ETSI TS 103 420 Annex E", where §E.5 requires the `ceao` compatibility
brand. `DashOptions::joc_complexity_index` writes the first pair;
`FragmentOptions::object_audio_brand` adds `ceao` to the `ftyp` and every `styp` alongside the
`iso6`/`cmfc` a fragmented CMAF track already declares (added, not substituted — §E.2 requires
ISO/IEC 23000-19 conformance on top of the profile).

The same §5.3.2 offers two AudioChannelConfiguration schemes for E-AC-3. With
`DashOptions::dolby_channel_configuration` empty, the Representation carries
`urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:ChannelConfiguration` with the track's channel count — what TS 103 420
§D.2.3's own example MPD writes. Set it to the four hex digits TS 102 366 clause I.1.2.1 defines
(the 16-bit channel-assignment word, left channel in the most significant bit, so 5.1 is `F801`)
and it carries the Dolby scheme instead. `iclforge::ac3::io::dash_channel_configuration` is the one place
that word is derived, beside `build_codec_config_box` and for the same reason: which locations a
stream carries is `acmod`/`lfeon`/`chanmap` syntax, and a manifest writer has no business
re-deriving AC-3 semantics. `forge fmp4`, the GUI and the live paths all supply it.

`FragmentOptions::object_audio_brand` and `DashOptions::joc_complexity_index` are caller-supplied
for the same reason `HlsOptions::channels_attribute` is — `iclforge::containers::mp4` never reads TS 103 420's object
layer, and the caller that scanned `oba_complexity_index` off the bitstream to build the `dec3`
box already has it.

### AC-4 fragments: sync samples, a time scale of its own, brands and descriptors

An AC-4 track (`iclforge::containers::mp4::kCodecAc4`, its `dac4` from `iclforge::ac4::build_dac4()`) fragments with four things an
AC-3 or E-AC-3 track never needs, each supplied by the caller, since `iclforge::containers::mp4` reads no AC-4 syntax:

- **Sync samples.** Only an I-frame decodes on its own, and ETSI TS 103 190-2 Annex E.2 and E.3
  make the I-frames the sync samples and start every fragment at one.
  `FragmentOptions::sync_samples` gives `fragment()` one flag a frame (each frame's
  `b_iframe_global`); a fragment then closes once it holds `frames_per_fragment` frames and the next
  frame is a sync sample, and every `trun` that holds a sample which is not one lists each sample's
  flags (`sample_is_non_sync_sample`, and `sample_depends_on` 1 for such a sample, ISO/IEC 14496-12
  §8.8.3.1). `FragmentWriter::push(frame, sync)` takes the same flag frame by frame. A first frame
  that is not a sync sample is `kInvalidOptions`.
- **The time scale.** `AudioTrack::timescale` sets `mdhd`'s, which the decode times, the segment
  durations and both manifests' timelines count in (`iclforge::containers::mp4::timescale_of()`): Table E.1's 240 000 at
  29.97, 59.94 and 119.88 fps, whose frames alternate in length at 48 000 Hz, and the sample rate
  elsewhere (`iclforge::ac4::media_timing()` gives both).
- **Brands.** `FragmentOptions::brands` lists a CMAF media profile's brands after `iso6` and `cmfc`
  in the `ftyp` and every `styp`: Annex H's `ca4m` and `ca4s` for an AC-4 track.
- **DASH descriptors.** `DashOptions::channel_configuration` replaces the Representation's
  AudioChannelConfiguration, and `DashOptions::supplemental_properties` adds SupplementalProperty
  descriptors, each a `iclforge::containers::mp4::Descriptor{scheme_id_uri, value}` with its attributes escaped:
  `iclforge::ac4::dash_channel_configuration()` gives Annex G's (Table G.1's CICP value, or the Dolby 2015
  scheme's word for a layout the table lacks) and `iclforge::ac4::dash_supplemental_properties()` the frame
  rate and a pre-virtualized presentation's signal (Annex G.3).

`forge fmp4`, and `record` and `live` with `codec=ac4 container=fmp4`, fragment AC-4 this way;
`iclforge::ac4::cmaf_refusal()` and `iclforge::ac4::configuration_difference()` say which streams Annex H.1.2 keeps out
of a CMAF track.

### Incremental fragmenting: `iclforge::containers::mp4::FragmentWriter`

Same header as `fragment`. The live counterpart, and `iclforge::containers::matroska::Writer`/`iclforge::containers::mpegts::Writer`'s
sibling: `create(track, options)` validates exactly what `fragment` validates and leaves
`init_segment()` ready to write once; each `push(frame)` buffers into the current fragment and
returns the media segment that just *closed* (so one comes back every
`frames_per_fragment`-th call, `std::nullopt` otherwise); `finalize()` flushes the trailing
partial fragment. `tfdt` comes from a running decode time held on the writer, which is the only
per-fragment state `fragment`'s own loop carries. Nothing beyond one fragment's frames and the
playlist window is ever held.

**The contract is byte-equality with the batch form**, the same one `iclforge::containers::mpegts::Writer` holds itself
to: for the same track, options and frames, the media segments this hands back are byte for byte
the ones `fragment` would have built. The initialization segment differs in exactly one respect —
`mvhd`/`tkhd`/`mdhd` carry duration 0, since a live session does not know its total (ISO/IEC
14496-12 §8.8.2 provides `mehd` for the fragmented movie that *does*). That is the same
concession `iclforge::containers::matroska::Writer` makes with EBML's unknown-size Segment and its omitted Duration.
Both halves are asserted in `libs/ac3/tests/test_fmp4.cpp`, the init segment by patching the
three duration fields back and then requiring full byte equality.

```cpp
auto writer = iclforge::containers::mp4::FragmentWriter::create(
    track, iclforge::containers::mp4::FragmentOptions{.playlist_window_segments = 20});
write("init.mp4", writer->init_segment());
for (const auto& frame : frames) {
    const auto closed = writer->push(frame);          // std::optional<MediaSegment>
    if (*closed) {
        write(std::format("segment{}.m4s", (*closed)->sequence_number), (*closed)->bytes);
        // Rebuild the manifests from the rolling window each time a segment closes.
        write("audio.m3u8", iclforge::containers::mp4::build_hls_media_playlist(track, writer->window(),
                                                          iclforge::containers::mp4::HlsOptions{.vod = false}));
        write("manifest.mpd",
              iclforge::containers::mp4::build_dash_mpd(track, writer->window(),
                                  iclforge::containers::mp4::build_dash_adaptation_set(track, writer->window()),
                                  iclforge::containers::mp4::MpdOptions{.is_static = false,
                                                  .availability_start_time = now_iso8601()}));
    }
}
```

`window()` hands back `SegmentInfo` — a `MediaSegment`'s bookkeeping without its bytes, so a
rolling window of hundreds of segments costs nothing to keep.
`FragmentOptions::playlist_window_segments` bounds it (0, the default, keeps every segment). All
three manifest builders take `SegmentInfo` spans, with `MediaSegment` overloads for batch
callers.

Live manifests differ from VOD ones only in what they omit and where they start.
`HlsOptions::vod = false` drops `#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD` and `#EXT-X-ENDLIST`, leaving
`#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE` — always the first *listed* segment's number — to tell a player that
segments have rolled off the front (RFC 8216 §6.2.2). On the DASH side `MpdOptions::is_static =
false` writes `type="dynamic"` with `availabilityStartTime`, `minimumUpdatePeriod` and
`timeShiftBufferDepth` and no `mediaPresentationDuration` — the attribute set TS 103 420 §D.2.3's
own example MPD carries — and the SegmentTemplate's `@startNumber` and the SegmentTimeline's
first `<S t="…">` both come from the window rather than being assumed to be the start of the
track. `iclforge::containers::mp4` has no clock (no file I/O, no time), so the caller supplies the timestamp strings;
that is also what keeps the manifests deterministic under test.

This is what `forge record`/`forge live` with `container=fmp4` and the GUI's live session with
**fragmented MP4/CMAF** selected write through: the directory is a servable live origin while the
session runs, and a closed VOD one afterwards. `Fmp4FolderWriter` (`apps/common`) scans an AC-3 or
E-AC-3 take's first frame for its track, and takes an AC-4 take's track, brands and manifest values
from its caller (`Fmp4FolderWriter::Track`), with each frame's sync flag.

### External validation

`iclforge::containers::mp4::fragment`'s ISOBMFF output and the HLS media playlist round-trip cleanly through FFmpeg's
own strict decode (`ffmpeg -v error -xerror -err_detect crccheck+bitstream+buffer+explode`) —
both the fragmented file (init segment concatenated with every media segment) and `audio.m3u8`
read back the exact original frame count and duration. The same holds for what `FragmentWriter`
streams, and for the DASH MPD: see [Validation](../verification.md#where-the-oracles-dont-reach)
for exactly what was and was not checked externally.

## Muxer errors

Every muxing entry point above returns `std::expected`, against a per-module `MuxError` enum
with its own `describe()`:

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| `iclforge::containers::matroska::MuxError` | `kNoFrames`; `kInvalidTrack` (zero/negative channels or sample rate, or an empty codec id); `kFrameTooLarge` (a single frame beyond what one SimpleBlock can carry). |
| `iclforge::containers::mp4::MuxError` | `kNoFrames`; `kInvalidTrack` (here: an unrecognised codec id — only `ac-3`/`ec-3`/`ac-4` are legal — or no `codec_config` payload, besides the zero-channel/rate cases); `kFileTooLarge` — `mdat` would need a 64-bit chunk offset (`co64`), which this module doesn't write, so whole-file offsets are 32-bit; `kInvalidOptions` (e.g. `FragmentOptions::frames_per_fragment == 0`, `sync_samples` of another length than the frames or whose first frame is not a sync sample, a brand that is not four characters, or `FragmentWriter::push` given a first frame that is not a sync sample). `iclforge::containers::mp4::FragmentWriter::create` returns the same two refusals as `fragment`, but never `kNoFrames`: a live writer stopped before its first frame simply has nothing to flush. |
| `iclforge::containers::mpegts::MuxError` | `kNoFrames` and `kInvalidTrack` as above; `kInvalidOptions` (PID collisions); `kFrameTooLarge` — one access unit too large for a PES packet's 16-bit length field. |

## Demuxer errors

Each module's `demux`/`Reader` returns `std::expected` against its own `DemuxError`, which has
its own `describe()` overload beside `MuxError`'s:

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| `iclforge::containers::mp4::DemuxError` | `kNotIsobmff`; `kTruncated`; `kMalformed` (a box, sample table or fragment layout that cannot be parsed); `kNoAudioTrack`; `kLimitExceeded`; `kMoovAfterMdat` (`Reader` only — the sample table follows the data it indexes; use `demux`). |
| `iclforge::containers::matroska::DemuxError` | `kNotMatroska` (no EBML header where one has to be); `kTruncated` (the input ends before any track was described — a cut *after* one is not an error, see above); `kMalformed` (a vint, element or block layout that cannot be parsed, including a lace whose declared sizes overrun its block); `kNoAudioTrack` (Tracks held nothing selectable, or the requested `track_number` is absent); `kLimitExceeded` (an element size or nesting depth beyond `ReadOptions`). |
| `iclforge::containers::mpegts::DemuxError` | `kNotTransportStream` (no 188/192/204-byte sync grid found within `ReadOptions::max_sync_search_bytes`); `kNoProgramme` (no PAT, or no PMT for the programme it named — including one whose CRC failed); `kNoAudioStream` (the PMT held no AC-3, E-AC-3 or AC-4 elementary stream under any of the four signalling forms); `kMalformed` (a PES or section layout that cannot be parsed); `kLimitExceeded` (a PES packet or PSI section beyond `ReadOptions`). |

## Bitstream sinks (`iclforge::audio`)

The pieces below are audio-hardware-facing rather than example-driven, so there's no compiled
`examples/` program to excerpt — this is reference prose pointing at the relevant header, plus
the platform and hardware-verification caveats [Validation](../verification.md) states about
each. All of them are gated by `iclforge::audio::audio_backend()`
(`iclforge/audio/audio_backend.hpp`), which reports whether capture, monitor playback and
passthrough are available on this build's platform, and why not when they aren't — this backs
the CLI's `UNAVAILABLE HERE` messaging for `devices`, `record`, `monitor`, `live`, `outputs`
and `play`.

### `iclforge::containers::iec61937` — S/PDIF burst packing and de-framing

`iclforge/containers/iec61937/iec61937.hpp`. Packs AC-3 or E-AC-3 elementary-stream frames into IEC 61937 burst
framing — the wrapper a compressed bitstream needs over PCM-shaped hardware/interfaces (S/PDIF,
HDMI) so a receiver recognizes it as AC-3/E-AC-3 rather than treating it as noisy PCM. AC-3
burst packing is byte-exact against FFmpeg's `spdif` muxer. E-AC-3 packing (`Eac3BurstPacker`)
— data type 0x15, the 24576-byte/4x-carrier-rate burst, multi-syncframe accumulation, `Pd` in
bytes not bits — is independently verified against both FFmpeg's `spdif_header_eac3` and
Microsoft's own IEC 61937 documentation (both fetched live and cross-checked against each
other, not recalled), plus round-trip and real-audio unit tests. This header only produces the
framed bytes; getting them onto real hardware is `PassthroughSink`, below.

**AC-4** travels in four burst types of its own, from IEC 61937-14: `Pc` data type 24 with
subdata types 0 to 3, which are AC-4, AC-4 HBR4, AC-4 HBR16 and AC-4 LD. `Ac4BurstPacker` packs one
sync frame to a burst, and a burst lasts as long as its frame, so the repetition period follows
the stream's frame rate. At 29.97, 59.94 and 119.88 fps a frame is not a whole number of IEC 60958
frames, and the periods of five bursts in a row follow the sequence Part 14's tables give. The type
sets the link: the content rate for AC-4 and AC-4 LD (48 kHz only), four times it for HBR4, and
sixteen times it on eight channels for HBR16. `ac4_burst_type_for()` picks the smallest type a
stream's largest frame fits. After each burst, `last()` reports its `Pc`, `Pd`, period, place in
its sequence and link rate; `wrap_ac4_stream` is the batch form. The packer is written from the
standard's text, and `iclforge-tests` checks its periods, sequences and `Pc` codes against a second
transcription of the tables. No device here accepts AC-4.

Part 14 leaves two choices, and the header says which reading the packer takes. It numbers the
five bursts of a sequence without saying which frame is data-burst 0: the packer places a frame by
its phase in the five-frame cycle of ETSI TS 103 190-2 clause 5.11, from its `sequence_counter`,
so a stream packed from any frame gives each frame the same period. And it gives `Pd` in bits for
AC-4 and AC-4 LD, where IEC 61937-2 Table 2 says bytes: the packer writes bits, and the reader
takes either, since the sync frame states its own length.

**De-framing** (the other direction) is `BurstReader`, `unwrap_stream` and
`PassthroughDetector`. `BurstReader` is a streaming `Pa`/`Pb`/`Pc`/`Pd` parser: data types 0x01
and 0x15 and AC-4's four types, both 16-bit word orders, the stuffing between bursts, `Pd`'s
different units, and E-AC-3's 4× carrier with its multi-syncframe bursts. Feed it carrier bytes in
whatever chunks the source produces and take elementary-stream bytes out; it holds one burst plus
the caller's chunk and nothing more, so a two-hour capture costs what a two-second one does.
`unwrap_stream` is the batch form, mirroring `wrap_stream`. `last_header()` gives each burst's
`Pc` fields, its `Pd` as written, and where in the carrier it started, which for AC-4 is how its
period can be measured.

The input is by definition untrusted — a burst carrier comes off a wire or out of a capture
device — so nothing taken from `Pd` is believed past its data type's repetition period, and a
preamble not backed by a syncframe (`0x0B77`, or AC-4's `0xAC40` or `0xAC41`) is treated as a false
match to resync past rather than a fatal error. An AC-4 burst's `Pd` also has to agree with the
length its sync frame states. `libs/containers/fuzz/fuzz_iec61937_unwrap.cpp` keeps that accurate, and feeds the
same bytes to the AC-4 packer.

This is also what closes the loop on the wrap side: bursts written by this project *and* by
FFmpeg's `spdif` muxer read back byte-exactly to the streams that went in, AC-3 and E-AC-3,
little-endian and big-endian carriers alike, and AC-4 bursts from `Ac4BurstPacker` read back to the
sync frames that went in, in all four types and at every frame rate. Backs `forge unspdif`.

`PassthroughDetector` answers the capture-side question — is this endpoint delivering PCM, or
somebody's bursts? — from the same interleaved float frames `iclforge::audio::Capture` delivers,
using `carrier_from_capture` to recover the PCM16 words exactly (every backend converts int16
to float by dividing by 32768, so nothing is lost). `forge record` uses it to write the
elementary stream instead of encoding noise; `forge live` uses it to stop rather than encode a
whole session of it.

### `iclforge::audio::PassthroughSink` — exclusive-mode passthrough

`iclforge/audio/passthrough.hpp`. Exclusive-mode/direct bitstream output, AC-3, E-AC-3 or AC-4 — WASAPI
on Windows, ALSA or PipeWire on Linux, CoreAudio on macOS, a JNI-bridged `AudioTrack` on Android —
the path an AV receiver needs to see the raw compressed bitstream rather than decoded PCM.

Like `MonitorSink` below, it reports where the device has got to (`position()`), and can
`flush()`, `pause()` and `resume()`. The position counts the content's frames, 1536 to a burst in
either format, although an E-AC-3 link runs at four times the content's rate. A pause stops the
link, and a receiver drops its lock when that happens, so the first moments after a resume can
be silent.

**AC-4.** `BitstreamFormat` names AC-4's three links: `kAc4` for AC-4 and AC-4 LD bursts at the
content rate, `kAc4Hbr4` at four times it, and `kAc4Hbr16` at sixteen times it on eight channels.
An AC-4 burst is as long as its frame's repetition period, so `submit()` takes any whole number of
link frames up to the longest (`burst_size_fits()`). Two platforms can send it: ALSA, and Android
through an `ENCODING_IEC61937` track, both of which take IEC 61937 bursts as opaque two-channel
data with the non-audio flag set, whatever codec they hold. WASAPI, PipeWire and Core Audio are
asked for a codec by name (a `KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_IEC61937_*` subformat, a SPA IEC 958 codec, an
`AudioFormatID`), and none of the three has a name for AC-4 in its current SDK, so `start()`
refuses AC-4 there with `kUnsupportedFormat`. Every backend refuses `kAc4Hbr16` the same way,
since none opens the eight-channel high-bit-rate link it needs.
`RenderDeviceInfo::supports_ac4_passthrough` says whether an endpoint takes the base link; no
platform reports whether the receiver decodes AC-4, and no receiver found so far does.

When the device goes away mid-stream (the cable pulled, the receiver switched off, the endpoint
disabled), the sink stops itself. `running()` turns false, `position()` reports nothing,
`submit()` and `can_submit()` refuse, `flush()` returns at once, and `pause()` and `resume()`
refuse with `kNotRunning`. A caller that retries `submit()` while the queue is full has to check
`running()` as well, because waiting does not bring a lost device back. `start()` can be called
again without a `stop()` first. The hidden `[passthrough-unplug]` case in `iclforge-tests` takes a
person through this on real hardware.

Stated plainly, because this project's docs don't soften verification gaps: of the desktop
platforms, only **Windows** has this sink confirmed against real bitstreaming hardware — an
Onkyo TX-RZ740 over an Nvidia GPU's HDMI output locks AC-3, E-AC-3 and signed Atmos through
`PassthroughSink` itself, not a workaround code path; see
[Windows](../platforms/windows.md#audio-backend-wasapi) for the full account, including two real
`PassthroughSink` defects that real hardware surfaced and this project fixed (a cross-thread
WASAPI crash and a stats bug that hung the CLI). Android has the same confirmation independently,
locking a real AV receiver onto real Atmos output over HDMI — see
[Android](../platforms/android.md). Linux and macOS remain unconfirmed against real bitstreaming
hardware; see each platform page for its own status.

### `iclforge::audio::sink_capabilities` — reading what a sink says it accepts

`iclforge/audio/sink_capabilities.hpp`. `read_sink_capabilities(device_id)` reads a
render endpoint's own advertised capabilities — CEA-861 Short Audio Descriptors, the part of
EDID (over HDMI) or ELD (ALSA's own EDID-Like Data, which carries the same SADs) that says which
codecs, how many channels and which sample rates a sink accepts — rather than
`enumerate_render_devices()`'s own live-probe answer (open the device and try). `forge play`
uses it, EDID first and the probe as the documented fallback, to decide whether a source format
needs the automatic AC-3/PCM fallback described in
[Commands → Following the sink](../forge/cli/commands.md#following-the-sink).

Real on two backends today:

- **ALSA** reads the HD-audio kernel driver's own `/proc/asound/<card>/eld#<dev>.<port>` text
  interface. It is already decoded from the raw CEA-861 bytes, so there is no byte layout for
  this project to get wrong, only the driver's own field names to read.
- **PipeWire** reads the session manager's reading of the same descriptor: the `iec958.codecs`
  property WirePlumber sets on a digital node from the sink's ELD. That gives the codecs (AC-3,
  E-AC-3, PCM) but no LPCM channel count or rates, which the property does not carry. A node
  without the property reports `kNoEdid`.

**Neither is verified against real HDMI/ELD hardware.** The development environment this shipped
from has no Linux box with a bitstream-capable receiver attached; see
[Linux](../platforms/linux.md) for the current status.

Every other backend (Windows, macOS, Android, and Linux with neither ALSA nor PipeWire) reports
`kNoBackend` rather than guessing. None has a documented user-mode API for reading a sink's raw
SADs: Windows' WASAPI and macOS' CoreAudio both answer negotiated-format questions, the kind
`enumerate_render_devices()` already answers, not the sink's own descriptor.

### `iclforge::audio::MonitorSink` — shared-mode monitor playback

`iclforge/audio/monitor.hpp`. The non-exclusive counterpart to `PassthroughSink`: shared-mode PCM
playback — WASAPI, ALSA, PipeWire, CoreAudio or AAudio on Android, resampled and mixed like any
other app — that decodes what is being
encoded and plays it back on an ordinary output, for previewing a decode without a
bitstream-capable receiver. Backs `forge monitor` and `live`'s monitor leg.

It stops itself when its device goes away, in the same way as `PassthroughSink`, and
`[monitor-unplug]` is its hidden case. A shared-mode stream that the platform moves to another
output keeps playing; PipeWire's session manager does this when a sink is removed.

`start()` also distinguishes a device that refused this shared-mode sample rate or channel count
(`MonitorError::kFormatRejected`) from every other WASAPI/ALSA/Core Audio failure
(`kComFailure`). Windows and ALSA check for it precisely — the one `AUDCLNT_E_UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT`
HRESULT, or the channel/rate `hw_params` calls specifically — while Core Audio groups its
channel-count and nominal-rate checks under the same code, since its property-set calls report
only success or failure and never why. PipeWire and AAudio never return it: both hand format
negotiation to a graph/mixer that converts rather than refuses, so there is no equivalent moment
to report. On Windows the stream asks the engine to resample and re-matrix it
(`AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_AUTOCONVERTPCM`), so a rate the endpoint's mix format lacks - a 44.1 kHz
stream on a 48 kHz endpoint - plays rather than being refused; without that flag shared mode
takes only the mix format's own rate and width.

Unlike passthrough, **this one is confirmed against real hardware.** It has actually played
decoded AC-3 and E-AC-3 (including an Atmos stream's 5.1 bed) through real Windows (Realtek)
hardware in real time, and a live microphone capture → encode → monitor session has run
end-to-end. Building this path against real hardware surfaced two bugs that neither
unit tests nor silent/synthetic input would have caught — see
[Windows](../platforms/windows.md#audio-backend-wasapi) for the details, and
`libs/audio/src/backend/windows/monitor.cpp` for the fixes.

## Capture: `iclforge::audio`

`iclforge/audio/capture.hpp`, `ring_buffer.hpp`. Live input/loopback capture — WASAPI on Windows,
ALSA or PipeWire on Linux, CoreAudio on macOS — through the lock-free SPSC ring in `ring_buffer.hpp`, which
sits between the audio callback and whatever consumes the samples (an encoder, a monitor sink,
or both). On macOS capture is input-only: no loopback endpoint is ever enumerated, and
`start()` refuses `DeviceKind::kLoopback` outright rather than silently opening a microphone.
This is what backs `forge record`/`live` and the GUI's live-session tab.

A third way in, `Capture::start_process_loopback(pid, mode, format)`, taps what
one process renders and nothing else, whichever endpoint it renders to — and it is the piece the
[Crucible](../crucible/index.md) is built on. Three backends have one, over three
different mechanisms: Windows 10 build 20348+'s process-loopback activation, a PipeWire capture
stream linked to one application node, and (macOS 14.2+) a Core Audio process tap carried by a
private aggregate device. Only Windows walks the target's children, which is why
`ProcessLoopbackMode`'s "tree" reads literally there and as "this process" elsewhere.

It differs from an endpoint loopback in ways worth knowing before relying on it. The caller states
the format, because there is no endpoint whose mixer format could be asked for — 48 kHz float
stereo is the default, and eight channels is honoured on Windows, where the audio engine
converts; the macOS tap has no converter behind it and refuses anything but mono or stereo, at
its own rate (see [macOS](../platforms/macos.md)). On Windows a muted audio session taps as
silence, because the tap sits after session volume, and a tap outlives its process delivering
zeros, so "the process stopped playing" has to come from the audio session list rather than from
the capture. Refusals are `kProcessLoopbackUnavailable` (no such tap on this platform, this
Windows build or this macOS version — and, on **every** macOS since 2026-09-06, because the path
is not entered by default: the one machine to run it never returned from
`AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID` on the tap's aggregate device, so `ICLFORGE_MACOS_PROCESS_TAP` is
what turns it back on. `process_loopback_available()` and `audio_backend().process_loopback` say
which of those it is, up front) and `kProcessNotFound`, which the library checks itself because
the OS does not.

`iclforge/audio/device_watcher.hpp`. `DeviceWatcher` delivers endpoint
added/removed/state-changed and default-changed events on a callback, so an application that
follows the sink can re-probe when something is plugged or unplugged instead of polling
`enumerate_render_devices()`. Three backends have one, each over its own mechanism: Windows'
`IMMNotificationClient`, one event per physical change (the console role only; Windows would
otherwise report every default change three times); PipeWire's registry plus the
`default.audio.sink`/`default.audio.source` metadata keys; and Core Audio property listeners on
`kAudioObjectSystemObject`, which report only that the device list changed and so are diffed
against a kept list of device UIDs. `kStateChanged` is a Windows event — on the other two an
endpoint that goes away leaves the list, and `kRemoved` already says so. The callback runs on a
platform thread under the watcher's own lock, which is what lets `stop()` promise no callback is
in flight when it returns; do the minimum there and never stop the watcher from inside it. ALSA
has no such API and the posix/android backends have no audio backend at all, so those three
refuse `start()` with `kNoBackend`.

## Metering: `iclforge::ac3::analysis`

`iclforge/ac3/analysis/levels.hpp`. Peak/RMS metering with console ballistics, plus the Gerzon energy
vector computed over the BS.775 ring — the metering `forge` and the GUI share so their two
displays never disagree about what a signal contains. One `LevelMeter` instance drives both: the
moving display (`levels()`, ballistic) and the exact end-of-run report (`summary()`,
unweighted), fed by the same pass over the samples.

```cpp
iclforge::ac3::analysis::LevelMeter meter{acmod, lfe, 48000};
meter.process(decoded_views);   // once per frame, planar A/52 order
```

```cpp
const auto& stats = meter.summary()[static_cast<std::size_t>(ch)];  // exact, not ballistic
fmt::printf("peak %.1f dBFS  rms %.1f dBFS\n", stats.peak_db(), stats.rms_db());

const auto energy = iclforge::ac3::analysis::energy_vector(meter.levels(), acmod);
```

Full program: [`examples/level_metering.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/level_metering.cpp)
— decodes a 5.1 stream and reports both the per-channel peak/RMS and the soundfield's energy
vector.

This is a separate concern from the BS.1770 integrated-loudness measurement in
`iclforge::ac3::meta::LoudnessMeter` (see [Metadata](metadata.md)): one is instantaneous display
metering, the other the gated whole-programme measurement `dialnorm` is derived from.
`energy_vector` is computed from the integrated RMS of the full-bandwidth channels only — the
LFE has no direction to contribute, and a subwoofer's level would otherwise swamp the sum.
