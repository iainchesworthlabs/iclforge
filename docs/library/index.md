# Using the libraries

`iclforge::ac3` is the C++23 codec library used by Forge, Crucible, and Hearth. It encodes and
decodes AC-3 and E-AC-3, including E-AC-3 streams with Dolby Atmos objects represented through
Joint Object Coding (JOC). It also provides loudness metering, level analysis, and quality
measurement. It links five libraries that know no codec: `iclforge::base`, `iclforge::dsp`,
`iclforge::objects`, `iclforge::render` and `iclforge::iec61937`. AC-4 has libraries of its own
beside it, which share no code with it ([AC-4](ac4.md)).

Other targets provide container writing, IAB and ADM/BW64 reading, IAMF reading and writing, object signing,
platform audio, and AC-4 decoding and encoding. Build and linkage requirements differ by target.
[Capabilities](capabilities.md) lists supported formats and limits;
[Development status](development-status.md) is the compact done / partial / not-started companion.
[Validation](../verification.md) describes how output is checked.

Use this page to link the C++ library. Other interfaces are documented under the
[C API](c-api.md), [Python](python-api.md), [Rust](rust-api.md), and
[WebAssembly](../platforms/wasm.md) pages. Packages are listed under
[Releasing](../releasing.md#what-gets-published).

Every library has its own header directory, `src/<name>/include/iclforge/<name>/`, spelled
`iclforge/<name>/...` in an `#include`; the [header map](header-map.md) lists what is where. The
main codec headers are under `src/ac3/include/iclforge/ac3/`, and the AC-4 headers under
`src/ac4/include/iclforge/ac4/`, `src/ac4dec/include/iclforge/ac4dec/` and
`src/ac4enc/include/iclforge/ac4enc/`.

`iclforge::adm` and `iclforge::admbridge` need the root dependency manifest's `adm` feature
(`-DVCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES=adm`) when building this repository with vcpkg, and are installed as
shared libraries. The packaged `iclforge` port has no `adm` feature and does not package either
target. Their [ADM](adm.md) and [ADM bridge](adm-bridge.md) pages explain the dependency and
linkage details.

The AC-4 libraries are installed and exported as one set: `iclforge::ac4dec_static` and
`iclforge::ac4dec_shared`, and `iclforge::ac4enc_static` and `iclforge::ac4enc_shared`, each linking
`iclforge::ac4_static` or `iclforge::ac4_shared`. The static decoder and encoder call into
`iclforge::ac4core`, an archive with no headers that their exported targets name as a link-only
dependency; [AC-4](ac4.md#linking) has the detail.

`iclforge::arithmetic` (header-only) is built in-tree and not installed; `iclforge::audio` and
`iclforge::sendspin` are not installed either (see the end of this page).

**In-tree** (this repo `add_subdirectory`'d into a larger build, or as a git submodule):

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE iclforge::ac3)
```

`iclforge::ac3` resolves to whichever of the static or shared build the enclosing project's
`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` asks for.

**Installed package**, from an `iclforge-dev-*` package (see
[docs/releasing.md](../releasing.md#what-gets-published)) or a local `cmake --install`:

```cmake
find_package(iclforge REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE iclforge::ac3_static)   # or iclforge::ac3_shared
```

An installed package has no ambient `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` default to resolve against, so it
exports both variants explicitly rather than a bare `iclforge::ac3` — pick the one you want.
The package has nothing for a consumer to find: no `find_dependency()` calls, no system or
third-party library to resolve, static or shared. The codec is not dependency-free, though —
`iclforge::ac3` and `iclforge::mp4` use {fmt} for formatting (`cmake/Fmt.cmake`, and this repo's own
`vcpkg.json`; it stands in for `<format>`, which NDK r26's libc++ does not implement). Both
compile a private copy of it into their own object files (`FMT_HEADER_ONLY`, in its own inline
namespace `fmt::ac3_private`, through the `iclforge::fmt_private` target wrapped in
`$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>`) and link no {fmt} library, so the export graph names none and the
archive and the shared library each hold all of {fmt} that they call. That is what leaves the
installed package with nothing to declare. A consumer needs no {fmt} of its own, and one that has
its own, of any version, never binds to the private copy. It matters most for the static variants.
A shared library takes a linked {fmt} in at its own link step, but an archive is not linked at
all: one that had linked {fmt} would leave every consumer an unresolved `fmt::v12::vprint`, which
only the same major version of {fmt} can supply.

What a static variant does leave to the consumer's link is the C++ runtime. A CMake project links
an installed static `iclforge::` target with the C++ driver when it enables the CXX language, so a C
program using `iclforge::c_static` needs `project(your_project LANGUAGES C CXX)`; that driver
supplies libm as well. With only C enabled the link goes through the C driver and stops at C++
runtime symbols such as `operator new`, although the exported target records that it holds C++
objects (`IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES`). A build outside CMake gets them from the `.pc`
files (see pkg-config below), or adds them to the link line itself (`-lstdc++ -lm` with libstdc++,
`-lc++ -lm` with libc++).

`iclforge::adm`/`iclforge::admbridge` are the exception: they PRIVATE-embed the third-party
libbw64/libadm (Apache-2.0, FetchContent'd — see [ADM / BW64 reading](adm.md)), neither of which
this project installs or exports in its own right, so the installed package only ever exports
their **shared** variant (`iclforge::adm_shared`/`iclforge::admbridge_shared`, plus the bare
`iclforge::adm`/`iclforge::admbridge` alias — there is no `_static` counterpart here, unlike every
other module on this page) regardless of `ICLFORGE_INSTALL_BOTH_LINKAGES`. A self-contained
`.so` absorbs libbw64/libadm at its own build step; a static archive would leave a downstream
consumer with unresolved symbols into a library this package doesn't ship. `iclforge::adm`
still needs Boost at build time (see the note above) — that requirement doesn't go away just
because the *installed* artifact is self-contained.

`iclforge::signing` follows this exact same shape — mandatory, not gated by an
`ICLFORGE_BUILD_<NAME>` switch, same as `iclforge::ac3` itself — so it resolves the identical way in
both cases: the bare `iclforge::signing` alias in-tree, and explicit `iclforge::signing_static`/
`iclforge::signing_shared` from an installed package.

**vcpkg.** A port lives in this repo at
[`packaging/vcpkg-port/iclforge/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/tree/main/packaging/vcpkg-port/iclforge) and is pending
submission to the curated `microsoft/vcpkg` registry (see
[docs/releasing.md](../releasing.md#vcpkg-port)) — until that lands, point vcpkg at it directly
with `--overlay-ports`/`VCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS` (works from any clone of this repo, no waiting on
the upstream PR):

```bash
vcpkg install iclforge --overlay-ports=/path/to/iclforge/packaging/vcpkg-port
```

```cmake
find_package(iclforge CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE iclforge::ac3)
```

`iclforge::ac3` and the libraries it links (`base`, `dsp`, `objects`, `render`, `iec61937`), with
`iclforge::signing`, are what the port installs by default. Every other library is one of the
port's features, and none is on by default (a curated-registry port's `default-features` may only
cover behaviors, not additional public APIs/targets/binaries, and each of these is exactly that):

| Feature | Targets |
|---|---|
| `matroska` | `iclforge::matroska` |
| `mp4` | `iclforge::mp4` |
| `mpegts` | `iclforge::mpegts` |
| `capi` | `iclforge::c`, the C API (see [C API](c-api.md)) |
| `ac4` | `iclforge::ac4`, `iclforge::ac4dec` and `iclforge::ac4enc` (see [AC-4](ac4.md)) |
| `iab` | `iclforge::iab` (see [IAB](iab.md)) |
| `iamf` | `iclforge::iamf` (see [IAMF](iamf.md)) |

Opt in with `vcpkg install iclforge[matroska,mp4,mpegts]` for the three container writers, or any
subset, such as `iclforge[ac4]` for AC-4 alone. `iclforge::adm`/`iclforge::admbridge` have no vcpkg
feature — out of scope for this port, even though upstream installs and exports both
(shared-only, see the note above). Once merged into `microsoft/vcpkg`, the same two snippets work
with a plain `vcpkg install iclforge` — no `--overlay-ports` needed.

**Conan.** A recipe lives in this repo at
[`packaging/conan/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/tree/main/packaging/conan)
and is pending submission to ConanCenter (see
[docs/releasing.md](../releasing.md#conan-recipe)) — until that lands, `conan create
packaging/conan --version <tag>` from a clone of this repo builds it straight into your local
Conan cache, after which a consumer's `conanfile.txt`/`conanfile.py` `requires = "iclforge/<tag>"`
resolves it the same way a published package would. Same scope as the vcpkg port above, with an
option for each of its features: `capi`, `ac4`, `iab` and `iamf` off by default like the port's
(`-o "iclforge/*:ac4=True"` and the like to opt in), and `matroska`/`mp4`/`mpegts` on by default,
where the port has them off (`-o "iclforge/*:matroska=False"` etc. to drop one).
`tools/checks/check_packaging_versions.sh` holds the two recipes to the same components and the
same `ICLFORGE_BUILD_<NAME>` options. The same two `find_package`/`target_link_libraries`
snippets apply: the recipe installs `iclforge`'s own CMake package config rather than generating
a second one, so a Conan consumer's CMakeLists.txt looks identical to a vcpkg or plain-installed
one.

**pkg-config.** Every installed library also gets its own `.pc` file,
`${libdir}/pkgconfig/iclforge-<name>.pc` (`iclforge-base`, `-dsp`, `-objects`, `-render`,
`-iec61937`, `-ac3`, `-signing`, `-matroska`, `-mp4`, `-mpegts`, `-iamf`, `-iab`, `-adm`,
`-admbridge`, `-ac4`, `-ac4dec`, `-ac4enc`, `-ac4core` and `-c`), for a non-CMake consumer:

```bash
pkg-config --cflags --libs iclforge-ac3
```

Picks whichever linkage was actually installed (the shared name when
`ICLFORGE_INSTALL_BOTH_LINKAGES`/`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` selected it, else the `_static`-suffixed
one — matching what is actually on disk), and chains `Requires:` for a library that PUBLIC-
links another (`iclforge-ac3` requires `iclforge-base`, `-dsp`, `-objects`, `-render` and
`-iec61937`; `iclforge-signing` requires `iclforge-ac3`; `iclforge-admbridge` requires
`iclforge-ac3` and `iclforge-adm`; `iclforge-ac4dec` and `iclforge-ac4enc` require
`iclforge-ac4`). The `prefix=` line resolves relative to wherever the `.pc` file itself ends up
(`pkg-config`'s own `${pcfiledir}`), so it works the same whether that's a real system install or
an unpacked `iclforge-dev-*` archive.

A `.pc` that names a static archive lists what the archive needs in `Requires.private` and
`Libs.private`, and pkg-config puts those on the link line only when asked for `--static`. That is
the mode for an install that holds only the static libraries, the shape a vcpkg or Conan package
has:

```bash
cc consumer.c $(pkg-config --static --cflags --libs iclforge-c)
```

`iclforge-c.pc` requires `iclforge-ac3` privately, because `libiclforge_c_static.a` calls into
`libiclforge_ac3_static.a`, and `iclforge-ac4dec.pc` and `iclforge-ac4enc.pc` require
`iclforge-ac4core` privately, because `libiclforge_ac4dec_static.a` and
`libiclforge_ac4enc_static.a` call into `libiclforge_ac4core_static.a`. `iclforge-ac3.pc`,
`iclforge-matroska.pc`, `iclforge-mp4.pc`, `iclforge-mpegts.pc`, `iclforge-iamf.pc`,
`iclforge-iab.pc`, `iclforge-ac4.pc` and `iclforge-ac4core.pc` list the C++ runtime and libm in
`Libs.private`. A C compiler does not link them by itself, and a C++ compiler does. The names are
the ones CMake recorded for the compiler that built the archives: `-lstdc++ -lm` with libstdc++
and `-lc++ -lm` with libc++ on Linux. `iclforge-signing.pc` gets them through `iclforge-ac3`, and
`iclforge-ac4dec.pc` and `iclforge-ac4enc.pc` through `iclforge-ac4` and `iclforge-ac4core`. A
`.pc` that names a shared library has neither field: the library records what it needs, and
`libiclforge_c.so` holds its own copy of the codec, so it does not pull in `libiclforge_ac3.so`.
An install with both linkages, such as the `iclforge-dev-*` packages, names the shared libraries,
and `--static` does not switch to the archives, so name them yourself: `-liclforge_c_static`,
then the `_static` archive of each library its `Requires` chain names, a library before the ones
it uses (`iclforge_ac3_static`, `iclforge_render_static`, `iclforge_objects_static`,
`iclforge_dsp_static`, `iclforge_base_static` and `iclforge_iec61937_static`; a build with the
AC-4 libraries adds `iclforge_ac4dec_static`, `iclforge_ac4enc_static`, `iclforge_ac4_static` and
`iclforge_ac4core_static`), and `-lstdc++ -lm` at the end.

Live audio — capture, monitor playback, IEC 61937 passthrough — is `iclforge::audio`
(`src/audio/`), a separate target `forge`/`forge-gui` link alongside `iclforge::ac3` for their own
live-audio commands. It is **not** part of the distributed package: it isn't installed, isn't
exported, and `find_package(iclforge)` says nothing about it. A consumer wanting live capture
on their own platform provides their own audio I/O and feeds the resulting PCM to the codec API
below directly — `iclforge::audio` exists to serve this project's own CLI/GUI, not as something a
third party is expected to link.

Nearly every code block in this section is an excerpt from a program in
[`examples/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/tree/main/examples) — see
[Example programs](examples.md) for the full list. What the build compiles and `ctest` runs is
the programs, not the excerpts: an example cannot stop working silently, but an excerpt is
re-synced by hand and can drift. Each page's "Full program" link is the canonical form.

  `iclforge::ac4::Encoder`.
- [WebAssembly](../platforms/wasm.md) — the `iclforge-wasm-decoder` package, built
  from this tree and not on the npm registry: a
  push-frame decode API, an AudioWorklet playback pipeline, and an hls.js/MSE bridge over the
  decoder compiled to WASM, and wrappers for the AC-4 decoder and encoder.

## Conventions

These hold across the whole API.

**Errors are `std::expected`.** Nothing throws for a stream-level or configuration problem.
`FrameError` covers encoding, `DecodeError` decoding, `ScanError` scanning, `WavError` file
I/O, `MuxError` muxing. All five have a `describe()` returning a `std::string_view`. The AC-4
libraries do the same with `iclforge::ac4::Error`, `iclforge::ac4::DecodeError` and `iclforge::ac4::EncodeError`, which are not
`iclforge::ac3::DecodeError` and `iclforge::ac3::FrameError` under other names ([AC-4](ac4.md#errors)).

**Namespaces follow the libraries.** Everything is under `iclforge::`, and a library's public
headers declare into the namespace named for it: `iclforge::ac3` for the AC-3, E-AC-3 and Atmos
codec, `iclforge::ac4` for the four AC-4 libraries, and `iclforge::mp4`, `iclforge::matroska`,
`iclforge::mpegts`, `iclforge::iamf`, `iclforge::iab` and `iclforge::adm` for the containers and
the readers, which know nothing about AC-3, E-AC-3 or Atmos: they take frames as opaque bytes. The
codec's sub-namespaces keep their names under its own: `iclforge::ac3::eac3`, `iclforge::ac3::oba`,
`iclforge::ac3::io`, `iclforge::ac3::meta`, `iclforge::ac3::plan`, `iclforge::ac3::verify`,
`iclforge::ac3::quality` and `iclforge::ac3::analysis`. The libraries split from it have a
namespace of their own, `iclforge::base`, `iclforge::render`, `iclforge::dsp` and
`iclforge::iec61937`, and the objects library declares `iclforge::oba` and `iclforge::emdf`.
Five names are declared both by another library under `iclforge::` and by the codec under
`iclforge::ac3::`: `oba`, `emdf`, `render`, `internal` and `detail`. Inside `iclforge::ac3` an
unqualified `oba::` is the codec's, so the objects library's `Position` is written
`iclforge::oba::Position` there. The directory and the header root say which library a header is
in, and so does the namespace; `tools/checks/check_namespaces.py` holds the headers to it, with
three exceptions it lists as debts (`BitReader` and `BitWriter` of `iclforge/base/`, and `dft512`
of `iclforge/dsp/fft.hpp`, which are declared in `iclforge` itself).

Within the AC-3 codec, AC-3 is the base case and lives in `iclforge::ac3` itself; E-AC-3 additions and
overrides live in `iclforge::ac3::eac3`, nested rather than parallel. `iclforge::ac3::FrameEncoder` (AC-3) and
`iclforge::ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder` (E-AC-3) sharing a class name across that boundary is this rule applied
consistently — the same split the Python bindings mirror by putting the E-AC-3
encoder in a real `eac3` submodule rather than a same-module name that would collide.

**Audio is `float`, nominally in [-1, 1).** Internally the transform runs in `double` in an
ordinary build; `ICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR` and `ICLFORGE_ENCODE_SCALAR` choose `float` or, for the
decoder, fixed point on parts that need it ([Building](../building.md)). The AC-4 decoder builds in
`double` or `float` (a `fixed` request gives it `double`), and the AC-4 encoder always in `double`.

**Channels are passed as `std::span<const std::span<const float>>`.** The inner spans must
outlive the call. Build the outer vector once and refill the buffers underneath it — a fresh
vector of spans per frame is a pure waste.

**Channel order is A/52 Table 5.8, not WAV order.** That is `L, C, R, SL, SR` with LFE last,
against WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE's `FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR`. `iclforge::ac3::io::ac3_layout_for` and
`iclforge::ac3::io::wav_channel_order` give you the permutation both ways; use them rather than writing
it out again. AC-4 uses neither: `iclforge::ac4::Decoder` writes `L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs` and then the
layout's remaining pairs, each channel named in `DecodedFrame::speakers`, and `iclforge::ac4::Encoder` takes
the same order.

**Encoders are stateful and per-stream.** They carry MDCT overlap, the 44.1 kHz rate
accumulator, and the DRC and heavy-compression controllers, all of which smooth across frames.
One encoder per stream, fed in order. The decoders are stateful the same way (overlap-add and
dither state). No encoder or decoder instance is safe for concurrent calls on the same
instance — the headers note that per-frame scratch and history members are reused across
calls — but separate instances share nothing and are independent.

**Each `encode_frame` call takes exactly one frame of PCM per channel.** For AC-3 that is always
`iclforge::ac3::kSamplesPerFrame` (1536); for E-AC-3 it is `FrameEncoder::samples_per_frame()`, which is
1536 unless `FrameConfig::numblkscod` shortens the syncframe (256, 512 or 768 — see
[Encoding E-AC-3](encoding-eac3.md)). Short-changing it is a programming error, not a runtime
one.

**Every class with non-trivial state hides it behind a pimpl.** `struct Impl;
std::unique_ptr<Impl> impl_;` is the only private member on `FrameEncoder`
(both codecs), `FrameDecoder`, `Eac3Decoder`, `oba::AtmosEncoder`,
`eac3::AccessUnitEncoder`, `meta::RangeController`/`HeavyCompressor`,
`meta::LoudnessMeter`, `analysis::LevelMeter`, `iec61937::Eac3BurstPacker`, `iclforge::ac4::Decoder`,
`iclforge::ac4::Encoder` and the three `io::Wav*` classes that started the pattern — adding a buffer or
growing a scratch array changes only `Impl`, defined in the `.cpp`, so it is
never an ABI break for a caller linking `iclforge::ac3_shared`. The plain
config aggregates (`EncoderConfig`, `DecoderConfig`, `AtmosConfig`,
`FrameConfig`, `AccessUnitConfig` and the AC-4 encoder's and decoder's own) are the deliberate exception: callers build
them with designated initializers, so they stay ordinary value types rather
than opaque handles, and that ergonomics is worth more than hiding four or
five `double`s. Their layout is what `SameMajorVersion` actually has to
promise once 1.0 ships: a config struct's fields are frozen at the release
that adopts full-version `SOVERSION`, and a field added afterward needs either
a major version bump or an additive extension point (a reserved trailing
field, or a new sibling struct referenced by pointer) rather than an in-place
insert, which would silently shift every later field's offset for anyone who
has not recompiled. The `verify::*Trace*`/`FrameSyntax*` pointers a few of
them carry (`EncoderConfig::trace`, `DecoderConfig::trace`/`eac3_trace`/
`syntax`, `FrameConfig::trace`) are non-owning observers into internal
instrumentation headers, not part of the frozen public surface themselves —
adding, removing or retyping one of those pointers is not a promise this
convention covers.
