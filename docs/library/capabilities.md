# Capabilities and limitations

What the library encodes, decodes, inspects and measures, with the spec sections each claim
comes from, and the two limitations that shape how the output can be used. These tables are the
project's capability record: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../contributing.md) makes this page and
[Validation](../verification.md) the authority, so a new capability or a newly found limitation
lands here first and everything else summarises it.

For a compact done / partial / not-started view across every codec and bitstream feature, see
[Development status](development-status.md) — a parallel summary of this page, not a second
authority. That page also carries a [standards cross-check](development-status.md#standards-cross-check)
register of open gaps against the cited specs.

Everything below is the library and the shared audio layer beneath it — `iclforge::ac3`, its
siblings, and `iclforge::audio`, which belongs to the family rather than to any one member and is
never installed. [Forge](../forge/index.md) (`forge` and `forge-gui`) and
[Crucible](../crucible/index.md) reach the codec through the public API described under
[What it is](index.md), and link `iclforge::audio` directly.
The [application coverage matrix](application-coverage.md) shows which of these broad
capabilities each application exposes.

## What it does

### Encoding

This table is AC-3 and E-AC-3. The AC-4 encoder is the `iclforge::ac4`, the encoder row of [Other](#other).

| | AC-3 (bsid 8) | E-AC-3 (bsid 16) |
|---|---|---|
| Coding modes | 1+1 dual mono, 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 2/1, 3/1, 2/2, 3/2, each with or without LFE (1+1 never carries one) | the same, plus 7.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.4 and 7.1.4 through dependent substreams |
| Programmes per stream | one | up to eight independent substreams can be **authored** (§E2.3.1.2's I0–I7) — each with its own layout, dialnorm and full `mixmdate`/`bsmod` metadata via `programmeN=` (sample rate and block count are shared across every programme in a stream — §E2.3.1.2 requires it). Receiver-side use of that metadata (actually combining an associated service with the main programme during mixdown) is not implemented yet |
| Sample rates | 48, 44.1, 32 kHz | 48, 44.1, 32 kHz, plus the `fscod2` half rates 24, 22.05, 16 kHz (Annex E only) |
| Bit rates | CBR only — the 19 nominal rates of Table 5.18, 32–640 kbps | CBR (the same 19, per substream) or VBR — a quality target with optional min/max kbps bounds, per substream |
| Transform | long (512-point) or short (2x256-point) blocks, KBD window, chosen per block per channel by a §8.2.2 transient detector | same |
| Exponents | D15 / D25 / D45, strategy chosen per block from the reuse span (§8.2.8) | the same span rule, per channel per frame, written either as a Table E2.10 code (`expstre` 0) or as per-block strategies (`expstre` 1) — whichever the plan needs |
| Coupling | yes (§7.4), begin and end frequencies auto or pinned | yes (§E3.3) |
| Tool selection | coupling/rematrixing/delta always automatic, no toggle | `auto` picks coupling, spectral extension and AHT per frame from the per-channel rate **and** the frame's own spectrum — see [Encoding E-AC-3](encoding-eac3.md#how-auto-chooses) |
| Bit allocation parameters | §8.2.12's basic-encoder set with one measured departure, `dbpbcod` 3 | the same set, transmitted rather than inherited (`bamode` 1, 17 bits a frame) — Table E1.4's own defaults differ from §8.2.12's |
| Delta bit allocation | automatic (§7.2.2.6), like rematrixing below — no toggle | automatic, same as AC-3 |
| Dither substitution | `dithflag` decided per channel per block from content (§7.3.4) | the same, except in a frame using spectral extension |
| Rematrixing | yes, 2/0 (§7.5.3 minimum-power rule) | yes, 2/0 — the same rule, over Table 7.25's bands clamped to wherever coupling or spectral extension takes over |
| Annex E tools | — | spectral extension (§E3.6), enhanced coupling (§E3.5), adaptive hybrid transform with GAQ (§E3.4), transient pre-noise processing (§3.7) |
| Objects | panned to a 5.1 bed (no metadata survives) | OAMD + JOC in an EMDF container (TS 103 420) |

At 44.1 kHz, CBR needs non-integral frame sizes; the AC-3 encoder alternates between the two
Table 5.18 lengths on a Bresenham accumulator so the long-run rate is exact. E-AC-3 signals
`frmsiz` directly and needs no such alternation.

**Block switching's scope**: a §8.2.2 transient detector (cascaded biquad 8 kHz high-pass, a
256/128/64-sample peak-ratio tree) runs per full-bandwidth channel per block; a channel that
switches anywhere in the frame is excluded from coupling for that whole frame. On AC-3 that
exclusion is per channel — `chincpl` is a per-channel field, so the rest of the frame still
couples — while E-AC-3's coupling decision, and AHT on both, remain frame-wide all-or-nothing.
The LFE never switches (§8.2.2 defines the detector over full-bandwidth channels only).

**Dither's scope**: a bin the allocator gave no bits to is not transmitted, so the decoder
invents it — a true zero when `dithflag` is clear, a random sample scaled to that bin's own
exponent when it is set (§7.3.4). Both are wrong, in opposite directions: a run of true zeros is
a hole in the spectrum, and dither over a bin that really was near-silent is noise added to
nothing. The encoders decide per channel per block by comparing the two — the energy the decoder
will *not* receive against the energy the dither would put there instead — and dither only where
what is being replaced was at least as loud as the substitute. Digital silence is the limiting
case and always reads clear. A block-switched channel never dithers either, on the same grounds
Dolby's own encoder appears to use (`dithflag` is exactly `!blksw` in every block of the
reference stream in `testdata/external-baseline/`): a switched block's coefficient set is two
interleaved half transforms, so filling a zero-bit slot spreads noise across the transient the
switch exists to resolve. On E-AC-3 dither also stays off for any frame using spectral
extension — the encoder holds a reconstruction of the decoder's output there to scale the
extension bands, and the decoder's dither sequence is not reproducible from the encoder's side.

**Delta bit allocation's scope**: the encoder compares the coarse exponent-only masking curve
§7.2.2.2-7.2.2.5 derive against one built from the real, pre-quantization coefficient magnitude,
and corrects bands where the two clearly diverge (at least a full 6 dB Table 5.17 step). It is
skipped for the LFE channel (no such field exists for it). The coupling channel is in
§7.2.2.6's scope like any full-bandwidth channel on both generations, and `cpldeltbae` is
emitted whenever correction segments exist. Coupling no longer suppresses it on E-AC-3: a
coupled channel's own below-`cplstrtmant` baseband carries corrections like any other region.
Two narrowings remain there. An AHT stream carries none — the comparison was put on the AHT
axis, where its exponents actually live, and measured worse on every AHT-carrying point, because
the transform's job is to concentrate six blocks into one coefficient and the gap that opens is
that concentration rather than quantization error. And whether corrections are sent at all is
decided per frame against the rate fit: the frame is fitted with and without them and the higher
composite SNR offset wins, which is what keeps their side information from eating a 128 kbit/s
5.1 frame whose mantissas are already down to about a quarter of it. The decoder accepts delta
bit allocation on any channel, either generation, from any encoder.

### Metadata

These fields are AC-3 and E-AC-3's. AC-4's loudness, DRC, downmix, dialogue enhancement and
presentation metadata is under [AC-4](ac4.md#what-the-decoder-reports) and, for the encoder,
[Encoding a stream](ac4.md#encoding-a-stream).

| Field | Section | What it does here |
|---|---|---|
| `dynrng` | §7.7.1 | Per-block dynamic range control from an RMS-detected compressor on a piecewise-linear curve. Five profiles: `film-standard`, `film-light`, `music-standard`, `music-light`, `speech`. A/52 fixes the wire format and the intent but not the curve, so the profiles are this project's, not the standard's. |
| `compr` | §7.7.2 | Heavy compression as a limiter guaranteeing a peak ceiling in the §7.8 mono downmix. Rounds down, because nearest-code rounding can overshoot a ceiling by half a step. Its peak detector includes the previous frame's MDCT overlap. |
| `dialnorm` | §5.4.2.8 | Measured with ITU-R BS.1770-4 gated loudness and negated, or set directly. A/52 predates BS.1770 and leaves the measurement open. |
| Downmix levels | Tables 5.9/5.10, E1.2, D2.2–D2.6 | `cmixlev`/`surmixlev` in AC-3's own bsi; separate Lt/Rt and Lo/Ro levels plus a preferred-downmix indication in E-AC-3's `mixmdate` and in AC-3's Annex D `xbsi1`. |
| Programme mixing | Table E1.2, §E2.3.1.12–61 | The rest of `mixmdate`, written by the independent substream: programme and external-programme scale factors, the `mixdef` mixing-parameter block (premix compression, per-channel external scales, speech enhancement data), pan position for a mono or 1+1 programme, and per-block mixing configuration. This is what a receiver mixes an audio-description or commentary service against the main programme with. |
| Service and production | §5.4.2.2–28, Table E1.2 | `bsmod` (complete main through commentary and emergency — what ATSC A/53 and DVB key associated-service handling off), `dsurmod`, `dsurexmod`, `dheadphonmod`, `adconvtyp`, `audprodie`'s mixing level and room type, `copyrightb`, `origbs`, `langcod`, the 28-bit time code, and E-AC-3's `sourcefscod`. AC-3 carries them in bsi (the Surround EX, Headphone and A/D flags only under Annex D); E-AC-3 gathers the same set into `infomdat`. |
| Annex D alternate syntax | Annex D, `bsid` 6 | AC-3's two 14-bit `timecod` fields "have never been applied for their originally anticipated purpose" (§D1), so a `bsid`-6 stream spends them on `xbsi1`/`xbsi2` instead. Encode and decode both sides; §D3.2's promise holds, in that a legacy reader takes those bits for a time code it already ignores. |

### Decoding

This section is the AC-3 and E-AC-3 decoders. AC-4 has its own, the `iclforge::ac4`, the decoder row of
[Other](#other).

The in-repo decoder shares its tables, bit-allocation engine, exponent decoding and IMDCT with
the encoder. It reads AC-3 (bsid ≤ 8) and E-AC-3 (bsid 11–16), including dependent substreams,
`chanmap`, and the §E3.8.2 render that lays a dependent's channels over the bed. A stream
carrying more than one programme is decoded one programme at a time — `DecoderConfig::programme`
picks which — since independent substreams are alternatives rather than layers. Every Annex E
coding tool decodes too — standard coupling (§E3.3), enhanced coupling (§E3.5, a full FFT-based
phase-restoring reconstruction over 22 sub-bands), spectral extension (§E3.6, including the
pseudo-random noise blend the standard requires but leaves the exact generator unspecified), the
adaptive hybrid transform with GAQ (§E3.4), and transient pre-noise processing (§3.7) —
individually or all stacked together, at every channel layout including 7.1.4.

Transient pre-noise processing holds 1536 samples back per substream that uses it - one frame at
six blocks a syncframe (see [What it does not do](#what-it-does-not-do)) - and that holding-back
is not just a `decode_substream` detail:
`Eac3Decoder::decode_access_unit` assembles a whole access unit correctly even when only some of
its substreams set the flag, queuing whichever substreams release early rather than losing or
misaligning them against the one still catching up.

Downstream of the coded channels there is an **output stage** (`iclforge/ac3/decoder/output.hpp`), off by
default so the decoders stay usable as a reference: §5.4.2.8 dialnorm normalisation onto the
−31 dBFS reference, §7.8's Lo/Ro, Lt/Rt and mono downmixes driven by the stream's own
`cmixlev`/`surmixlev` or `mixmdate` levels, optional LFE mixing, and §7.7's line and RF operating
modes — RF including the overload protection a fold needs but `compr` (which is computed for the
*mono* downmix) does not provide. Lt/Rt's surround sum is phase shifted 90°. Layouts
§7.8 has no fold for, because they predate nothing that could code them, are reduced to the
nearest acmod layout first rather than having their extra channels dropped. Verified against
FFmpeg's `-ac 2` decode of the same stream.

§7.10 **error concealment** is opt-in on the same config. A frame that will not decode can be
reconstructed from the previous block's overlap — repeated and faded, or muted through the
codec's own window — instead of leaving a hard discontinuity in the PCM, with the substitution
reported on the result. For E-AC-3, an access unit whose *dependent* substream will not decode
renders its bed rather than failing outright.

`DecoderConfig::diagnostics` is a **consumer-facing diagnostic sink** — a plain function pointer,
no allocation, usable from the minimum-footprint decoder profile — for the recoverable events
that concealment's own return value does not carry: a CRC that failed (reported the moment the
check runs, whether or not concealment goes on to recover the frame) and an EMDF payload id this
decoder does not interpret (§H.2.2, skipped without failing the frame). Null by default, at the
cost of one branch per occurrence when it is not set.

### Inspection

Decoding a stream and *describing* one are different jobs. `iclforge::ac3::io::probe` (`forge probe`)
does the second: it reads the bitstream and reports what the stream declares — bsid, sample
rate including Annex E's `fscod2` half rates, `acmod`/`lfeon` and the resolved layout, `bsmod`,
`chanmap`, the substream map, `numblkscod`, frame and access-unit counts, duration, measured bit
rate and VBR spread, `dialnorm`/`compr`/`dynrng` presence and ranges, EMDF payload ids, OAMD/JOC
with `complexity_index` and the object/bed configuration, whether an authenticity tag is present,
CRC validity per frame, and how often each coding tool was used — without reconstructing a single
sample.

It reads in two tiers. `iclforge::ac3::io::read_frame_header` answers for every syncframe whether or not
its audio is readable, so a stream this decoder refuses is still described in full; the real
decoders then run under `DecoderConfig::skip_reconstruction`, which parses every field exactly
as a full decode does but stops before the inverse transform, for everything only the bitstream
body carries. An opt-in per-block dump reports which Annex E tools each block used and what
exponent strategy each stream carried — the in-repo counterpart of
`tools/references/eac3_parse.py`, which until now was the only field-level dump in the project
and shipped with nothing.

`json=1` emits a versioned JSON document instead of the table; its schema is a stable contract,
documented in [Commands](../forge/cli/commands.md). Memory is flat in the length of the stream on both
sides — the input is pulled through a fixed window and the per-frame dump is written as the walk
produces it.

### Research trace export

`iclforge::ac3::verify::FrameTrace`/`Eac3AccessUnitTrace` (`iclforge/ac3/verify/mirror.hpp`, `.../eac3_mirror.hpp`)
were built for the in-repo encoder/decoder mirror self-check, but a decode alone fills them just
as well — attach one to `DecoderConfig::trace`/`eac3_trace` and it comes back holding per-block,
per-stream exponents, bit allocation pointers, the §7.2.2.6 masking curve and the composite SNR
offset. `iclforge/ac3/verify/trace_export.hpp`'s `append_trace_csv`/`append_trace_json_lines` turn that into
one tidy row per (frame, substream, block, stream, kind, index, value) — `kind` distinguishes the
per-*bin* `exponent`/`bap` curves from the per-*band* `mask` one and the per-stream `snr_offset`
scalar, rather than forcing three different-length arrays into one fixed-width record. Reachable
from Python as `ac3.verify.trace_to_csv`/`trace_to_json_lines`; from there,
`pandas.read_csv`/`read_json(lines=True)` followed by `.to_parquet()` is how Parquet is reached —
this library does not carry its own Parquet writer for one research-only export path.

### Other

| Component | What it is |
|---|---|
| `iclforge::ac3::io::scan` | Finds access-unit boundaries in a raw elementary stream and reports what it renders, without being told — grouped by programme, so a stream with two independent substreams describes both rather than one at twice the frame rate. `iclforge::ac3::io::read_frame_header` is the same per-syncframe walk exposed on its own. |
| `iclforge::ac3::io::probe` | The stream description above (`forge probe`), as a human table or a versioned JSON contract. |
| `iclforge::ac4`, the inspector | An AC-4 (ETSI TS 103 190-1/-2) sync-frame/TOC/presentation/substream-group bitstream inspector — channel-coded, A-JOC-coded, direct-coded-object and OAMD substream groups alike — the same probe/JSON contract extended to a second codec (`forge probe` auto-detects it). It splits sync frames from a whole buffer or from a stream that arrives in pieces (`SyncFrameSplitter`), and gives the frame rate, the `dac4` box describing every presentation (or what it cannot describe), the rule of Annex H.1.2.1 a stream breaks for a CMAF track, the RFC 6381 codec string, and the values an HLS playlist and a DASH manifest state of a track. Audio content it reports by byte range, for `iclforge::ac4` to decode. Installed and exported. An A-JOC substream's `oamd_common_data()` is parsed with the TOC; an OAMD substream's payload, which can carry a second `oamd_common_data()`, is reported by byte range like audio content. Links nothing from `iclforge::ac3` and knows nothing about AC-3 — a peer codec, not an extension. See [Validation](../verification.md#ac-4). |
| `iclforge::ac4`, the decoder | An AC-4 decoder (`libs/ac4/src/decoder`, `iclforge::ac4::Decoder`), written from ETSI TS 103 190-1 and -2 with a second transcription of the syntax in Python: channel-coded substreams from mono to 7.1 in the SIMPLE, ASPX and A-CPL codec modes at every frame rate, with the output level, DRC, dialogue enhancement, the downmix and concealment, streams of several presentations, the presentation chosen as Part 2 4.8.2 has it and its substreams mixed, the immersive elements of 7.0.4, 7.1.4, 9.0.4 and 9.1.4 in every immersive codec mode, in full or core decoding, rendered to the layout asked for by Part 2's channel renderer, the 22.2 element in full decoding as coded (24 channels, checked on constructed streams alone) and the 9.X.4 modes (13 or 14 channels in Table A.27's order, the screen pair folded by Tables 38 to 43's 9.X rows, checked on constructed streams alone), and object audio: A-JOC substreams in full and core decoding and direct-coded objects, each object handed over with its PCM and the Annex F properties its metadata sets for the application to render, and the intermediate spatial format rendered by Part 2's ISF renderer. It reports each presentation and the metadata of the one decoded, and hands its output over a frame or 256 samples at a time. Core decoding and any layout but as coded of a 22.2 source are refused. A SIMPLE-mode substream with an HSF extension decodes at 96 or 192 kHz, with the output level and the downmix (from the text alone: no stream here uses it); A-SPX, A-CPL, the speech spectral frontend, the immersive and 22.2 elements, objects, mixing, dialogue enhancement and DRC's compression are refused at those rates. It builds at `ICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR=float` for a part with a floating-point unit, and in the minimum-footprint decode profile without exceptions; the float decode agrees with the double one to 109 dB or better below A-SPX's crossover and 37 dB or better above it, on every committed stream (`testdata/ac4/scalar-agreement.json` pins floors 3 dB under those figures). Installed and exported with `iclforge::ac4`; see [AC-4](ac4.md) and [Validation](../verification.md#ac-4). `forge-gui`'s QC, stream player and object page read AC-4 through it, with a presentation of the stream's choosing on the first two ([QC](../forge/gui/qc.md#ac-4)), and Hearth's engine plays it. On the ESP32-P4 it builds in the minimum-footprint profile in single precision, behind `CONFIG_ICLFORGE_AC4`, and plays channel-based AC-4 in `hearth_sink`: 2.0 in SIMPLE and A-SPX modes in real time, wider layouts slower than that ([ESP32-P4](../platforms/bare-metal/esp32-p4.md#ac-4)). |
| `iclforge::ac4`, the encoder | An AC-4 encoder (`libs/ac4/src/encoder`, `iclforge::ac4::Encoder`), written from the same two standards: mono, stereo, 5.0 and 5.1, and 5.0.4 and 5.1.4 in the immersive element (7.0, 7.1, 7.0.4, 7.1.4 and a 3.0 dialogue substream experimental), in the SIMPLE, ASPX and A-CPL codec modes and, in the immersive layouts, S-CPL and A-SPX with S-CPL, at 48 kHz at every frame rate or at 44.1 kHz, at a constant, average or variable rate, with I-frames where a container needs them, the loudness, DRC, downmix and dialogue enhancement metadata, and several substreams and the presentations of Part 2 Table 53 made of them. Behind `experimental.objects` it codes objects with their Annex F metadata over time, as an A-JOC substream over a computed downmix or a static 5.0 or 5.1 bed, or as direct-coded object substreams ([encoding objects](ac4.md#encoding-objects)). `Encoder::refusal_reason()` names the rule a configuration it refuses breaks; each frame comes out as an MP4 sample, and `sync_frame()` wraps it for a raw file or MPEG-2 TS. Installed and exported with `iclforge::ac4`; see [AC-4](ac4.md#encoding-a-stream) and [Validation](../verification.md#the-encoder). `forge-gui`'s AC-4 tab encodes one source through it and echoes the `forge ac4-encode` line that writes the same bytes ([Format and channels](../forge/gui/format-and-channels.md#ac-4)), and its Objects tab writes AC-4 objects the same way. |
| `iclforge::containers::matroska` | A standalone MKV muxer. Links nothing from `iclforge::ac3` and knows nothing about AC-3. Matroska registers no codec ID for AC-4, so it carries none. |
| `iclforge::containers::mp4` | A standalone MP4/ISOBMFF muxer, same shape as `iclforge::containers::matroska`. `iclforge::ac3::io::build_codec_config_box` builds a spec-correct `dac3`/`dec3` sample-entry box (ETSI TS 102 366 Annex F), Dolby Atmos extension included, straight off the bitstream, and `iclforge::ac4::build_dac4()` the AC-4 `dac4` box from a stream's table of contents. |
| `iclforge::containers::mpegts` | A standalone MPEG-2 Transport Stream muxer (PAT + PMT + one PES-wrapped elementary stream — see [Out of scope](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#out-of-scope) for the multi-service multiplex this deliberately does not build), identifying AC-3/E-AC-3 per either broadcast profile: DVB's ETSI EN 300 468 Annex D descriptors, or ATSC's `stream_type` 0x81/0x87 with A/52 Annex A and Annex G's own, and AC-4 under DVB's extension descriptor (ATSC never registered AC-4 for MPEG-2 TS, and the muxer refuses the pair). Both descriptors' identification fields are filled in from what `iclforge::ac3::io::scan` reads off the bitstream, `mainid`/`asvc` from the operator (`forge ts ... mainid=3`, `asvc=0,2`) and checked against the stream's own `bsmod` for consistency. `iclforge::containers::mpegts::parse_service_descriptor` (`iclforge::containers::mpegts::demux`/`Reader`'s own `ReadStream::service`) is the read side: a real transport stream's PMT descriptor decodes back into the same field values, not just the codec identification alone. Links nothing from `iclforge::ac3` beyond the A/52 field values it is handed. |
| `iclforge::ac3::io::strip_objects` | Removes the JOC/OAMD object layer from a Dolby Digital Plus stream at the bitstream level — no decode, no re-encode, bit-identical bed audio — turning a DD+ JOC stream into the plain DD+ 5.1 rendition HLS delivery wants beside it. `forge strip-objects`. |
| `iclforge::iab` | A standalone reader for SMPTE ST 2098-2's Immersive Audio Bitstream (IAB) — the format Dolby Atmos cinema masters carry, and that Netflix's IMF pipeline delivers inside MXF track files (SMPTE ST 2067-201). Reads a bare elementary `.iab` file or a real MXF Track File alike, decodes its lossless `AudioDataDLC` essence (Annex B, 48 and 96 kHz), and writes elementary IABitstreams, including DLC encoding, and IMF IAB Track Files (ST 2067-201). Links nothing from `iclforge::ac3` and knows nothing about AC-3 — on by default, no third-party dependency. See [IAB reading](iab.md). |
| `iclforge::adm` | A standalone BW64/RF64 + Audio Definition Model reader (container and metadata parsing only — codec-blind by design). Parses the container (ITU-R BS.2088-1) and the ADM XML graph (ITU-R BS.2076-2) on top of the vendored libbw64/libadm (github.com/ebu); links nothing from `iclforge::ac3` and knows nothing about AC-3. `iclforge::adm` maps its object/bed graph, with size, channel lock and TS 103 420 Annex B zone constraints, onto `iclforge::ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder`'s input shape, driven end to end by `forge atmos-adm`, and lists what it cannot carry per channel — see [ADM bridging](adm-bridge.md). Opt-in (`-DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON`, needs Boost) — the one component in this project with a third-party dependency. |
| `iclforge::containers::iamf` | A standalone reader and writer for AOM's IAMF (Immersive Audio Model and Formats) v2.0.0 — codec-blind, same shape as `iclforge::containers::mp4`/`iclforge::containers::matroska`. Writes `ipcm` channel-based Audio Elements (`mux()`: 7.1.4ch) and object-based ones (`mux_objects()`, with Parameter Block OBUs animating positions), with trimming, Temporal Delimiters and the Mix Presentation's loudness, as an ISO-BMFF file, a raw OBU stream or movie fragments (`FragmentedWriter`), and reads all three back, down to the `ipcm` samples. E-AC-3 can never be an IAMF codec, so the channel-based route is a decode → rewrap bridge — see [IAMF](iamf.md) and `examples/mux_iamf.cpp` for the `Eac3Decoder` round trip. It does not encode Opus, AAC-LC or FLAC, and does not render. |
| `iclforge::containers::mp4::fragment` + `iclforge/containers/mp4/hls.hpp` + `iclforge/containers/mp4/dash.hpp` | Fragmented MP4/CMAF segmenting (init segment + media segments, ISO/IEC 14496-12 §8.8 / ISO/IEC 23000-19) plus HLS media/master playlist and DASH `AdaptationSet` signaling helpers for the same segments — correct `CODECS`/`codecs` (RFC 6381) and, for Dolby Atmos, HLS's `CHANNELS="<N>/JOC"` (Apple's HLS Authoring Specification), with a multi-rendition master playlist for the paired 5.1 fallback that specification asks for. AC-4 tracks fragment by TS 103 190-2 Annex H, each fragment starting at an I-frame, with the `ca4m`/`ca4s` brands and Annex G's DASH descriptors. `forge fmp4` wraps the whole thing. |
| `iclforge::containers::iec61937` | S/PDIF burst packing: AC-3 byte-exact against FFmpeg's `spdif` muxer; E-AC-3 (`Eac3BurstPacker`) verified against FFmpeg's `spdif_header_eac3` and Microsoft's own IEC 61937 documentation (both independently fetched, not recalled — see the caveats below). AC-4 (`Ac4BurstPacker`) in IEC 61937-14's four burst types, written from the standard, its repetition periods and burst sequences checked in `iclforge-containers-tests` against a second transcription of its tables; no device here accepts AC-4, so none has received it. |
| `iclforge::audio` | Live input/loopback capture — WASAPI on Windows, ALSA or PipeWire on Linux, CoreAudio on macOS (input only, no loopback) — through a lock-free SPSC ring. |
| `iclforge::audio::PassthroughSink` | Exclusive-mode/direct bitstream output, AC-3 or E-AC-3 — WASAPI on Windows, ALSA or PipeWire on Linux, CoreAudio on macOS, JNI-bridged `AudioTrack` on Android. AC-4 on ALSA and Android, whose APIs take IEC 61937 bursts as opaque two-channel data; WASAPI, PipeWire and CoreAudio name the codec, have no AC-4 to name, and refuse it with `kUnsupportedFormat`. See the caveats below (Windows, Android and Raspberry Pi hardware-confirmed; the CoreAudio backend is not, and PipeWire's negotiation needs a compressed codec enabled on the target node — see [Linux audio](../building.md#linux-audio)). |
| `iclforge::audio::MonitorSink` | Shared-mode PCM playback — WASAPI, ALSA, PipeWire, CoreAudio or AAudio on Android: a non-bitstreamed preview/monitor path that decodes what is being encoded and plays it back on an ordinary output. Confirmed against real Windows hardware. |
| `iclforge::audio::LivePositionSource` | A live object-position source over OSC 1.0/UDP, draining into `iclforge::objects::oba::SceneCursor` once per encode frame — for `forge live mode=atmos positions=osc:<port>` and the GUI live room's "Drive objects from OSC" toggle, replacing the built-in synthetic orbit for whichever objects it drives. Binds loopback (`127.0.0.1`) unless the operator opts into `osc:any:<port>` (CLI) or the "any interface" checkbox (GUI). `osc` is the only implemented `positions=` scheme — the grammar is scheme-prefixed so MIDI and a game controller could land later without a grammar change, but neither exists yet. This project's first network-facing parser; see [Threat model](../threat-model.md#trust-boundary). |
| `iclforge::ac3::analysis` | Peak/RMS metering with console ballistics, and the Gerzon energy vector over the BS.775 ring. |
| `iclforge::ac3::meta::qc` | Bitstream-aware loudness QC (`forge qc`): decodes a stream, measures it with the real BS.1770-4/EBU Tech 3342 meter, and compares against the stream's own embedded `dialnorm`/`compr` and, optionally, a named delivery-spec gate — EBU R 128 s2, ATSC A/85, or Netflix's Sound Mix Specifications, each preset's target/tolerance/true-peak ceiling cited from its own primary source. |

## What it does not do

The full picture — verification gaps, quality numbers, and exactly what has and has not been
confirmed against real hardware — is [Validation](../verification.md), not here. Three gaps are
load-bearing enough to flag up front:

!!! warning "Objects will not decode as objects in Dolby's decoder"
    DD+ JOC gates object decoding on a keyed, sequence-bound HMAC-SHA-256 tag in the EMDF
    `protection` field — which the standard itself leaves "implementation dependent and not
    defined" — keyed on a secret embedded in decoder binaries. Streams from here are
    spec-correct (FFmpeg validates them, the bed decodes bit-exactly, Dolby's own parser reports
    `atmos=true`) but this project ships no key, so by default they are unsigned and Dolby's
    decoder falls back to the 5.1 bed; an operator who has a key can sign with it — see
    [Object signing](signing.md). The gate is authenticity, not conformance. Forging
    the tag is deliberately not attempted. What is verified about reconstruction is the
    mathematics: §6.6.6 applied per band recovers each object to better than −20 dB.

!!! warning "Linux audio output has reached a real receiver on one machine only"
    The ALSA backend was verified headless (including against ALSA's software `null` device,
    under ASan+UBSan), and has since bitstreamed to a real receiver for real on exactly one
    machine: a Raspberry Pi 4B driving an Atmos-capable AVR over HDMI, everything from plain AC-3
    through signed Atmos/JOC locking correctly (see
    [Raspberry Pi](../platforms/raspberry-pi.md#live-hdmi-passthrough-to-a-real-receiver), which is
    also where the vc4-hdmi device-classifier bug that run found is written up). The **PipeWire**
    backend reached the same receiver on 2026-09-05, on the same Pi: a pre-encoded 5.1 fixture
    that the receiver's front panel read as "5.1 DD+", and Crucible's own live engine with a
    placed object, read as "Atmos/DD+" at 7.1 — see
    [the promotion record](../crucible/design/promotion.md). PipeWire needs a compressed codec enabled
    on the target node by the session manager first, which WirePlumber filled there from the
    receiver's EDID. No other Linux machine, sound card or receiver has been tried: treat this as
    two confirmed configurations on one box, not as Linux generally.

!!! warning "AC-4 objects have no second decoder, and no receiver has taken AC-4"
    The decoder refuses core decoding and any layout but as coded of a 22.2 source, and, at 96 or
    192 kHz, everything but the SIMPLE codec mode with the output level and the downmix. It decodes
    the speech spectral frontend, the efficient high frame rate mode, the 9.X.4 modes and 96 and
    192 kHz from the text alone: no stream uses any of them. Object audio has no reference decode to compare with: librempeg
    refuses object coding, and DEE writes no A-JOC from this project's masters, so A-JOC is
    checked against constructed streams and one third-party file, Chromium's `ac4-ajoc.ac4`, which
    is kept out of the tree. The encoder's objects are experimental, and no reader outside the
    project has checked them. AC-4 over IEC 61937 is written from the standard, and no device
    here accepts AC-4, so no receiver has been sent it. Of the microcontrollers, only the
    ESP32-P4 plays AC-4.

Enhanced coupling has no external decode oracle at all — not even the
FFmpeg-can't-but-the-in-repo-decoder-can situation 7.1.4 is in, since FFmpeg's own Annex E parser
has never read its syntax — so `tools/ci/quality_race.py`'s CI gate scores it through this
project's own decoder instead (see [Validation](../verification.md#where-the-oracles-dont-reach)).
Transient pre-noise processing has a partial one: FFmpeg reads its streams but does not apply the
correction, and a Dolby Encoding Engine stream that uses the tool is scored in the gold-reference
gate. Neither tool is in the `auto` tool set: enhanced coupling measures *better* than standard
coupling on real programme material at every bitrate and layout tried and is kept out purely so
`auto` produces streams FFmpeg can read, while transient pre-noise processing measured 6.5–24 dB
worse than leaving the audio alone over exactly the samples it touches, at every bitrate, with no
perceptual movement either way — a reference-correctness tool rather than a quality one.
[Encoding E-AC-3](encoding-eac3.md#what-auto-will-not-choose) carries both measurements, and says
what the second predates. Transient pre-noise processing's 1536-sample decoder hold-back is an API
characteristic, not a gap; [Decoding](decoding.md) covers it. Variable bit rate is E-AC-3 only — AC-3's frame size indexes Table 5.18 rather than
stating a word count directly, so it has no equivalent and stays CBR.
