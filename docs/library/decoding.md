# Decoding

This page covers AC-3 and E-AC-3. AC-4 has a decoder of its own, `iclforge::ac4::Decoder`, with its own
controls, presentations and objects, and none of `iclforge::ac3::io` reads it: see [AC-4](ac4.md).

## Reading a stream: `iclforge::ac3::io::scan`

`iclforge/ac3/io/elementary.hpp`. Finds access-unit boundaries in raw bytes and reports what the stream
carries, without being told. This is what a muxer needs, and deriving it from the bitstream
beats asking a caller who can be wrong.

```cpp
// Spans in the result point into `stream`, so it has to outlive them.
const auto scanned = iclforge::ac3::io::scan(stream);
if (!scanned) {
    fmt::printf("scan failed: %.*s\n",
                static_cast<int>(iclforge::ac3::io::describe(scanned.error()).size()),
                iclforge::ac3::io::describe(scanned.error()).data());
    return 1;
}
fmt::printf("%s, %u Hz, %d channels, %zu access units\n",
            scanned->kind == iclforge::ac3::io::StreamKind::kAc3 ? "AC-3" : "E-AC-3",
            iclforge::ac3::sample_rate_hz(scanned->sample_rate), scanned->channels,
            scanned->access_units.size());
```

`ScannedStream::channels` is what the stream **renders**, which for E-AC-3 folds in every
dependent substream's `chanmap` — it is not the bed's channel count. `access_units` holds one
span per AC-3 syncframe, or per E-AC-3 independent substream together with the dependents
following it.

Both formats put `bsid` at bit 40 deliberately, so a reader can tell them apart before
committing to a layout. `iclforge::ac3::stream_bsid` exposes that on its own.

## A stream that arrives in pieces: `iclforge::ac3::io::AccessUnitAccumulator`

`iclforge/ac3/io/stream_accumulator.hpp`. `scan`, `split_frames` and `split_access_units` take the whole
stream as one span. `AccessUnitAccumulator` applies the same boundary rule incrementally, for an
HTTP body, a file read a block at a time or a flash partition read a page at a time. The caller
owns the storage, appends through `writable()` and `commit()`, and takes each whole access unit
from `next()`; nothing is allocated.

```cpp
std::array<std::byte, iclforge::ac3::io::kRecommendedBuffer> storage;
iclforge::ac3::io::AccessUnitAccumulator accumulator{storage};
for (;;) {
    const auto next = accumulator.next();
    if (next.status == iclforge::ac3::io::AccessUnitAccumulator::Status::kNeedMoreInput) {
        const std::size_t got = read_from_somewhere(accumulator.writable());
        if (got == 0) {
            accumulator.finish();
        } else {
            accumulator.commit(got);
        }
        continue;
    }
    if (next.status != iclforge::ac3::io::AccessUnitAccumulator::Status::kUnit) {
        break;  // kEndOfStream, kBufferTooSmall or kError
    }
    // next.bytes is one access unit, valid until the next call
}
```

A unit ends where the next begins, so `finish()` is what closes the last one. The storage has to
hold the largest access unit and the start of the frame after it: `kMinimumBuffer` (4 160 bytes)
suits a stream whose access units are one syncframe, and `kRecommendedBuffer` (16 384) an
independent substream with three dependents. A buffer that is too small gives `kBufferTooSmall`,
and `error()` says which `ScanError` a `kError` was. `resynchronised_bytes()` counts the bytes
skipped looking for a sync word. `iclforge::ac4::SyncFrameSplitter` is the AC-4 counterpart
([AC-4](ac4.md#the-inspector)).

## Where access unit *i* starts: `iclforge::ac3::io::access_unit_timing`

Same header. `ScannedStream::access_unit_samples` records how many samples each access unit
codes, parallel to `access_units`. That is always 1536 for AC-3 (§5.3.1: six blocks of 256, no
other option), but E-AC-3's `numblkscod` lets an independent substream code 1, 2, 3 or 6 blocks
(§E2.3.1.4), so an E-AC-3 access unit is 256, 512, 768 or 1536 samples long — and a stream may
mix lengths.

```cpp
const auto at = iclforge::ac3::io::access_unit_timing(*scanned, index);
at->start_sample;                     // samples from the start of the stream
at->duration_samples;
at->start_seconds();
at->start_in_timescale(90'000);       // MPEG-2 systems clock
at->duration_in_timescale(90'000);
```

Every value is computed from the **absolute** sample position rather than by summing per-frame
increments. A frame duration is very often not a whole number of ticks in whatever timescale a
container uses (1536 samples at 44.1 kHz is 34.83 ms), so a running sum drifts; computing from
the absolute position keeps the error under one tick however long the stream runs. `duration_in_timescale`
is the difference between this unit's converted start and the next one's, not the duration
converted on its own — otherwise a run of durations would not add up to the start times they
are supposed to.

Three lookups go with it:

| Call | Answers |
|---|---|
| `stream_duration_samples` / `stream_duration_seconds` | How long the whole thing is |
| `access_unit_at_sample` / `access_unit_at_seconds` | Which unit covers a position — i.e. where a frame-aligned cut lands. A position inside a unit names that whole unit; a cut is never a split |
| `uniform_access_unit_samples` | The one length every unit shares, or nothing when they differ |

That last one is exactly the question a fixed-duration container track can answer and a variable
one cannot: `iclforge::containers::mp4::AudioTrack`, `iclforge::containers::mpegts::AudioTrack` and `iclforge::containers::matroska::AudioTrack` each hold a single
`samples_per_frame`, so a stream it returns nothing for cannot be described to them without
per-sample durations they do not model. `forge`'s `mkv`/`mp4`/`fmp4`/`ts` take the figure from
here and refuse such a stream rather than muxing it to a silently wrong timeline.

## Changing metadata without re-encoding: `iclforge::ac3::io::metadata_edit`

`iclforge/ac3/io/metadata_edit.hpp`. `dialnorm`, `compr`, `bsmod` and `dsurmod` are delivery decisions —
what a receiver is told the dialogue level is, how hard to compress on an RF output, what kind of
service this is, whether the surrounds were matrixed. All four live in `bsi`, ahead of the first
`audblk`, and none of them changes a coded coefficient. Re-encoding a programme to correct one
costs a whole generation of lossy coding for nothing.

```cpp
std::vector<std::byte> stream = /* an AC-3 or E-AC-3 elementary stream */;
const auto summary = iclforge::ac3::io::edit_stream_metadata(stream, {.dialnorm = 24, .bsmod = 2});
// summary->syncframes visited, summary->changed actually different afterwards
```

`read_frame_metadata` reports what one syncframe carries — including E-AC-3's whole `mixmdate`
group and AC-3's two `bsi` downmix levels — and which of the rewritable fields it transmits at
all.

**A field the stream does not transmit** (`compr` behind a clear `compre`, `bsmod` and `dsurmod`
behind a clear `infomdate`) is `kFieldAbsent` to `edit_stream_metadata`, which only overwrites.
`insert_stream_metadata` adds it, for E-AC-3:

```cpp
const auto grown = iclforge::ac3::io::insert_stream_metadata(stream, {.compr = 0x40, .bsmod = 2});
// grown->bytes is a new stream; grown->grown syncframes got longer, by grown->added_bytes
```

Putting bits into the front of a syncframe moves every later bit, so the frame gets longer: E-AC-3's
`frmsiz` is a free 11-bit length, and the padding that makes up the last whole 16-bit word is
`auxbits` ahead of an `auxdatae` of zero, which is how the encoder pads. The audio blocks are
copied bit for bit and the frame's CRC is re-stamped, so a decoder produces the same samples; what
changes is each lengthened frame's size, by one or two words. Three things refuse the insert by
name (`kCannotInsert`) rather than guess: block start information (`blkstrtinfo` holds each
block's offset from the frame start, so every one would be wrong), auxiliary data (it is found by
walking back from the tail, and padding must not come between the two), and a substream that is
not independent. AC-3 cannot take it at all: its frame size is a code (`frmsizecod`) that fixes the
bit rate, and room inside it would have to be found by walking all six audio blocks to where the
audio ends. An AC-3 frame lacking the field stays `kFieldAbsent`.

The CRCs are the part that is not obvious. `crc2` is an ordinary trailing CRC. `crc1` is not:
A/52 §7.10.1 puts it **before** the region it protects and requires the register to read zero
once the first 5/8 of the syncframe has been shifted through, so it has to be *solved* rather
than computed — `iclforge::ac3::solve_leading_crc` (`iclforge/ac3/core/crc16.hpp`) does that with a GF(2)
polynomial inverse, and is the same function the encoder itself uses. `restamp_crc` is public
for a caller doing its own bsi surgery (`iclforge::ac3::signing::sign_atmos_frame` is the in-project
precedent) so nobody has to reimplement that solve.

Stated as limits rather than left to be discovered:

- **Only fields already on the wire can change.** `compr` lives behind `compre`, and E-AC-3's
  `bsmod`/`dsurmod` behind `infomdate`; a frame that did not transmit one has no bits to
  overwrite, and inserting them would move every bit after it and re-frame the syncframe — which
  is a re-encode by another name. That is `kFieldAbsent`, and the answer is to encode (or
  transcode) with the field enabled — on this project's own E-AC-3 encoder, that means setting
  `eac3::FrameConfig::info`, which is what writes `infomdate`; a stream encoded with it unset
  carries no `bsmod`/`dsurmod` to rewrite.
- A **dependent** E-AC-3 substream reports no `compr` whatever its `compre` bit says: §E3.8.5
  repurposes that bit to mark the last dependent of the programme. Its eight bits are still
  skipped correctly; they are simply not a `compr` word.
- `strmtyp 2` (a convertible substream, §E2.3.1.1) is refused outright, matching
  `iclforge::ac3::plan::validate`'s own stance.

A field named in an edit that **no** syncframe in the stream carries fails before anything is
written, so the stream is either fully rewritten or left byte-for-byte alone — a metadata option
that silently did nothing is indistinguishable from one that does not work.

`ScannedStream` also carries the raw syntax values a container writer needs but cannot
re-derive: `bsid`, `bsmod` (with `bsmod_present`, since Annex E carries it only inside
`infomdate`), `bit_rate_code`, `dsurmod`, `mix_metadata`, `oba_complexity_index`, and — for
E-AC-3 — `independent_substreams` plus a `SubstreamService` for substreams 1–3. Those feed
`iclforge::ac3::io::build_codec_config_box`'s `dac3`/`dec3` payload and the MPEG-TS PMT descriptors of
both broadcast profiles (see [Muxing & sinks](muxing-and-sinks.md#muxing-iclforgecontainersmpegtsmux)).
`independent_substreams` is an *observation* of which substream ids appear; it deliberately does
not change how `scan` groups access units, which stays one-programme.

## Object-layer strip

`iclforge/ac3/io/object_strip.hpp`. The inverse of the object encoder, at the bitstream level: it takes
the EMDF/JOC object layer out of a Dolby Digital Plus stream without decoding anything.

```cpp
const auto stripped = iclforge::ac3::io::strip_objects(joc_stream);
if (!stripped) {
    // describe(stripped.error()) says why
}
// stripped->bytes is a plain DD+ 5.1 stream; the bed decodes identically.
```

A DD+ JOC stream is an ordinary 5.1 E-AC-3 stream that happens to carry an EMDF container —
OAMD positions plus JOC side information — inside the per-block skip fields the standard already
requires a decoder to step over. The bed underneath is the **full mix**, every object already
panned into it, which is exactly why an Atmos-unaware decoder can play the stream at all. So the
5.1 rendition of a JOC stream does not need re-encoding; it needs the container taken out:

- every exponent and mantissa is copied bit for bit, so the result decodes to sample-identical
  PCM (the tests assert exactly that, and FFmpeg's own decode of both streams agrees);
- the skip fields go entirely, along with TS 103 420 §8.3.1's `addbsi` object-audio marker, so
  nothing downstream — a `dec3` box's Atmos extension, an HLS `CHANNELS="<N>/JOC"` attribute —
  still claims an object layer;
- `frmsiz` is re-derived for the shorter frame, the auxdata padding is re-laid, and `crc2` is
  re-stamped. Unlike an AC-3 syncframe an E-AC-3 one has no `crc1` (Annex E dropped it, leaving
  `syncinfo` as the syncword alone), and `crc2` is the frame's last field covering everything
  before it, so re-stamping is a plain forward recompute.

A rewritten frame is sized to the content it actually holds — §E2.3.1.3 makes `frmsiz` an
arbitrary per-frame word count, unlike AC-3's index into Table 5.18. So the output is smaller
than the input, which is the point for a delivery rendition, but a constant-rate input does not
stay constant-rate: alongside the container, whatever auxdata padding the encoder used to hit
its target rate goes too. A frame with nothing to remove is copied byte for byte.

The container is **removed, not emptied**: an EMDF container with no payloads would still signal
an object layer for a stream that no longer has one, and this project's rule is that a stream
carries objects or omits the container entirely (see [Atmos & JOC](../concepts/atmos-joc.md)).

Frames with no object layer pass through byte for byte — including frames of a bitstream shape
this build cannot rewrite, since a frame with neither the `addbsi` marker nor a skip field has
nothing to strip whatever its shape. A frame that *does* carry an object layer in a shape the
frame walker (`iclforge/ac3/emdf/frame_layout.hpp`) does not map is refused with `kUnsupportedFrame`
rather than passed through, because passing it through would hand back a stream still carrying
the objects this function promises to remove. An AC-3 stream is refused outright
(`kNotEac3`): Annex E is where substreams and skip fields live.

This is the inverse of `iclforge::ac3::signing`'s in-place EMDF rewrite and, like it, needs no key —
taking a container out is not authenticating one. Both share one bit-accurate frame walk
(`iclforge::ac3::emdf::walk_frame`) so the two cannot drift apart.

`forge strip-objects in.ec3 out.ec3` is the command-line front end, and `forge fmp4 …
fallback-51` uses it to write the paired 5.1 HLS rendition Apple's authoring requirements ask
for beside an Atmos one.

## Decoding

`iclforge/ac3/decoder/decoder.hpp`. Two classes, one per generation.

```cpp
// AC-3: one syncframe per access unit. For E-AC-3 use iclforge::ac3::Eac3Decoder and
// decode_access_unit, which applies the §E3.8.2 render across substreams.
iclforge::ac3::FrameDecoder decoder;
for (const auto unit : scanned->access_units) {
    const auto decoded = decoder.decode_frame(unit);
    if (!decoded) {
        fmt::printf("decode failed: %.*s\n",
                    static_cast<int>(iclforge::ac3::describe(decoded.error()).size()),
                    iclforge::ac3::describe(decoded.error()).data());
        return 1;
    }
    samples += decoded->channels.front().size();
}
```

Full program: [`examples/decode_stream.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/decode_stream.cpp).

Both decoders keep overlap-add state, so feed frames in order. `Eac3Decoder` keys its state on
`strmtyp` and `substreamid` together, because a dependent's id lives in its own numbering
space — stepping through syncframes by hand with `decode_substream` gives the same audio as
calling `decode_access_unit`.

`DecodedFrame` reports the metadata separately from applying it, which is the point of the
decoder as a check on the encoder: a test can assert on the `dynrng` words the encoder chose
*and* on the level change they cause, and those are two different claims.

| `DecoderConfig` | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `drc_scale` | 0.0 | §7.7.1 partial compression. 0 ignores `dynrng`; 1 applies it as encoded. A/52 says a consumer decoder should default to applying it — this one defaults to 0 because a reference that silently rescales its output is not a reference. |
| `drc_boost_scale` | none | `std::optional<double>`: the same scaling for boost alone (a `dynrng` word above unity), where it should differ from the cut's. For example, boost 0 keeps quiet passages quiet while `drc_scale` 1 still brings loud ones down. Unset, boost is scaled by `drc_scale` too. Like `drc_scale`, it applies under `OperatingMode::kCustom` only. |
| `fast_imdct` | `true` | The fast inverse MDCT — the same fold the encoder's forward fast path uses — instead of the pseudocode's direct O(N²) sum against a 320 KiB tabulated matrix. Covers every inverse a decode runs: both decoders' PCM reconstruction, the three per-block inverses inside `eac3::ecpl_channel_spectrum`, and `oba::joc::reconstruct`'s per-object synthesis. Decodes 4.5–4.7× faster, agreeing with the direct form to 214.9 dB SNR (AC-3) / 284.7 dB (E-AC-3) over 180 s of stream. It never reaches an encoder — the encoder-internal inverses read `eac3::FrameConfig`'s own `fast_mdct` — so nothing about *encoded* output depends on it. `false` selects the direct reference form, the oracle the fast path's tests validate against; `forge` exposes the pair as `mode=performance` / `mode=reference`. |
| `heavy_compression` | `false` | §7.7.2: prefer `compr` where it exists, falling back on `dynrng` for syncframes that carry none. |
| `output` | all off | The §7.8 output stage — dialnorm, downmix, operating mode. See below. |
| `concealment` | `kNone` | §7.10: what to do with a frame that will not decode. See below. |
| `fast_mdct` | `true` | The §7.9.4 *forward* MDCT fold, for JOC bed analysis under `oba::joc::Domain::kMdctBand` only — the one place a decode runs a forward transform, since §6.6.6's matrix combines the transmitted coefficients against the bed re-expressed in the domain the matrix was estimated in. No effect under the default `kQmf`, whose filterbank has only the one evaluation. `false` selects the direct §8.2.3.2 form, which is `oba::joc::reconstruct`'s own default and what its fast-path tests validate against. |
| `joc_domain` | `oba::joc::Domain::kQmf` | Which domain JOC object reconstruction (above) runs §6.6.6's matrix in: `kQmf` is §7.1's 64-band complex filterbank, what the clause describes and what a licensed decoder runs; `kMdctBand` is the cheaper 512-sample-MDCT approximation this project used before the filterbank existed, correct only against a matrix estimated the same way (`AtmosConfig::joc_domain` on the encode side). The two have different algorithmic delay — `oba::joc::reconstruction_delay(domain)` — so a caller comparing `object_audio` against a known source has to shift by it. |
| `trace` | `nullptr` | AC-3 self-check (`FrameDecoder`): where the decoder records what it derived per block, for `iclforge::ac3::verify` to diff against the encoder's own model. See below. |
| `eac3_trace` | `nullptr` | The E-AC-3 counterpart (`Eac3Decoder`), one whole access unit rather than one frame. See below. |
| `programme` | none | `std::optional<int>` (§E2.3.1.2). Which independent substream's programme `decode_access_unit` renders when a stream carries several — they are alternatives, not layers. `std::nullopt` renders whichever programme each call's access unit belongs to; set to an id and an access unit belonging to any other is skipped without being decoded at all. Ignored by `decode_substream`, which sits below the programme layer. See below. |
| `syntax` | `nullptr` | `FrameSyntax*` (`iclforge/ac3/decoder/syntax_trace.hpp`): which coding tools each block used and what exponent strategy each stream carried, recorded on the way past. Written by **both** decoders, unlike `trace`/`eac3_trace` — the Annex E tools are most of what makes it worth having. Filled incrementally, so a refused frame still leaves behind everything read before the refusal. |
| `skip_reconstruction` | `false` | Parse every field exactly as a full decode does, but stop short of turning the coefficients into audio: no inverse transform, no overlap-add, no JOC object reconstruction, and no per-access-unit channel combination. The metadata (and any trace above) is identical to a full decode's; `channels` and `object_audio` come back empty. What `forge probe` runs a whole file through. Note what it does *not* skip: the mantissas are still read, because the bit position of every field after them depends on it. |
| `skip_object_reconstruction` | `false` | Decode the bed and leave the objects alone: no JOC reconstruction, `object_audio` and `object_indices` come back empty, and everything else (the bed's PCM, `object_metadata`, the trace) is what a full decode gives. Unlike `skip_reconstruction` it still renders audio, the 5.1 downmix the objects were coded against. It exists for memory: the reconstruction state is 147,504 bytes on a 32-bit target, more than the largest contiguous block an ESP32-S3 decode leaves free. |
| `diagnostics`, `diagnostics_context` | `nullptr`, `nullptr` | A plain function pointer and the pointer passed to it, called for the recoverable events the return value does not carry: a CRC that failed, and an EMDF payload id the decoder does not interpret. One branch per occurrence when unset. |

### Block-granular output

Both decoders have three output forms. `decode_frame` / `decode_access_unit` return the PCM in
vectors of their own; `decode_frame_into` / `decode_access_unit_into` write it through spans the
caller owns, a frame per channel; and `decode_frame_by_block` / `decode_access_unit_by_block` hand
it to a `BlockSink` — a non-owning reference to any callable, so passing one allocates nothing —
one `PcmBlock` at a time: `kSamplesPerBlock` (256) samples of every output slot, in the order the
`_into` form writes, delivered once the whole frame or unit has decoded and the output stage has
run. The samples are the `_into` form's exactly, and a downmix arrives as one or two slots. The
spans view the decoder's own storage and are valid only inside the call that hands them over.

```cpp
iclforge::ac3::Eac3Decoder decoder;
const auto sink = [&](const iclforge::ac3::PcmBlock& block) {
    // block.index of block.blocks; block.channels[slot] is 256 samples of
    // the rendered layout's slot. Interleave it into a DMA ring one block deep.
    ring.push(block.channels);
};
for (const auto unit : scanned->access_units) {
    const auto decoded = decoder.decode_access_unit_by_block(unit, sink);
    if (!decoded) { /* as above */ }
}
```

What the form is for is a caller that cannot afford a frame: on an ESP32-S3 a 7.1.4 programme's
frame is 73,728 bytes of the part's free SRAM, and a DMA ring needs a block. For E-AC-3 nothing
is copied on the way out — each slot is a view onto the substream vector that supplies it, a
dependent's over the bed's where §E3.8.2 says it replaces it — so the assembly copy the `_into`
form pays goes as well. AC-3 has no per-substream storage to hand out views of, so its form keeps
one frame of its own (six channels, sized once); the saving there is the caller's. The §3.7
hold-back's `std::nullopt`, a skipped programme and `skip_reconstruction` leave the sink uncalled;
a concealed frame is delivered through it like any other. The
[bare-metal probe](../platforms/bare-metal/cortex-m3.md) decodes every fixture through these forms and holds
no PCM at all.

An access unit's objects come through the same block. `PcmBlock::objects` is a view per JOC
output onto the unit's own reconstruction, cut to the block, and `object_indices` and
`object_metadata` mean what `DecodedAccessUnit`'s do; all three are empty for an AC-3 frame, for
a bed-only decode (`skip_object_reconstruction`) and for a unit with no object layer. A sink
placing objects on loudspeakers therefore needs no frame of anything - the value form's
`object_audio` is a frame of copies per object, and this is none. The probe's
`eac3_atmos_render` row is that sink: `iclforge::spatial::pan_direction` for the gains, once per
object per unit, and a block of float sums per target.

## The output stage

`iclforge/ac3/decoder/output.hpp`. Everything between "the coded channels have been reconstructed" and
"these are the samples a listener hears": dialnorm normalisation, the §7.8 downmix, and §7.7's two
named operating modes. It is off by default — a decoder configured the way the examples above
configure it emits the coded channels untouched, sample for sample — because the decoders exist
first as a check on the encoder, and a stage that silently re-levelled or re-folded their output
would destroy that.

```cpp
iclforge::ac3::FrameDecoder decoder{{
    .output = {.target = iclforge::ac3::DownmixTarget::kLoRo, .mode = iclforge::ac3::OperatingMode::kLine},
}};
// decoded->channels now holds two channels, Lo then Ro, at the -31 dBFS
// reference. acmod/lfe still describe what was CODED.
```

The stage's per-sample arithmetic runs in the decoder's scalar type - `double` in every ordinary
build, `float` under the [minimum-footprint profile](../building.md#minimum-footprint-decoder-profile),
whose targets have a single-precision FPU at best - and its gains and mix coefficients are
`double` everywhere. That profile's probe holds two folded fixtures to their levels on the target.

| `OutputConfig` | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `target` | `kAsCoded` | `kLoRo` (§7.8.1's plain stereo fold), `kLtRt` (§7.8.2's Dolby Surround compatible fold), `kMono` (§7.8's `output_mode == 1/0` branch), or no fold at all. |
| `mode` | `kCustom` | `kLine` (§7.7.1: dialnorm plus the full transmitted `dynrng`) or `kRf` (§7.7.2: `compr` with RF mode's 11 dB, falling back on `dynrng` per §7.7.2.1, plus downmix overload protection — see [RF mode's level](#rf-modes-level)). Both **override** `drc_scale`/`heavy_compression` rather than composing with them — that is what makes them modes rather than two more switches. |
| `apply_dialnorm` | `false` | §5.4.2.8 normalisation onto the −31 dBFS reference. Both named modes imply it, so this only has to be set for `kCustom`. |
| `mix_lfe` | `false` | §7.8 makes the LFE's contribution optional and this decoder drops it by default. |
| `ltrt_phase_shift` | `true` | Whether Lt/Rt's surround sum is really phase shifted 90°, or only polarity-inverted. |
| `rf_ceiling` | `1.0` | What `kRf` holds the fold under, as a linear sample magnitude. |
| `mix_override` | all unset | `MixLevelOverride`: levels to fold with in place of the stream's, one field at a time, in `MixLevels`' fields and units. A set field replaces what the stream carried, or the default that stood in for it. An LFE level is honoured only where the stream allows LFE mixing at all. |

The matrix comes from the **stream's own** mix levels unless `mix_override` replaces them, and
never from constants chosen here. AC-3
carries two coarse levels in bsi (`cmixlev`, `surmixlev`; §5.4.2.4/§5.4.2.5) and E-AC-3 carries a
richer group inside `mixmdate` — separate Lt/Rt and Lo/Ro centre and surround levels plus an LFE
mix level. Both decoders now keep those and report them (`DecodedFrame::cmixlev`/`surmixlev`,
`DecodedSubstream::mixing`), distinguishing "absent" from "present, and says the default";
`iclforge::ac3::mix_levels()` turns either into the coefficients the stage needs, applying §7.8's own
fallbacks where a field is simply not there.

`MixLevels::preferred` passes on `dmixmod`, the fold the content was mixed for (Table D2.2) —
E-AC-3's `mixmdate`, or an Annex D stream's `xbsi1` (see below) — without acting on it: `target` is
always what the caller asked for. A caller that
wants to follow the stream uses `iclforge::ac3::automatic_stereo_target(acmod, preferred)`, A/52 §D3.1.1's
automatic selection: `kLtRt` when the stream prefers Lt/Rt, `kLoRo` for every other code —
`kNotIndicated`, and `kReserved` (Table D2.2's `11`, which A/52:2018 and ETSI TS 102 366 V1.4.1
both leave reserved for AC-3 and E-AC-3 alike, and which §D2.3.1.2 allows a decoder to read as
"not indicated"). `acmod` gates the whole field the same way: Table D2.2's own note leaves
dmixmod's meaning reserved below `3/0` — at `1+1`, `1/0` and `2/0` — whatever code it carries, so
those acmods get `kLoRo` regardless of `preferred`. `forge`'s `downmix=auto` is built on it.

§7.8.1's normalisation — "attenuating all downmix coefficients equally, such that the sum of
coefficients used to create any single output channel never exceeds 1" — means a fold of plain
coefficients can never be louder than the loudest coded sample. That is why there is no soft-clip
anywhere in this path.

The one exception is Lt/Rt *with* its phase shift: a phase shifter preserves energy, not peak, so
that fold can come out louder than its inputs were even though every coefficient is normalised.
That follows from what §7.8.2 asks for rather than from anything decided here —
`ltrt_phase_shift = false` and `kRf` are the two ways to get a bounded output, and the second is
the one that guarantees it.

Lt/Rt's surround sum is phase shifted, through a 127-tap Hilbert transformer, with the
direct path delayed to match; `OutputStage::latency_samples()` reports the resulting 63 samples of
output delay, and is zero for every other configuration. `ltrt_phase_shift = false` selects the
sign-only matrix a lot of hardware implements instead — no latency, at the cost of the surround
sum no longer being in quadrature.

**RF mode's overload protection.** §7.7.2's `compr` guarantees a ceiling for the *mono* downmix,
not for whichever fold was actually asked for, and §7.8.1's normalisation does not cover the LFE
(§7.8 treats its contribution as an addition, at up to +10 dB). `kRf` closes that: a per-frame
gain, ramped across the frame rather than stepped at its boundary so it cannot click, backed by a
clamp so the ceiling is true and not merely likely. `OutputStage::rf_protection_db()` reports the
attenuation currently being held, so a test can assert the limiter engaged rather than only that
the output stayed under the ceiling — which silence also satisfies.

### RF mode's level

A/52 describes what RF mode is for (§7.7.2.1) and how to read `compr` (§5.4.2.10, §7.7.2.2), but
gives no output level for the mode and no offset anywhere; `dialnorm` itself is described only as
the level a reproduction system uses to set its volume (§5.4.2.8, §7.6). The level decoders use
comes from Dolby's own practice: line mode puts dialogue at −31 dBFS and RF mode at −20 dBFS,
11 dB higher.

The 11 dB are the decoder's. `kRf` normalises `dialnorm` onto −31 dBFS as `kLine` does, then
applies each `compr` word with 11 dB on top of the word's own gain (`meta::kRfModeGainDb`). A
syncframe with no `compr` word falls back on `dynrng` and gets no 11 dB, so a stream that carries
no `compr` at all takes the same gains in `kRf` as in `kLine`. `kCustom` with `heavy_compression`
applies the word's §7.7.2 gain alone, which is what FFmpeg's `heavy_compr` does too. For an
E-AC-3 program with dependent substreams the `compr` word is the last dependent's, applied to
every substream of the program (§E3.8.5); an §E2.3.1.2 AC-3 core keeps its own.

All of this was measured against the Dolby Reference Player's decoder (`dlbac3dec`, `drc-mode=rf`
against `drc-mode=line`):

| Stream | Reference Player line / RF | this decoder line / RF |
|---|---|---|
| DEE AC-3 2.0 music, 192 kbit/s, dialnorm 19, `compr` 0xFF | −30.70 / −19.70 LUFS | −30.70 / −19.90 LUFS |
| DEE E-AC-3 2.0 music, 96 kbit/s, dialnorm 19, `compr` 0xFF | −30.70 / −19.70 LUFS | −30.70 / −19.90 LUFS |
| DEE AC-3 5.1, 448 kbit/s, dialnorm 11, `compr` 0xFF | −30.80 / −19.80 LUFS | −30.70 / −20.00 LUFS |
| DEE E-AC-3 5.1, 256 kbit/s, dialnorm 11, `compr` 0xFF | −30.80 / −19.80 LUFS | −30.70 / −20.00 LUFS |

Before RF mode carried the 11 dB this decoder's RF column read −30.90 and −31.00 LUFS. What the
Reference Player showed besides:

- Its RF output is line output plus 11 dB plus the word, in every syncframe that carries one, and
  line output in every syncframe that does not; a stream spliced from the two switched between
  +11.29 dB and 0.00 dB at the splice.
- Dolby's encoder writes its words on that basis. With its RF profile set to `none`, DEE writes
  0xFF (−0.28 dB) for dialogue-level material at dialnorm 31 and at dialnorm 20, and cuts only
  where dialnorm normalisation plus 11 dB would put the mono downmix over full scale — by
  6.6–7.2 dB for clicks peaking at −1.4 dBFS at dialnorm 28. A named RF profile adds its own
  boost and cut around that. `meta::HeavyCompressor` writes its words the same way.
- For a 7.1 stream it applied the last dependent substream's word to all eight channels, as
  §E3.8.5 says, and the independent substream's word when asked for 5.1 or 2.0 output.
- Its arithmetic lands within 0.3 dB of an exact 11 dB, depending on the word: the gains it applies
  fit 2<sup>N</sup>·(1 + f), with N + f the word read as a signed 4.4 number of octaves plus 11/6.
  That is 11.29 dB over line mode for a word of 0x00 and 10.98 dB for 0xFF, where this decoder
  applies 11.00 and 10.72 dB.
- Its `dialnorm` normalisation divides by 2<sup>n/6</sup> for a dialnorm n dB above the
  reference, where this decoder divides by 10<sup>n/20</sup>, the dB A/52 states: −11.04 dB
  against −11.00 dB for dialnorm 20.
- Its Lo/Ro fold in line and RF mode leaves out §7.8.1's normalisation, so for a 3/2 stream with
  −3 dB centre and surround levels it sits 7.66 dB above this decoder's fold in both modes.

**Wide E-AC-3 layouts.** §7.8 defines folds *from* the eight AC-3 acmods and says nothing about
the layouts Annex E's `chanmap` can express: a 7.1.4 programme has no §7.8 fold, because §7.8
predates anything that could code one. `OutputStage`'s layout-aware overload therefore reduces a
rendered Table E2.5 layout to the nearest acmod layout first — each extra location seated where it
obviously belongs (a wide left is a left, a rear surround is a surround, a top front left is a
left), at −3 dB where it shares a seat — and then applies §7.8 proper. That reduction is an
extension beyond the spec and is labelled as one in the source; it is an exact identity for every
plain acmod bed, which is the case that must not change.

Verified against FFmpeg's `-ac 2` decode of the same stream: at 3/2 with `cmixlev` −3 dB and
`surmixlev` −6 dB the two agree to 119–121 dB SNR at zero lag, differing only by a single scalar
of 1/2.20711 — exactly §7.8.1's normalisation divisor for those levels (1 + 0.7071 + 0.5), which
this decoder applies and FFmpeg does not.

**Annex D streams (`bsid` 6).** An AC-3 stream written with Annex D's alternate syntax can carry
an `xbsi1` group: separate Lt/Rt and Lo/Ro centre and surround levels (Tables D2.3–D2.6) and a
preferred stereo downmix, `dmixmod` (Table D2.2). A/52 §D3 makes decoding them optional, and
`FrameDecoder` does. Following §D3.1.2 (ETSI TS 102 366 clause D.2.1.2), the Lt/Rt fold uses
`ltrtcmixlev`/`ltrtsurmixlev`, and the Lo/Ro and mono folds use `lorocmixlev`/`lorosurmixlev`, in
place of bsi's `cmixlev`/`surmixlev`; mono takes the Lo/Ro pair because §7.8.2 defines it as Lo/Ro
summed. A `bsid`-6 stream still carries the two bsi levels, for decoders that do not read `xbsi1`
(§D4.2.1). A stream with no `xbsi1` group, whether `bsid` 8 or `bsid` 6 with `xbsi1e` clear, still
folds with `cmixlev`/`surmixlev`. `MixLevels::preferred` takes `dmixmod` for 3/0 and wider only,
the acmods Table D2.2 defines it for. A surround level Tables D2.4/D2.6 reserve reads as −1.5 dB,
as §D2.3.1.4/§D2.3.1.6 direct, and `DecodedFrame::alternate_bsi` reports it that way. Annex D adds
no LFE mix level, so `mix_lfe` folds the LFE in at §7.8's +10 dB for either `bsid`. A caller
folding a `DecodedFrame` itself gets the same levels from
`iclforge::ac3::mix_levels(acmod, cmixlev, surmixlev, alternate_bsi)`.

Not covered: Annex C's karaoke downmix rules for `bsmod` 7. The mode's `cmixlev`/`surmixlev` are
re-purposed as vocal-channel levels there, so it is a different matrix rather than a variation on
this one, and nothing in this project emits a karaoke stream to check it against.

**A §E2.3.1.2 legacy core inside `Eac3Decoder`.** An AC-3 syncframe (`bsid` <= 8) present in an
E-AC-3 stream is processed as independent substream 0, and its channels become the bed §E3.8.2
assembles a wider programme from. That core has no `mixmdate` to carry — mixing metadata is
Annex E syntax an AC-3 syncframe cannot express — so `apply_output()` folds the ASSEMBLED
programme with exactly the levels described above: the core's own bsi `cmixlev`/`surmixlev`, and
Annex D's `xbsi1` group in place of them where a `bsid`-6 core sent one. `DecodedSubstream` and
`DecodedAccessUnit` carry `bsid` alongside `cmixlev`/`surmixlev`/`alternate_bsi` for exactly this —
`bsid` says which of that trio or `mixing` the fold should read, since a bed only ever populates
one or the other. A dependent's own `mixmdate`, if it sent one, is not consulted either way; only
the bed's ever describes the programme, the same rule a non-legacy-core stream already followed.

The E-AC-3 decoder reads every Annex E coding tool — standard coupling (§E3.3), enhanced coupling
(§E3.5), spectral extension (§E3.6), the adaptive hybrid transform with GAQ (§E3.4), and transient
pre-noise processing (§3.7) — individually or stacked together, at every channel layout including
7.1.4. That includes Annex E's default coupling band structures: a block that transmits no band
structure of its own falls back to Table E2.12 (standard coupling) or Table E2.13 (enhanced
coupling) and decodes normally. Enhanced coupling's `ecplangleintrp` (§3.5.5.3's linear
interpolation between band-centre angles) decodes too — the encoder decides per frame whether it
reconstructs closer to the real content than direct per-band application.

A transient pre-noise correction is counted from the first sample of the frame's PCM as A/52
counts it — block 0's new samples, one block (256 samples) into the frame's decoded output — and
reaches up to 1528 samples back from its transient, which a frame may place in a later frame: up
to 4092 samples past that origin. The Dolby Encoding Engine does exactly that at its lower stereo
and 5.1 rates, putting most of its transients in the next frame; Dolby's own decoder corrects
them on the same origin, which is how the origin was settled (see
`iclforge/ac3/decoder/transient_prenoise.hpp`). This decoder applies each correction once the frame its
transient falls in has decoded, so every reach the syntax can express decodes.

Transient pre-noise processing has one API consequence worth knowing: once a stream turns it on,
`Eac3Decoder::decode_substream` holds 1536 samples back — one frame at six blocks a syncframe, six
at one block — and returns each frame once no correction still to come can reach it, returning
`std::nullopt` while that first 1536 samples builds up. Call `Eac3Decoder::flush()` once at
end-of-stream to collect whatever is still held back; the corrections whose transient the stream
ended before are applied to what did arrive, and an identity holding several short syncframes gets
them back as one substream. A stream that never uses the tool is completely unaffected: every call
returns immediately as before.

`Eac3Decoder::decode_access_unit` builds on the same convention rather than refusing it: an
access unit needs every one of its substreams ready in the same call, and the tool is a
per-substream flag, so one substream turning it on does not have to stall the others. Whichever
substreams already released this call are queued (per substream identity, oldest first) until the
lagging one catches up, so nothing already-decoded is discarded or, worse, silently paired with
the wrong instant in time — a dependent that never uses the tool can keep releasing every call
while an independent that does falls one frame behind, and each call still assembles the correct
pairing once every identity has something waiting. `flush()` drains both caches, one substream per
identity: whatever `decode_substream` itself is still holding, and whatever substream results are
still queued waiting for a sibling.

Block switching (§8.2.2/§7.9) decodes on both, and is reported back: `DecodedFrame::blksw` /
`DecodedSubstream::blksw` gives, per full-bandwidth channel per block, whether that block used the
short transform — the same tier of diagnostic as `dynrng`, exposing what the encoder decided
rather than only applying it.

Dual mono (`acmod` 0, "1+1") decodes on both: it's two independent single-channel programmes
sharing one syncframe rather than a channel layout, so `DecodedFrame`/`DecodedSubstream` carry a
second `dialnorm2`/`compr2` alongside the usual fields, and each channel's §7.7 gain is applied
from its own words — Ch2 is never affected by Ch1's compression or vice versa.
`Eac3Decoder::decode_access_unit`'s `layout` comes back empty for it (`DecodedAccessUnit::acmod ==
kDualMono`), since there's no Table E2.5 location for "the second programme" to render onto — the
two channels come back in coded order (Ch1, Ch2) instead.

The output stage's own §5.4.2.8 normalisation follows the same rule: `OutputStage::apply`'s
optional `dialnorm2` parameter, threaded through from `DecodedFrame`/`DecodedSubstream`/
`DecodedAccessUnit`, levels Ch2 by its own reference under `kLine`/`kRf`/`apply_dialnorm` rather
than by Ch1's `dialnorm` — the two programmes are unrelated, and an encoder sizes Ch2's `compr2`
on the assumption Ch2 is normalised by `dialnorm2`.

Delta bit allocation (§7.2.2.6) is decoded like any other transmitted parameter: both decoders
carry per-channel state across a syncframe's blocks and apply it to the masking curve before
computing `bap`, on the coupling channel as well as the full-bandwidth ones. Both encoders emit
coupling-channel delta (`cpldeltbae`, whenever the coupling channel has segments to send) — E-AC-3
no longer skips it under coupling either. How corrections are chosen, and when they are dropped,
is covered in [Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md#delta-bit-allocation).

Dither substitution (§7.3.4) decodes on both as well: a bin allocated zero bits (`bap` 0)
reconstructs as a true zero when its channel's `dithflag` is clear, and as a dither sample when
it is set. A coupled channel's shared bap-0 bins are dithered independently per *receiving*
channel, after decoupling — §7.3.4's own uncorrelated-noise requirement — never by dithering the
shared coupling-channel coefficient itself. The generator's state persists across frames, like
the overlap-add state, so a long stream's substituted noise does not repeat every syncframe.

`fscod2` (the Annex E half sample rates — 24, 22.05, 16 kHz) is decoded like any other rate: the
reduced rate reuses the same bit-allocation tables as its double-rate parent (§E2.3.1.4), so
nothing else about decoding changes.

## The object layer

An Atmos-in-DD+ stream carries OAMD and JOC payloads in an EMDF container tucked into a block
skip field. `Eac3Decoder` reads it whenever it is there: `DecodedSubstream::object_metadata`
is the decoded programme (`std::nullopt` for plain E-AC-3, and equally for a container that
was found but could not be read — a failure there never fails the surrounding frame, which is
the whole point of EMDF), and `object_audio` is JOC's reconstructed per-object waveforms.

`object_indices` says what each `object_audio` entry *is*: an index into the payload's own
object order (bed channels, then ISF, then dynamic objects), which is what
`oba::joc_object_indices()` computes for the programme. For a dynamic-object-only programme —
what this project's own encoder writes — entry *i* is `object_metadata->objects[i]`; for a bed
programme it names the bed channel instead, which `oba::bed_labels()` turns into a speaker
label. `forge decode <in> <out.wav> <objects_dir>` writes one WAV per entry.

What the parsers read is deliberately much wider than what the encoder writes, because real
streams are wider. On the OAMD side: any number of metadata update blocks at any sample offset
and ramp duration; object size, zone constraints, elevation gating, snap, screen reference,
distance, explicit priority and Table 18's gain-reuse; positions coded differentially against
the previous block; inactive objects; several bed instances, standard or non-standard;
programmes carrying an intermediate spatial format; the `trim_element` and the
`extended_object_element`. An `oa_element` with an id this decoder does not know is skipped by
its own `oa_element_size` and named in `DecodedProgram::skipped_elements`, rather than costing
the payload — which is exactly what that size field is for. On the JOC side: all five of
Table 47's downmix configurations, any clip gain, and per-object band count, quantizer, sparse
mode, interpolation slope and data-point count. The EMDF reader parses the whole of
§H.2.1.3's payload configuration and reports it on `DecodedPayload::config` rather than
insisting on the one shape TS 103 420 Table 56 mandates — real Dolby streams do not restrict
themselves to it even for their own object payloads.

What is still refused, and why each one has to be:

| Refused | Reason |
|---|---|
| `oa_md_version_bits` other than 0 | §5.6.0.1 defines no field layout for another version, so every offset after it would be a guess. |
| `intermediate_spatial_format_idx` 6 or 7 | Table 11b reserves them and gives them no object count, so the bed/ISF/dynamic split cannot be worked out. |
| `joc_dmx_config_idx` 5–7 | Table 48 gives them no channel count, so `joc_data` has no loop bound. |
| `joc_ext_config_idx` ≠ 0 | Table 49 reserves every value and §6.2.1 gives `joc_ext_data()` no syntax and no length — there is nothing to read and nothing to skip. |
| `emdf_version` ≠ 0 | §H.2.2.2 defines the container's fields only for version 0. |
| `protection_length_primary` = `0b00` | Table H.2.5 reserves it, so it names no width to skip. |

`joc_clipgain` (§6.3.3.2) is computed onto `FrameParameters::clip_gain` and applied — correctly:
the published equation reads as ambiguous only through plain text extraction, which drops a "-4"
bias the exponent actually carries; rendering the PDF page as an image (both the 2016 and 2018
editions) shows `1 + (y/32) * 2^(x-4)`, which matches the clause's own stated [1; 8,75] range
exactly at both ends. No clause in TS 103 420 says where in the decode chain the gain belongs, but
that was confirmed empirically (2026-09-22, Dolby Reference Player oracle): it multiplies
reconstructed *object* PCM, never the bed — the player's raw bed output matched this project's own
bed decode at correlation 1.0000 regardless of clip gain, while its object output tracked the
formula's prediction to within ~0.03 dB with the OAR's own limiter disabled. The multiply happens
once in `reconstruct()`'s own dispatcher, on the per-object PCM it gets back from whichever domain
function it calls — every caller already passes `FrameParameters` through unchanged, so one
post-multiply there covers all of them with no duplication.

Separately, and permanently rather than as a gap: Table 47's two "90 degree phase shift" downmix
configurations reconstruct like their unshifted siblings — the shift is a property of how the
downmix was *built*, §6.6.6 says nothing about undoing it before matrixing, and there is no
Hilbert filterbank here to undo it with.

Reconstruction needs the downmix JOC asks for. Table 47's three widest configurations need a
dependent substream's extra channel pair before they can reconstruct at all — `kDmxConfig7X` wants
Lb/Rb, and `kDmxConfig5XPlus2`/`kDmxConfig5XPlus2PhaseShift` want Tfl/Tfr instead — which
`decode_substream` does not have in hand on its own. It parses the payload and defers: once
`decode_access_unit` has unioned every substream's channels into the programme's full layout,
reconstruction runs there instead, in `Domain::kMdctBand` (the QMF pair's own state stays hardcoded
to the five-channel case). Called one substream at a time rather than through `decode_access_unit`,
these three configurations still parse but leave `object_audio` empty; the metadata still decodes
and is still reported either way.

## The mirror self-check

`iclforge/ac3/verify/mirror.hpp` and `iclforge/ac3/verify/eac3_mirror.hpp`. Both decoders can record what they
derived from the wire, so it can be diffed against the encoder's own model of the same frame —
per block, per coded stream, and for E-AC-3 per substream. It exists because a desync is
invisible at the field that causes it: every mantissa's *width* comes out of that model, so the
moment the two sides disagree each goes on reading confidently at its own idea of where it is,
and the failure surfaces some blocks later as whatever §7.10.2 guard the misaligned bits happen
to trip first.

```cpp
// The driver most callers want: a drop-in for eac3::AccessUnitEncoder that also
// decodes every access unit it emits and diffs the two models.
iclforge::ac3::verify::Eac3MirrorEncoder encoder{config};
const auto checked = encoder.encode_access_unit(channels);
if (checked && !checked->ok()) {
    std::puts(encoder.last_report().c_str());
    // "frame 12 substream 1 block 3 channel 1: bap[87] encoder=5 decoder=4"
}
```

`iclforge::ac3::verify::MirrorEncoder` is the AC-3 sibling, over `FrameEncoder`. What each compares is in
its own header; the E-AC-3 side adds what Annex E adds — per-substream and per-block bit offsets
across an independent substream and its dependents, AHT gain mode and per-bin gains, and the
coupling, enhanced-coupling and spectral-extension coordinates. `forge eac3-encode … verify`
is the same check over a whole file.

Both trace pointers are null by default and cost one branch per block when they are: attaching
one never changes what the encoder emits, which is what makes a checked build the same encoder
as the shipped one. The decoder fills its side **incrementally**, so a frame it ends up refusing
still leaves behind everything it read before the refusal — the case the comparison is most
useful in, since the mismatch typically names an earlier block than the refusal does.

Transient pre-noise processing's hold-back (above) is invisible to the check: the trace is
written while a frame is *parsed*, not when its audio is released, so a held-back frame is
compared in the call that decoded it like any other.

## Recovering from a damaged frame

`iclforge::ac3::split_frames` delimits syncframes by sync word and declared size alone — it does not
validate a frame's CRC, so it still finds every boundary correctly even when one frame's payload
is corrupt. That means a caller can decode frame by frame, catch the one bad `decode_frame`
call, and keep going rather than losing the rest of the stream over a single damaged frame — the
shape real capture/transport corruption takes, since a torn or bit-flipped frame does not
usually take its neighbours down with it.

```cpp
const auto frames = iclforge::ac3::split_frames(stream);

iclforge::ac3::FrameDecoder decoder;
int recovered = 0;
int failed = 0;
for (std::size_t i = 0; i < frames->size(); ++i) {
    const auto decoded = decoder.decode_frame((*frames)[i]);
    if (!decoded) {
        const auto message = iclforge::ac3::describe(decoded.error());
        fmt::printf("frame %zu: decode failed (%.*s) - skipping\n", i,
                    static_cast<int>(message.size()), message.data());
        ++failed;
        continue;
    }
    ++recovered;
}
```

Full program: [`examples/decode_robustness.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/decode_robustness.cpp)
— corrupts one frame in the middle of an otherwise-good eight-frame stream and confirms the
other seven still decode.

### Concealing it instead: `DecoderConfig::concealment`

Skipping a frame keeps the *rest* of the stream, but it still leaves a hard discontinuity in the
PCM where that frame should have been. §7.10's answer is to substitute something, and
`DecoderConfig::concealment` opts into it:

```cpp
iclforge::ac3::FrameDecoder decoder{{.concealment = iclforge::ac3::ConcealmentPolicy::kRepeatFade}};
for (const auto unit : scanned->access_units) {
    const auto decoded = decoder.decode_frame(unit);
    if (!decoded) { /* only at the head of a stream - see below */ }
    if (decoded->concealed) {
        ++concealed;  // decoded->concealed->error says what went wrong
    }
}
```

| `ConcealmentPolicy` | What it does |
|---|---|
| `kNone` | Returns the error. The default, and what every caller got before this existed — a decoder used as a verification tool has to report a damaged frame, not paper over it. |
| `kRepeatFade` | Repeats the last good block, decaying about 20 dB across the frame and on into any further consecutive losses. Keeps the programme's texture across a short dropout. |
| `kMute` | Substitutes silence. The last good block's own overlap tail still plays out through the first block, so this fades rather than cuts. |

Both work in the **overlap-add domain** rather than on finished PCM, which is what keeps them
coherent with the frames either side: the decoders retain the last successfully decoded *block's*
windowed transform output and synthesise the concealed frame's blocks from it through the same
overlap-add a real frame goes through. So a concealed frame leaves the delay state in exactly the
shape the next good frame expects — recovery is a normal decode, not a second artefact — and the
fade at each end is the codec's own window rather than a ramp invented for the purpose.

A concealed frame comes back as a **successful** result carrying `DecodedFrame::concealed` (or
`DecodedSubstream::concealed` / `DecodedAccessUnit::concealed`), which is what lets a test assert
on the concealment itself rather than only on "the decode did not fail". Everything else on it
describes the last frame that *did* decode — a damaged frame's own bsi cannot be trusted — and
`dynrng` reads unity throughout, because no word arrived. A concealed E-AC-3 substream never
carries an object layer: OAMD and JOC describe the frame that went missing, and repeating the
previous frame's positions would put moving objects somewhere they demonstrably are not.

One case still returns the error with concealment on: a failure **before any frame has decoded**.
Concealment reconstructs from what came before it, and at the head of a stream there is nothing to
reconstruct from; inventing something there would be substituting audio rather than concealing a
gap in it.

For E-AC-3 there is a third outcome. Assembling an access unit needs every one of its substreams
in the one call, so a damaged *dependent* used to take the whole programme down with it. With
concealment on it does not: the bed is rendered on its own — real channels, just a narrower layout
than the stream promised — and the result reports `ConcealmentAction::kBedOnly`. A damaged
*independent* substream is a different matter, and is concealed (or refused) like any other frame,
because without it there is no programme at all.

`forge decode` and `forge monitor` expose all of this as `conceal=repeat|mute`, and report how
many frames or access units were concealed.

`split_access_units` is the E-AC-3 sibling for `Eac3Decoder::decode_access_unit`, delimiting by
independent-substream boundaries the same way. Losing an entire access unit — every substream of
it, not one substream within it — is still not recoverable here: a transport that can drop whole
units needs its own redundancy or retransmission above this layer. What this API guarantees is
that *finding* the next good boundary never depends on the previous one having decoded cleanly,
and, with concealment on, that a unit missing only some of its substreams still renders.

## Latency, from the decoder's side

The chain's whole budget is on [the AC-3 encoding page](encoding-ac3.md#latency). What matters
here is the part a decoder controls, which is smaller than it looks:

| | Adds |
|---|---|
| `iclforge::ac3::FrameDecoder::latency_samples()` | **0**, always. |
| `iclforge::ac3::Eac3Decoder::latency_samples()` | **0**, or 1536 once §3.7 engages, whatever the syncframe length. |

`FrameDecoder`'s zero is structural rather than lucky: `decode_frame` returns a frame's full
1536 samples per channel from the same call that supplies that frame's bytes. The IMDCT overlap
those samples came out of is real, but it is already charged as the chain's transform term — the
samples the decoder hands back are simply 256 samples *older* than the newest input the encoder
had consumed, not samples it is still waiting for.

`Eac3Decoder`'s exception is transient pre-noise processing. A §3.7 correction reaches across
frame boundaries — back up to 1528 samples from a transient that may lie in a later frame — so the
decoder holds 1536 samples back: at six blocks a syncframe it returns frame N−1 from the call that
supplies frame N, at one block it returns six syncframes late. `decode_substream`/
`decode_access_unit` return `std::nullopt` on the calls where nothing is ready yet, and `flush()`
collects whatever is still pending at end of stream. That is a *release* delay, not a
sample-domain shift — the audio comes out in the same place in the stream, later — so a caller that
honours the `std::nullopt` convention and calls `flush()` gets exactly the same samples in exactly
the same order either way.

`latency_samples()` reports what has actually happened so far, so it reads 0 until some
substream's frame sets `transproce`. To size buffers *before* a stream starts, ask the encoder
(`eac3::eac3_latency`), which knows from its configuration whether the tool will ever be used.

### Atmos objects lag the bed

One number an object-aware receiver needs and would not guess: a JOC-reconstructed object
waveform lags its original input by **832** samples, not 256. JOC does not code objects — it
codes a matrix that pulls them back out of the *decoded bed*, and TS 103 420 §7.1 puts that
reconstruction in a 64-band complex QMF filterbank rather than the MDCT domain — a critically
sampled real transform relies on time-domain alias cancellation between neighbouring blocks, an
assumption a per-frame matrix breaks (see `iclforge/dsp/qmf.hpp`). Analysis plus synthesis costs the
filterbank's own `dsp::kQmfDelay` (576 samples) on top of the bed's 256, for 832 total. The bed
in the same `DecodedAccessUnit` still lags by 256, so **objects and bed are not aligned with each
other** — anything mixing the two has to delay the bed by 576 samples. `oba::AtmosEncoder::latency()`
reports the object path's budget and `bed_latency()` the bed's; the 832 is measured end to end in
[`libs/ac3/tests/decoder/test_latency.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/libs/ac3/tests/decoder/test_latency.cpp).

With `DecoderConfig::joc_domain` set to `kMdctBand`, the reconstruction costs 256 samples rather
than 576, so objects lag their input by 512 and the bed has to be delayed by 256.
`iclforge::render::LayoutRenderer` does this delaying for the one bed channel it plays beside placed
objects, the LFE, once `set_joc_domain()` has told it the decoder's domain;
[`libs/render/tests/test_object_lfe_timing.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/libs/render/tests/test_object_lfe_timing.cpp)
measures the rendered feeds.

## Streams with more than one programme

§E2.3.1.2 allows eight independent substreams (I0–I7) in one elementary stream, and broadcast
DD+ uses them for multi-language and associated services. They are **alternatives, not layers**:
unlike a dependent substream, a second independent one is a complete programme of its own, and a
decoder renders one of them.

That matters to the framing, because the programmes interleave one frame period at a time.
`split_access_units(stream)` delimits but does not select, so on a two-programme stream
consecutive entries are consecutive *programmes*, not consecutive frames — feeding them straight
through would splice two unrelated pieces of audio together.

```cpp
const auto ids = iclforge::ac3::programme_ids(stream);          // e.g. {0, 1}
const auto units = iclforge::ac3::split_access_units(stream, ids->front());
```

`split_access_units(stream, programme)` keeps only that programme's units, and an empty result
means the stream does not carry it — asking is how you find out, so it is not an error.

The decoder can do the selecting instead, which is what a caller already walking every unit
wants:

```cpp
iclforge::ac3::Eac3Decoder decoder{{.programme = 1}};
// A unit belonging to another programme returns std::nullopt, skipped before
// any decoding — no per-substream state advances for a programme you did not
// ask for. (std::nullopt also means the §3.7 hold-back; both call for the
// same thing from a caller: take nothing and go on to the next unit.)
```

Leaving `DecoderConfig::programme` unset renders whatever arrives, which is what every caller got
before the field existed and is right for the single-programme case;
`DecodedAccessUnit::programme` then says which programme each result came from.

`iclforge::ac3::io::scan` reports the same thing for a muxer: `ScannedStream::programmes` describes each
programme's layout, channel count, `bsmod` and access units, and `ScannedStream::access_units`
is the **first** programme's units alone rather than all of them spliced into one track.

## Decoding bytes you do not control

If the stream comes from the network or from a user, read
[Threat model](../threat-model.md) before wiring this up. In short:

- `scan`, `split_frames` and `split_access_units` take the **whole** stream as one span and
  return one span per access unit, so peak memory is O(input) and the library imposes no upper
  bound. Bound the input yourself, drive `decode_frame`/`decode_substream` one unit at a time, or
  feed an `AccessUnitAccumulator`, whose memory is the storage you hand it.
- Every per-access-unit allocation is bounded by a bitstream field of fixed width — a single
  frame cannot be made to consume an unbounded amount of memory or time — and a hostile `frmsiz`
  is refused (`kTruncated` if it overruns the input, `kInvalidStream` if it is shorter than the
  header it was read from) rather than becoming a short span something reads past.
- A refused frame produces no audio, but it is not a rollback: the decoder's overlap-add, dither
  and JOC state have advanced as far as the parse got, and an `_into` form's spans are left
  unspecified. Construct a fresh decoder if you need a clean state after an error.
- The `_into` forms check their span sizes with `assert`, so a release build does not check them
  at all.

## Testing a decoder of your own

The [conformance vector set](../conformance-vectors.md) published with each release is the
inverse of this page: streams this project produces, with the PCM they were encoded from and a
manifest of what each exercises, for checking an independent implementation.
