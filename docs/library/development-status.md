# Development status

At-a-glance implementation status for every codec, coding tool, metadata field, and related
bitstream surface this repository owns — the companion to
[Capabilities and limitations](capabilities.md).

| Page | Role |
|---|---|
| **This page** | Status of each feature: done, partial, or not started |
| [Capabilities](capabilities.md) | What each shipped feature does, with the spec sections and the limitations that shape use |
| [Validation](../verification.md) | How claims are checked, and where external oracles do not reach |
| [Roadmap](../roadmap.md) | Candidate work and history behind stable IDs (`IM5`, `AP10`, …) |
| [Application coverage](application-coverage.md) | Which applications expose each broad library capability |

[CONTRIBUTING.md](../contributing.md) still makes [Capabilities](capabilities.md) and
[Validation](../verification.md) the authority when a capability lands or a limitation is found.
Update those first; refresh the matching row here so the status table stays a summary rather than
a second capability record.

**Legend:** 🟢 Completed • 🟡 Partial / in progress • 🔴 Not started / refused / out of scope

Statuses describe the *bitstream and API surface*, not application polish. A green row can still
carry a note about an oracle gap, an intentional `auto` exclusion, or an interoperability caveat —
those details live in [Capabilities](capabilities.md) and [Validation](../verification.md).

The tables below were cross-checked against the cited standards (A/52 / TS 102 366 including
Annexes D–H and F, TS 103 420, TS 103 190-1/-2, ST 2098-2, BS.2076 / BS.2088, IAMF v2.0.0, and
the carriage specs wired in-tree). Open gaps against those texts are collected again under
[Standards cross-check](#standards-cross-check).

| | Enhanced coupling (§E3.5) | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Enc/dec complete; kept out of `auto` (FFmpeg cannot read); no external oracle |
| | Transient pre-noise (§3.7) | 🟢 | Low | Optional | Enc/dec complete, every reach the syntax allows; DEE stream in the gold gate; kept out of `auto` (measured loss); 1536-sample hold-back; last AU can be lost at EOF |

## Atmos / JOC / OAMD / EMDF (TS 103 420)

| Category | Feature | Status | Priority | Criticality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **EMDF** | Container parse / write (Annex H) | 🟢 | High | Essential | Skip-field placement verified vs DEE |
| | Reserved / unsupported EMDF variants (§H.2.2) | 🔴 | Low | Optional | e.g. `protection_length_primary` = 00, `emdf_version` ≠ 0 — refused rather than guessed |
| **OAMD** | Payload encode (project subset) | 🟢 | High | Essential | `AtmosEncoder` |
| | Payload parse (broader than encode) | 🟡 | Medium | Important | The parser reads most of §5.5: several update blocks, inactive objects, several bed instances, ISF programs, the `trim_element`. The encoder writes one bed or dynamic objects, with `b_object_not_active`, a real `sample_offset_code` and multi-block updates since #801; it writes no ISF programs, extra bed instances or `trim_element` |
| | Channel-based immersive (OAMD bed, no dynamic objects) | 🟡 | Medium | Optional | `AtmosEncoder`'s `BedProgram` constructor and `forge atmos-cbi` encode 5.1.4, 7.1.4 and 9.1.6 beds; only 5.1.4's channel order is checked against a DEE stream |
| **JOC** | Matrix encode (5.X downmix) | 🟢 | High | Essential | 7.X configs decode-only |
| | Object reconstruction (QMF + MDCT, §6.6.6) | 🟢 | High | Essential | Default QMF domain; self-check > −20 dB |
| | `joc_clipgain` application (§6.3.3.2) | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Applied to the reconstructed object PCM, once, in `reconstruct()`, never to the bed; where it applies was confirmed against the Dolby Reference Player (2026-09-22) |
| | Phase-shift downmix undo (`phsflg`, Table 47 configs 2/4) | 🟡 | Low | Optional | Configs parse; reconstructed like unshifted siblings (no Hilbert undo) |
| | 7.X downmix needing dependent Lb/Rb | 🟡 | Medium | Important | Metadata/JOC parse; `object_audio` empty when bed lacks the dependent |
| **Atmos encode** | Bed + objects in E-AC-3 | 🟢 | High | Essential | `oba::AtmosEncoder` |
| | Object size / spread / zone constraints (wire) | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Transmitted in OAMD |
| | Extent / spread / zone / snap in renderer | 🟡 | Low | Optional | Spec leaves behaviour to the renderer; VBAP bed pan does not apply them |
| | Complexity index / addbsi marker (§8.3) | 🟢 | High | Essential | Probe, `dec3`, HLS `CHANNELS="…/JOC"` |
| | Scene timeline (`ObjectScene`) | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Shared by CLI / GUI / live |
| | Live OSC object positions | 🟢 | Low | Optional | Scheme-prefixed; OSC only today |
| **Signing** | EMDF protection HMAC | 🟡 | High | Essential | Mechanism ships; no project key — unsigned streams fall back to 5.1 in Dolby decoders |
| | Authenticity-tag detect / verify | 🟢 | High | Essential | Probe and `signing::verify_*` (single key) |
| | Unchecked object decode (default) | 🟢 | High | Essential | Reconstruct without MAC check — FOSS-style |
| | Multi-key verify (keyring) | 🔴 | Medium | Important | Roadmap Partial / Proposed — [Object signing](../concepts/object-signing.md#planned-decode-modes) |
| | Licensed soft-gate (bed on fail) | 🔴 | Medium | Important | AVR-like: mismatch → bed-only; decode continues |
| **Tools** | Strip object layer (bitstream) | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Bit-identical bed; no re-encode |
| | Object unlock in Dolby decoder | 🟡 | High | Essential | Spec-correct streams; proprietary key gate — see [Object signing](signing.md) |

## AC-4 (ETSI TS 103 190-1 / -2)

| Category | Feature | Status | Priority | Criticality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Inspector (`iclforge::ac4`)** | Sync frame + Annex G CRC | 🟢 | High | Essential | vs DEE fixtures |
| | Sync frames from a stream in pieces | 🟢 | High | Essential | `SyncFrameSplitter`: the caller's storage, no allocation, a partial frame held between reads; resynchronises past bytes that are not a frame and hands a frame found that way over only once a sync word follows it; the frames `scan` finds on committed streams fed in pieces from 1 byte to 64 KiB, and against `scan` in `fuzz_ac4_parse` |
| | TOC / presentations v0–v2 | 🟢 | High | Essential | Channel-based immersive through 7.1.4 |
| | `bitstream_version` 0/1 legacy TOC | 🟡🔵 | Low | Optional | Transcribed; no real DEE stream exercises it (all observed v2); version 0 presentations of several substreams decode and mix on the test multiplexer's streams. Accepted: no stream of version 0 or 1 exists outside the project's own multiplexer, and librempeg refuses version 1, so the text and the two transcriptions are all that check it |
| | Channel-coded substream groups | 🟢 | High | Essential | Probe / JSON contract |
| | A-JOC / object / OAMD substream info | 🟡🔵 | Medium | Important | Parsed; read on constructed streams and on Chromium's A-JOC file, which is kept out of the tree. Accepted: that file is the one stream from another encoder that sets it, and no second reader exists (librempeg refuses object coding; DEE writes no A-JOC from this project's masters) |
| | `oamd_common_data()` (TOC level, §6.2.8.1) | 🟡🔵 | Medium | Optional | Transcribed twice; Chromium's A-JOC file, which sets it in every frame, reads to the end of every substream in both. Accepted: that file is the one stream from another encoder that sets it, so the text and the two transcriptions are what check the rest |
| | OAMD substream DATA body (`oamd_substream()`) | 🔴🔵 | Medium | Important | The inspector leaves it a byte range, by design; `iclforge::ac4` parses it (the Object audio row below). Accepted: the inspector stays a reader of headers and byte ranges, and a second parser of the body would only repeat the decoder's |
| | EMDF-only presentations (config 6) | 🟢 | Low | Optional | Synthetic + dual transcription |
| | `dac4` / RFC 6381 codec string | 🟢 | Medium | Important | MP4 / TS / HLS / DASH wiring |
| | Audio PCM decode (inspector) | 🔴🔵 | High | Essential | By design — content is byte ranges only; see **Decoder** below for `iclforge::ac4` PCM output. Accepted: the decoder is the PCM path, and the inspector links none of it |
| **Decoder (`iclforge::ac4`)** | Presentation + channel-coded syntax | 🟢 | High | Essential | Every syntax element of the presentation substream, the channel elements and the EMDF substreams, in two transcriptions (C++ and `tools/references/ac4_syntax.py`) whose traces agree record for record on every committed stream, in CI |
| | ASF / ASPX / A-CPL / metadata() | 🟢 | High | Essential | DEE's digests pinned in CI; the same dual transcription against Python |
| | Channel-coded paths without fixtures | 🟡🔵 | Medium | Optional | Noise fill, VARVAR ASPX, time-interleaved ASPX, the mono element, alt presentations, transmitted DRC gains — transcribed, oracle-poor; 3.0, 7.X and every A-CPL mode read on constructed streams. The noise fill's band levels, escape and draw order are held to Pseudocodes 22 and 23 on a hand-built track; no stream sets `b_snf_data_exists`, so no reference decode exists. Accepted: no stream from an encoder outside the project sets these tools and no second decoder reads them, so the text and the two transcriptions (`libs/ac4/ERRATA.md`) are what check the readings. Channel-dependent DRC gains for a 3.0 element stay refused: Tables 168 and 69 give it no `nr_drc_channels` |
| | EMDF payload substreams | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Read, and each payload's id and bytes handed to the caller in the substream's report (`SubstreamReport::emdf_payloads`), from an EMDF payloads substream and from an audio substream's `metadata()`; the decoder does not interpret a payload |
| | Dialogue enhancement PCM apply | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Part 1 5.7.8's four methods in the QMF domain, from 0 dB to the stream's cap; 0 dB is the tool bypassed, sample for sample, and the parsed gains apply to 0.01 dB; the channel-independent method on DEE's streams, the others on constructed data; the hybrid methods take their waveform from the presentation's dialogue enhancement substream; `forge decode dialogue-enhancement=` |
| | Elementary stream multiplexing (`b_multi_pid`) | 🔴🔵 | Low | Optional | Part 2 5.1.2: a presentation split over several elementary streams. The decoder takes one, and a presentation whose substream groups another stream holds is not decodable, so it is not selected (`presentation_v1_info()`'s `b_multi_pid`, read by the inspector). Accepted: the standard leaves how matching presentations are identified across streams to system level signalling (NOTE 1 of 5.1.2), so there is no rule in the text to implement |
| | Advanced dialogue enhancement compressor, `max_ducking_depth` | 🔴🔵 | Low | Optional | Part 2 6.2.2.5 and 6.3.3.1.9 to 6.3.3.1.17h: read in the presentation substream (the compressor's time constants, ratio, threshold and gain; Table 68's ducking depth) and not applied. Accepted: the standard gives their values and no processing for either, and Part 1 does not mention them, so there is no algorithm to implement from the text |
| | Speech spectral frontend (SSF) | 🟡🔵 | Low | Nice-to-have | Part 1 4.2.9 and 5.2 in the mono, stereo and A-CPL stereo elements, SIMPLE or ASPX, long and short stride, the predictor and the arithmetic decoder, with Annex C's tables generated from the attachment. Decoded from the text alone, in two transcriptions that agree on random streams (the bits each frame takes, every stride, and every line to 1e-9); the text's defects and the readings taken for them are in `libs/ac4/ERRATA.md`. No stream uses the tool, so no real stream and no other decoder has checked a reading, and PCM from one is unverified; the encoder does not write it. Accepted: no stream outside the project uses the tool and no second decoder exists, so the text and the two transcriptions are all that check a reading |
| | Immersive channel element (7.0.4, 7.1.4) | 🟢 | High | Essential | Part 2 6.2.4 to 6.2.6 in both transcriptions; SCPL, ASPX_SCPL, ASPX_ACPL_1, ASPX_ACPL_2 and ASPX_AJCC: 5.2's track assignment, S-CPL, A-SPX's pairing and gains, A-CPL's four modules and A-JCC, in full and core decoding (`iclforge::ac4::DecoderConfig::decoding`); DEE's 5.1.4 in its three modes with each tone on its own channel, the rest on constructed streams; `forge decode decoding=` |
| | 22.2 channel element | 🟡🔵 | Low | Nice-to-have | Part 2 6.2.4.3 in both transcriptions and decoded in full decoding, SIMPLE and ASPX, to 24 channels in Table A.27's order (Table 21's tracks, eleven pairs' stereo processing, A-SPX over the pairs of Table 8, DRC by Table 69), as coded only: core decoding and every other `DownmixTarget` are refused `kUnsupported`. No stream of it and no other decoder exist: constructed streams with a tone on each channel, read by both transcriptions, and the standard's tables are all that check it. Accepted: what is refused is where Part 2 stops (Tables 35 to 43 have no 22.2 input and Table 8 lists the element for full decoding alone), so core decoding and a render to any other layout stay refused by name; Hearth refuses a 22.2 presentation, whose bottom channels A/52 Table E2.5 has no location for |
| | 9.X.4 channel elements | 🟡🔵 | Low | Nice-to-have | Part 2 6.2.4.1 with `b_5fronts` in both transcriptions; SCPL, ASPX_SCPL, ASPX_ACPL_1, ASPX_ACPL_2 and ASPX_AJCC in full and core decoding: 13 tracks with Table 20's six parameters, S-CPL, A-SPX over (L, Lscr) and (R, Rscr), six A-CPL modules, A-JCC's four modules (two in core); Table A.27's order, rendered to 7.X.4 and 5.X by Tables 38 to 43's 9.X rows (no 9.X layout is a target); dialogue enhancement on Lscr, Rscr and C with the core tools of 5.8.2.1 and 5.8.2.2; DRC by Table 69. No stream and no other decoder: five constructed streams with a tone on each channel, read by both transcriptions, are all that check it. Hearth plays a 9.X.4 presentation as 7.X.4, asking the decoder for that render, which folds the screen pair by the rows above, unless the listener chose a layout; the ESP32 player refuses it. Accepted: no stream of these modes exists outside the project's constructed ones, so neither player has one to play |
| | Efficient high frame rate mode | 🟡🔵 | Low | Nice-to-have | Part 2 5.1.3: the decoder holds the fragments of a presentation whose `frame_rate_fraction` is 2 or 4 in the FIFO of Figure 8 and decodes the concatenated unit at Table 18's audio frame rate; `decode()` returns no frame until a unit's last transmission frame. DEE's immersive stereo at 24, 25 and 29.97 fps, cut into fragments by a test helper, decodes to the same PCM, sample for sample, as the uncut stream, at fractions of 2 and 4. No stream from an encoder uses the mode, so how an encoder fills a fragment is read from the text alone; the encoder does not write it. Accepted: no stream outside the project uses the mode and no second decoder reads it, so the text and DEE's streams cut into fragments are what check it |
| | Object audio: A-JOC and direct-coded objects | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Part 2 6.2.3 to 6.2.8 in both transcriptions, the OAMD substream included; A-JOC's reconstruction (5.7) in full decoding and its downmix or static bed in core decoding, dialogue enhancement for objects (5.8.2.3 to 5.8.2.5), each object's Annex F properties at its update sample, and the ISF renderer (5.10.3); Chromium's `ac4-ajoc.ac4` in both modes, eight constructed streams scored tone by tone. No reference decode to compare with: librempeg refuses object coding, and DEE writes no A-JOC from this project's masters |
| | HSF / 96–192 kHz | 🟡🔵 | Low | Nice-to-have | SIMPLE-mode channel elements (mono, stereo, 3.0, 5.X, 7.X) decode to PCM at 96 and 192 kHz: the extension's scale factors, noise levels and lines in 2x and 4x transforms, SAP, windows, alignment, the converter, the output level gain and the downmix. Checked on streams built from the text only, no real HSF stream being available. A-SPX and A-CPL, SSF, immersive and 22.2, objects, mixing, dialogue enhancement and DRC compression are refused by name at these rates. Accepted: the refusals are where the text stops (clause 5.4: a stream with HSF data uses no QMF domain tool; clause 4.2.4.3's extension covers the mono to 7.X elements, and Part 1's presentation configurations give an HSF extension to the main or music and effects substream alone), and no real HSF stream is available to check the rest |
| | PCM: SIMPLE mono and stereo | 🟢 | High | Essential | ASF, stereo processing, block switching, frame alignment and the QMF banks at `frame_rate_index` 13; DEE's 2.0 streams at unity gain and pinned SNR floors in CI; librempeg agrees to 83 dB or better |
| | PCM: ASPX mono and stereo | 🟢 | High | Essential | Companding and A-SPX in the QMF domain; DEE's 2.0 streams from 48 to 144 kbps at unity gain and its immersive stereo against Lo/Ro, with SNR below the crossover, A-SPX tile energies, LSD and ViSQOL pinned; interleaved waveform coding, balance and VARVAR tested on constructed data |
| | PCM: 3.0, 5.X and 7.X | 🟢 | High | Essential | SIMPLE and ASPX: the LFE, Tables 178 to 183's matrices and routing, A-SPX pairing and companding over Tables 212 and 213; DEE's 5.1 streams from 192 to 768 kbps with every channel scored and pinned, each tone on its own channel, librempeg agreeing to 83 dB; every coding_config, 2ch_mode, chel_matsel, the 3.0 element and the three 7.X modes on constructed streams |
| | PCM: A-CPL | 🟢 | High | Essential | ASPX_ACPL_1 to 3 in the pair, 5.X and 7.X elements: the decorrelators against their difference equations and flat to 1e-9, the ducker, interpolation and dequantisation; DEE's 5.1 at 96 to 144 kbps with the coded downmixes scored as waveforms and each parameter band's level difference and correlation pinned; the other modes on constructed streams. librempeg does not rebuild the surrounds |
| | PCM: other frame rates | 🟢 | High | Essential | Every `frame_rate_index` to 48 kHz through the sample rate converter (the core's: Kaiser-windowed polyphase, 100 dB down from the lower Nyquist frequency), its phase locked to `sequence_counter` as Part 2 5.11 has it and Table 47's counts held; DEE's IMS streams at 23.976, 24, 25 and 29.97 fps scored in CI |
| | Output level and DRC | 🟢 | High | Essential | `Lout`, Table 161's mode selection, the default profiles, transmitted curves and gains, in dB2, with a BS.1770 K-weighted level detector; the output level gain to 0.01 dB for DEE's dialnorms from -31 to -17, each mode's static curve within 0.5 dB; `forge decode output-level= drcmode=`. An alternative presentation's target loudness correction by device category (Part 2 4.8.5.4, Tables 17 and 67) and the real-time loudness correction (4.8.5.5) scale the output as their formulas say, held to them on constructed values; DEE's streams send the real-time one at 0 dB, and no stream sends a target's, so no stream has checked either (`OutputConfig::target_device`) |
| | Downmix | 🟢 | High | Essential | Part 1 6.2.17's cascade from 7.X to 5.X, two channels and mono with the stream's gains and loudness corrections: Lo/Ro, Lt/Rt and Pro Logic II, the LFE at its mix gain; one tone per channel through each matrix equals its formula to 0.01 dB; `forge decode channels= downmix=` |
| | Channel renderer (immersive) | 🟢 | High | Essential | Part 2 5.10.2's Tables 38 to 43 and 45 and 46 from the source's configuration to 7.X.4, 7.X.2, 7.X.0, 5.X.4, 5.X.2 and 5.X.0, with custom downmix data (Table 130's defaults) and the output's loudness correction, and Part 1's Table 218 after 5.X.0 for two channels and mono; every table held against a second transcription; DEE's 5.1.4 legs rendered in both modes equal the matrices to 0.01 dB; DRC's Table 69 groups; `forge decode speakers=` |
| | Presentations and mixing | 🟢 | High | Essential | Part 2 4.8.2's selection, by `presentation_id`, position, language, associated audio and `b_pre_virtualized`, within the decoder's level, for version 0 and 1 presentations: a table of 30 constructed tables of contents in both transcriptions. Music and effects with dialogue, main with associated audio, both, and `presentation_config` 5 mixed as Part 1 6.2.16 and Part 2 4.8.3.17 to 4.8.5 give: group gains, the main audio's scaling, g_dialog and g_assoc, pans, version 0's levelling; every mix of the test multiplexer's streams equals its formula to 0.01 dB, in CI; `forge decode presentation= language= associated= dialogue-gain= associated-gain=` |
| | Start-up, splices and concealment | 🟢 | High | Essential | Decoding from any I-frame gives the whole stream's output from the frame after it, but for A-SPX's noise phase and A-CPL's decorrelators settling; a change of source keeps the signal, so a splice at an I-frame joins the streams without a gap; `ConcealmentPolicy` repeat-and-fade or mute for a frame that does not decode, `forge decode conceal=` |
| | API, reports and packaging | 🟢 | High | Essential | `DecoderConfig`, `OutputConfig` and `Decoder` with every control of the plan's "One control for both formats", changed while a stream plays by `set_output()` and `set_presentation()`; output a frame or 256 samples at a time; each presentation (names sent in chunks included) and the selected one's loudness, DRC, dialogue enhancement and downmix metadata; installed and exported with the inspector and the core, and a program decodes a stream through the installed package by CMake and by pkg-config; a test standing in for the Hearth engine decodes every committed stream through the public API alone, and Hearth's engine plays each one the decoder decodes through it, sample for sample the same (I2) |
| | `forge decode` and `probe` | 🟢 | High | Essential | `decode`: every control above, a presentation with objects rendered to speakers through Hearth's layout renderer, and an option of another format's named in a warning; `probe json=1`: the frame rate, bit rate, I-frames, splices, version 1 presentations, the selected presentation and its metadata |
| | Forge GUI: QC, player and object page | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Each page recognises AC-4 by its sync word and reads it through the public API: QC measures a chosen presentation as `forge qc` does and reports its dialnorm and stated loudness, the player plays a chosen presentation as `forge play` does, and the object page lists the presentations, beds and objects the decoder reports, read-only (the player's Export objects… writes them, I5), and shows each object of an AC-4 file the encoder page wrote at the place and the gain it was given (I5b); Qt Quick Tests over a stream of eight presentations (I3) |
| | Transforms (the core's: FFT, MDCT pair, KBD, QMF banks) | 🟢 | High | Essential | Each against its formula to 1e-12; shared by the decoder and the encoder, with A-SPX's tables and high frequency generator and A-CPL's decorrelators, ducker and tables |
| | ESP32-P4 (`ICLFORGE_MINIMAL_AC4`, `float`) | 🟡 | High | Important | `CONFIG_ICLFORGE_AC4` builds the inspector, core and decoder in the minimum-footprint profile, and `hearth_sink` plays AC-4 from an HTTP source on a board at 360 MHz with Wi-Fi up. 2.0 in SIMPLE mode decodes in real time (0.28 of a frame), 2.0 in A-SPX mode at 0.37 and DEE's immersive stereo through the frame-rate converter at 24, 25, 23.976 and 29.97 fps at 0.51, 0.53, 0.68 and 0.69; 5.1 decodes in real time in SIMPLE mode (0.64), in A-SPX mode (0.83) and in A-SPX mode with A-CPL mode 2 (0.91), A-CPL mode 3 takes 1.14 and 5.1.4 1.57 to 1.90, against 0.18 for E-AC-3 5.1 and 0.37 for 7.1.4 through the same image. The decoder holds 0.58 MB at 2.0 to 2.2 MB at 5.1.4 and its task uses 19 to 30 KB of stack. The probe's six fixtures and all twenty plays decode to the same `float` PCM hashes on the board as on the host and, on their 24-frame cuts, on the Cortex-M3 leg ([ESP32-P4](../platforms/bare-metal/esp32-p4.md#ac-4)) |
| **Encoder (`iclforge::ac4`)** | SIMPLE mono and stereo | 🟢 | High | Essential | 48 and 44.1 kHz, from 8 kbps; block switching, M/S and prediction; SNR, LSD and ViSQOL floors in CI; ahead of DEE on SNR and LSD at 192 kbps |
| | Frame writer, sync frame, MP4 and `dac4` | 🟢 | High | Essential | Encoder, decoder and Python traces agree record for record (tests, `fuzz_ac4_encode`, encoder-space harness); FFmpeg frames it; MediaInfo and DEE's MP4 muxer read it as configured. The `dac4` describes every presentation (Part 2 Annex E.10: each configuration's substream groups, A-JOC and direct-coded object groups, an alternative presentation's name and target), byte for byte as DEE's muxer writes it for Chromium's A-JOC stream and DASH-IF's vectors, or `dac4_refusal()` says what it cannot; `cmaf_refusal()` names the rule of Annex H.1.2.1 a stream breaks, and `forge fmp4` refuses such a stream |
| | ASPX mono and stereo | 🟢 | High | Essential | Below 96 kbps a channel: A-SPX with DEE's crossovers, FIXFIX, FIXVAR and VARFIX framing, sinusoids, companding below 64 kbps a channel; SNR below the crossover, A-SPX tiles, LSD and ViSQOL pinned in CI; ViSQOL within 0.03 of DEE's or above it from 64 to 144 kbps. Balance, VARVAR and frequency interleaving behind `experimental=` |
| | SIMPLE and ASPX 5.0 and 5.1 | 🟢 | High | Essential | The 5.X element in DEE's form: L/R and Ls/Rs pairs, C, the LFE to 140.6 Hz; ASPX below 384 kbps for 5.1, at DEE's 5.1 crossovers; each channel's tone on its own channel, the LFE's included; librempeg decodes it as the decoder does, to 82.5 dB; SNR, LSD and ViSQOL pinned in CI, and the race against DEE from 192 to 768 kbps. Coding configurations 1 to 3, `2ch_mode` 1, and 7.0 and 7.1 in the 7.X element behind `experimental=` |
| | A-CPL 5.0 and 5.1 | 🟢 | High | Essential | ASPX_ACPL_3 and ASPX_ACPL_2 at DEE's rates, with DEE's A-SPX configuration; each band's parameters from each subband's own band; each tone on its own channel; the coded downmixes, each band's level difference and correlation, LSD and ViSQOL pinned in CI, and the race against DEE at 96 to 144 kbps; MediaInfo and DEE's muxer read it, and librempeg decodes its coded channels. ASPX_ACPL_1 and A-CPL in stereo behind `experimental=acpl` |
| | Frame rates, rate modes and I-frames | 🟢 | High | Essential | Every frame rate of Part 1 Table 83 at 48 kHz, through the decoder's converter in the other direction, each frame's samples locked to `sequence_counter` and exact over 100 000 frames at each rate; LSD and ViSQOL within pinned allowances of index 13 in CI; average and variable rates, the average one within the buffer `wait_frames` signals, checked frame by frame; I-frames at an interval, at named frames and at fragment starts, an MP4's sync samples |
| | Metadata | 🟢 | High | Essential | Further loudness values, measured with the BS.1770 meter; DRC's decoder modes on the default profile, on curves of their own or repeating another; the stereo downmix's values; dialogue enhancement from marked channels or a stem, by the channel-independent, Mid and cross-channel methods. MediaInfo reads each value as written over 42 configurations, and the decoder's output level, downmixes and dialogue enhancement gains equal their formulas on the encoder's streams, in CI. Transmitted DRC gains behind `experimental=drc-gains-N` |
| | Presentations and several substreams | 🟢 | High | Essential | Part 2 Table 53's configurations over substreams in groups of their own: music and effects with dialogue, main with dialogue enhancement (the hybrid methods' waveform in a substream of its own), main with associated audio, music and effects with both, main with both, roles by classifier, and EMDF payloads alone; alternative presentations and their names, languages, classifiers, group gains, each presentation's least `md_compat`, the dialogue's and the associated audio's mixing values, EMDF payloads passed through; CMAF's limits held. D7's selection and mixing give every configured presentation to 0.01 dB on the encoder's streams, in CI; MediaInfo lists the presentations, names, languages and levels as configured. 3.0 dialogue behind the experimental options. `forge ac4-encode` takes them (`substreamN=`, `presentationN=`), and the encoder-space harness draws them |
| | API, CLI and packaging | 🟢 | High | Essential | `EncoderConfig`, every field with a default for designated initializers, and `Encoder`, whose `refusal_reason()` names the rule a configuration breaks; `sync_frame()` for raw files and MPEG-2 TS; `forge ac4-encode` with an option for each setting, every option tested; installed and exported with the decoder (`iclforge::ac4_static`, `iclforge::ac4_shared`, pkg-config `iclforge-ac4`), and a program encodes through the installed package by CMake and by pkg-config |
| | Forge GUI encode | 🟢 | Medium | Important | The AC-4 tab: one source in its own layout, mono to 5.1, to a raw stream or an MP4 file, with the frame rate, rate and codec modes, dialnorm and loudness, DRC, the stereo downmix, dialogue enhancement, the I-frame interval and the CRC; the page echoes the `forge ac4-encode` line, which writes the same bytes, raw and MP4, in the Qt Quick Tests (I3). With AC-4 chosen the Objects tab writes AC-4 objects, A-JOC by default or direct-coded, to a raw stream or an MP4 file (I5b): the page gives the writer's limits (frame_rate_index 13, 64 objects, one LFE) in its own text, names a request it cannot write before Encode is pressed, and greys out the controls that cannot apply; its echoed `forge atmos-encode … codec=ac4` line writes the same bytes, raw and MP4, in the Qt Quick Tests, the two running the object steps in `apps/shared/media/src`; an ADM master's two beds and one moving object, authored on the page, decode in the GUI's object decoding within I5's 0.06 a position axis and 2 dB. Substreams, presentations and the other layouts stay with the command line |
| | Immersive layouts | 🟢 | High | Essential | 5.0.4 and 5.1.4 in the immersive element as DEE writes it, in SCPL, ASPX_SCPL and ASPX_ACPL_2 by the rate; 7.0.4 and 7.1.4, ASPX_ACPL_1 and A-JCC behind `experimental=`; the race against DEE's 5.1.4 from 192 to 768 kbps (phase E8) |
| | Objects | 🟡 | Medium | Essential | Behind `experimental=objects` (phase E9): A-JOC substreams over a computed downmix or a static 5.0 or 5.1 bed, the matrices chosen by running the decoder's reconstruction, bed objects, the LFE and decorrelators; direct-coded dynamic objects; object audio metadata with each update at its sample. Each object decodes at 40 to 75 dB SNR against its source and core decoding gives the downmix at its metadata, pinned in CI; the three traces agree. No reader outside the project has checked it: DEE writes no A-JOC from this project's masters, librempeg refuses object coding, and MediaInfo's reading waits for a run where DEE is installed |

## Stream carriage and containers

| Category | Feature | Status | Priority | Criticality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Boxes** | `dac3` / `dec3` (incl. Atmos extension, Annex F) | 🟢 | High | Essential | Built from the bitstream, not the container claim |
| | Legacy core+E-AC-3 extension sample entry | 🔴 | Medium | Important | Decode/scan via `kAc3CoreEac3Extension`; mux refuses rather than emit a contradictory box |
| | `dac4` + MPEG-TS DVB registration | 🟢 | Medium | Important | AC-4 carriage |
| | MPEG-TS AC-4 ATSC profile (A/342-2) | 🔴 | Low | Optional | Explicitly refused; DVB path only |

| | MP4 `moov`-after-`mdat` streaming demux | 🔴 | Low | Optional | Refused with explanation |
| | Fragmented MP4 / CMAF | 🟢 | High | Essential | Init + media segments; AC-4 by TS 103 190-2 Annex H (fragments start at I-frames, `ca4m`/`ca4s` brands, Annex G's descriptors) |
| | Matroska | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Mux + demux for AC-3 and E-AC-3 |
| | Matroska AC-4 | 🔴 | Low | Out-of-scope | Refused: Matroska registers no codec ID for AC-4 |
| | MPEG-TS (DVB + ATSC for AC-3/E-AC-3) | 🟢 | High | Essential | Mux + demux; descriptors from `scan` |
| | Multi-programme container mux | 🟡 | Medium | Optional | CLI muxers warn and carry the first programme only |
| **Streaming** | HLS playlists | 🟡 | Medium | Important | Atmos `CHANNELS="N/JOC"` + 5.1 fallback; manifest semantics not player-validated |

## Cross-cutting library surface

| Category | Feature | Status | Priority | Criticality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **API** | C++23 `iclforge::ac3` | 🟢 | High | Essential | Encode / decode / inspect / measure |
| | Minimum-footprint decoder (`iclforge::ac3_minimal`) | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Bare-metal / ESP32 profile |
| | Minimum-footprint AC-4 decoder (`iclforge::ac4` in `float`) | 🟡 | Medium | Important | The decode profile carries the decoder, its inspector and core, static and without exceptions (`ICLFORGE_MINIMAL_AC4` with `ICLFORGE_MINIMAL_DECODER`); the Cortex-M3 probe decodes six committed streams (2.0, 5.1 and 5.1.4, one with companding) with the PCM bit-identical to the x86-64 host's, 432 KB to 1.93 MB of heap and 54.5 M to 205.8 M instructions a frame. The ESP32-P4 runs it on a board (D14b, the row of that name under the decoder). The ESP32-S3 runs it under QEMU in CI with its state in PSRAM, the PCM equal to the pins and 3 to 14 KB of internal RAM in use, and has not run it on a board (D14c, [ESP32-S3](../platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md#ac-4)); the C6 builds it in the fixed-point tier and it does not fit beside WiFi (D14d, [ESP32-C6](../platforms/bare-metal/esp32-c6.md#ac-4)) |
| | C API (`iclforge::c`) | 🟢 | Medium | Important | Stable minimal surface; AC-4 added (phase I4), with the encoder's objects (phase I4b) |
| | Python / Rust / WASM bindings | 🟢 | Medium | Important | AC-4 added to the C API, Python, Rust and WASM (phase I4), with the encoder's objects and the decoder's update ramps (phase I4b) and typed AC-4 exceptions in Python. The wheels on PyPI (0.10.0b1 and earlier) predate the AC-4 module, and the WASM package is not on npm |
| **Verify** | Encoder/decoder mirror traces | 🟢 | High | Essential | AC-3 and E-AC-3 (`iclforge::ac3::verify`); AC-4 has a syntax trace of both directions (`iclforge/ac4/core/syntax.hpp`) |
| | Research trace export (CSV / JSONL) | 🟢 | Low | Optional | `iclforge::ac3::verify` |
| | Conformance / fuzz / quality gates | 🟢 | High | Essential | See [Validation](../verification.md) |
| | Cross-toolchain encoder bit-identical output | 🟡 | Medium | Important | Audit + `ilogb` fix done; FP thresholds / cross-leg gate still open (VX12) |
| | Listening-test apparatus (MUSHRA/ABX) | 🟡 | Low | Optional | Tools under `tools/listening/`; no human session run (VX9) |
| | Perceptual encoder criterion calibration | 🔴 | Medium | Optional | Proposed as EQ14; not wired |
| **Audio I/O** | Capture / monitor / passthrough | 🟡 | Medium | Important | `iclforge::audio` in-tree only; every output backend now stops itself on device loss (Windows passthrough-unplug hardware-confirmed), but platform verification stays uneven |
| | Sink capability discovery (EDID / ELD) | 🟡 | Medium | Important | Used for passthrough negotiation; uneven across platforms |
| | AC-4 passthrough | 🟡 | Low | Optional | ALSA and Android; WASAPI, PipeWire and CoreAudio name no AC-4 format and refuse it; AC-4 HBR16's eight-channel link refused everywhere; no receiver to test |
| **Out of scope** | Headphone / binaural renderer | 🔴 | Low | Out-of-scope | Deliberate product boundary (external renderer) |

## How to read a yellow or red row

- **🟡 Partial** means the feature exists with a documented bound (parser narrower than commercial streams, syntax without PCM, branch not merged, intentional `auto` exclusion called out elsewhere). The bound is the note; the prose is in [Capabilities](capabilities.md).
- **🔴 Not started / refused / out of scope** means no implementation on `main` for that specification surface, or an explicit refuse. Roadmap IDs in the notes point at [Roadmap](../roadmap.md) where one exists.
- Oracle and hardware gaps are **not** red features by themselves. A completed encoder whose only external decoder is this project's own is still 🟢, with the gap recorded under [Validation](../verification.md) and noted in the standards register where useful.
