# ADM / BW64 reading and writing: `iclforge::adm`

`iclforge/adm/ac3adm.hpp`, library `iclforge::adm`. A standalone BW64/RF64 + Audio Definition Model
(ADM) parser and writer: the professional delivery format Netflix's and Apple's own Atmos ingest
pipelines require. Like `iclforge::matroska`, `iclforge::mp4` and `iclforge::mpegts`, it links nothing
from `iclforge::ac3` — it has no idea AC-3, E-AC-3 or the JOC/Atmos object layer exist.

Mapping the graph this module parses onto `iclforge::ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder` (ADM → encode) or building it
from a decoded `iclforge::ac3::Eac3Decoder` programme (decode → ADM) is a separate module,
[`iclforge::adm`](adm-bridge.md); driving the read direction end to end — a real ADM BWF master
straight to a DD+ JOC E-AC-3 stream — is `forge atmos-adm`, and the write direction is
`forge decode ... adm_out` (see [Commands](../forge/cli/commands.md)) and
[`examples/encode_adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/encode_adm.cpp). This page and
[`examples/read_adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/read_adm.cpp) only demonstrate this module's own read-side API — opening a file and walking the
parsed graph; `encode_adm.cpp` is the one that shows the full read-direction pipeline. See
"Writing" below for `write_bw64()`.

**Opt-in, unlike every other module in this library.** `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM` defaults **off**, and
turning it on additionally needs `-DVCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES=adm` (see
[`vcpkg.json`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/vcpkg.json)) to resolve its Boost dependency:

```bash
cmake --preset config-windows-msvc-debug -DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON -DVCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES=adm
```

Every other target in this project — `forge`, `forge-gui`, `iclforge-tests`, every other example — builds
identically whether `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM` is on or off; nothing links `iclforge::adm`
unconditionally. See "Why opt-in" below for the reasoning.

```cpp
const auto document = iclforge::adm::parse_bw64(fixture_path);
if (!document) {
    fmt::printf("parse_bw64 failed: %.*s\n", static_cast<int>(iclforge::adm::describe(document.error()).size()),
                iclforge::adm::describe(document.error()).data());
    return 1;
}
```

```cpp
for (const auto& programme : document->model.programmes) {
    fmt::printf("  programme %s (%s) -> %zu content(s)\n", programme.id.c_str(), programme.name.c_str(),
                programme.content_refs.size());
}
for (const auto& object : document->model.objects) {
    fmt::printf("  object %s (%s), start=%.5fs, %zu track UID ref(s)\n", object.id.c_str(), object.name.c_str(),
                object.start_s, object.track_uid_refs.size());
}
```

Full program: [`examples/read_adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/read_adm.cpp) — writes a small but valid BW64 fixture (adapted
from Recommendation ITU-R BS.2076-2's own worked "Car" object example) to a temp file, since a
real ADM BWF master is production audio this project has no license to embed, then parses it
back and prints what it found.

## What gets parsed

- **The container** (Recommendation ITU-R BS.2088-1, Annex 1): `<fmt >`/`<data>` integer PCM
  (8/16/24/32-bit) and IEEE float (32/64-bit — see "PCM formats" below), the `<ds64>` 64-bit
  size table for `RF64`/`BW64`-headed files, `<chna>` (the track-number ↔ ADM-ID join table) and
  `<axml>` (the embedded ADM XML document itself). A plain `RIFF` header is accepted too, for
  the (very common) case of a master that stays under the 4 GB threshold RF64 exists to lift.
- **The ADM object graph** (Recommendation ITU-R BS.2076-2, Annex 1): `audioProgramme` →
  `audioContent` → `audioObject` → `audioPackFormat`/`audioChannelFormat` (with its
  `audioBlockFormat` time-divisions — position, gain, width/height/depth, `channelLock`,
  `jumpPosition`, `zoneExclusion`, `objectDivergence`, `screenRef`, `headLocked`, HOA
  order/degree/normalization) → `audioStreamFormat`/`audioTrackFormat` →
  `audioTrackUID`. See [`iclforge/adm/model.hpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/src/adm/include/iclforge/adm/model.hpp) for exactly which sub-elements are carried and which
  are deliberately out of scope (the Matrix block's coefficients, which libadm has no model for,
  the Binaural-specific sub-elements, and loudness metadata — `iclforge::ac3::meta::loudness`
  already measures loudness independently).

**`zoneExclusion` is read by this module, not by libadm.** libadm's parser and writer both leave a
`TODO: zoneExclusion` where it would go, and its XML tokenizer is private. `parse_bw64` therefore
scans the same `<axml>` text a second time for `<zoneExclusion>` elements and attaches each
block's `zone` children (`label`, and the six Cartesian bounds when given) to
`AudioBlockFormat::zone_exclusion`; `write_bw64` adds the element to libadm's output the same way.
The scan runs only after libadm has accepted the document, so it does not validate anything. The
other three elements are libadm's own.

**`model` always includes BS.2076-2 Annex A's "common definitions".** libadm's own `parseXml()`
starts every document from a copy already populated with the standard's ~940 predefined
pack/channel/stream/track/block formats (one set per standard loudspeaker layout and first- to
third-order HOA component) and merges the file's own content into it, so that a file referencing
a common-definition ID (e.g. a stereo bed's pack format `AP_00010002`) without locally
re-declaring it still resolves. This module keeps that merge rather than filtering it back out:
[`iclforge::adm`](adm-bridge.md) needs exactly this, a pack/channel/stream/track format reference that resolves regardless
of whether the file re-declared it — so `model.pack_formats`/`channel_formats`/`stream_formats`/
`track_formats` are never just "what this one file defined". `model.programmes`/`contents`/
`objects`/`track_uids` are unaffected (the common set defines none of those four).

`AdmDocument` — the `parse_bw64` result — holds all three pieces together: `model` (the graph
above), `chna` (the join table, one `ChnaEntry` per physical-track-to-ADM-ID row), and `audio`
(the decoded PCM, one `std::vector<float>` per channel, same `[-1, 1)` normalization convention
`iclforge::ac3::io::WavData` uses). `AdmError` covers open/parse failure — `kCannotOpen`, `kNotRiff`,
`kMalformedXml`, `kMalformedAdm`, `kOther`;
see [`iclforge/adm/ac3adm.hpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/src/adm/include/iclforge/adm/ac3adm.hpp) for the full list. In practice, the two libraries underneath this
module (see below) report almost everything through one broad exception family each, so most
real failures surface as `kCannotOpen` (bad/truncated container), `kMalformedXml` (axml
isn't well-formed XML) or `kMalformedAdm` (well-formed XML that isn't a valid ADM document) — see
[`src/adm/src/adm.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/src/adm/src/adm.cpp)'s own comments for exactly which library exception maps to which `AdmError`.

## Writing

`write_bw64(path, document)` is the read side's mirror image: it turns an `AdmModel` (the same
plain-data graph `parse_bw64` produces) into a libadm `adm::Document` (a new translator,
`build_libadm_document()` in `src/adm/src/adm_model.cpp`, alongside the existing read-side
`build_adm_model()`), serializes it with `adm::writeXml()`, and writes the BW64 container
(`<fmt >`/`<chna>`/`<axml>`/`<data>`) with libbw64's `Bw64Writer` (`bw64::writeFile()`) — the same
two vendored libraries as the read side, in the other direction. 24-bit integer PCM by default
(`iclforge::adm::kWriteBitDepth`; `EBU Tech 3306`'s own framing); a third argument,
`AdmWriteOptions{.bit_depth, .float_samples}`, selects 16/24/32-bit integer or 32/64-bit IEEE float
(anything else is `AdmWriteError::kInvalidOptions`, and no file is created). The sample rate is
written at its full 32-bit width.

```cpp
iclforge::adm::AdmDocument document;
// ... populate document.model / document.chna / document.audio ...
const auto written = iclforge::adm::write_bw64(path, document);
if (!written) {
    fmt::printf("write_bw64 failed: %.*s\n", static_cast<int>(iclforge::adm::describe(written.error()).size()),
                iclforge::adm::describe(written.error()).data());
    return 1;
}
```

One asymmetry from the read side: `AdmModel`'s own ID strings (`AudioObject::id`,
`ChnaEntry::uid`, ...) are used only as correlation keys while the object graph is wired together
— they never appear literally in the written file. Real, BS.2076-2-formatted IDs come from
libadm's own `adm::reassignIds()`, called once the whole graph is built; `write_bw64` reads those
back to build `<chna>`'s `AudioId` rows. A caller is therefore free to use any unique, stable
strings for `id`/`uid` fields, not just the `"AO_1001"`-style ones `parse_bw64` itself produces.
`ChnaEntry::track_ref`/`pack_ref` are consequently read-path-only fields — `write_bw64` derives
the real `trackRef`/`packRef` strings itself, so a caller building a document purely to write it
may leave both empty.

`AudioTrackUid::has_bit_depth`/`bit_depth` are not read on write either. Every `audioTrackUID` is
written with `bitDepth` equal to the `<fmt >` chunk's bits per sample (`AdmWriteOptions::bit_depth`), whatever
the model says, because a value carried over from another file (a 16-bit master the model was
parsed from, say) would contradict the `<fmt >` chunk written beside it. The Dolby Atmos Master ADM
Profile expects the two to agree: Dolby Encoding Engine refuses a master whose `audioTrackUID`s
leave `bitDepth` out ("Mismatched track bit depth between ADM and WAV"). `sampleRate` is written
from the model wherever `has_sample_rate` is set. On the read side both attributes are optional
(BS.2076-2 §5.9), and `parse_bw64` reports which were present through `has_sample_rate` and
`has_bit_depth`.

`write_bw64`'s own translator supports exactly the element shapes [ADM → Atmos bridging](adm-bridge.md)'s
write direction (`iclforge::adm::write()`) produces: `audioProgramme` → `audioContent` →
`audioObject` (no nesting) → `audioPackFormat` (`Objects` or `DirectSpeakers`, no nesting) →
`audioChannelFormat` (cartesian `audioBlockFormat`s only) → `audioStreamFormat` → `audioTrackFormat`
→ `audioTrackUID`. `iclforge::adm::write()` always populates the full `audioStreamFormat`/
`audioTrackFormat` chain rather than BS.2076-2's plain-PCM shortcut (`audioTrackUID` referencing
`audioPackFormat`/`audioChannelFormat` directly, with no stream/track format at all) — libadm's own
`adm::reassignIds()` zeroes out any `audioChannelFormat` no `audioStreamFormat` references ("get an
Id with the value zero and are thereby marked as ADM elements which should be ignored" -
`adm/utilities/id_assignment.hpp`'s own doc comment), which the shortcut alone triggers; every
channel this writer produced collapsed to the same `AC_00000000` id before this chain was added.
`AdmWriteError::kInvalidDocument` covers every case outside that shape: an unresolved `*_refs`
entry, Matrix/HOA/Binaural pack or channel types, nested references, an `audioTrackUID` that names
both an `audioTrackFormat` and an `audioChannelFormat`, or a block whose position is polar rather
than cartesian (a default-constructed `AudioBlockFormat` is one: its `position` starts as
`PolarPosition{}`). An exception libadm or libbw64 throws once the document is built comes back as
`kOther` — `adm::formatId()` throws for an ID field that overflows, such as a 256th
`audioTrackFormat` on one `audioStreamFormat`.

## Built on the EBU's own reference implementations

Unlike every other module in this project, `iclforge::adm` is not a from-scratch implementation
of its format. It is a thin translation layer over two vendored third-party libraries, fetched
via CMake `FetchContent` (see [`src/adm/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/src/adm/CMakeLists.txt)):

- **[libbw64](https://github.com/pwnified/libbw64)** (Apache-2.0, header-only, no dependency of
  its own) — the BW64/RF64 chunk-walking and PCM-decoding layer, including native IEEE-float
  support. Fetched from a maintained fork of the EBU's own `github.com/ebu/libbw64`, pinned to a
  commit rather than a tag or branch — see
  [`src/adm/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/src/adm/CMakeLists.txt)
  for why the EBU's own repository is not what this module fetches, and
  [the threat model](../threat-model.md#adm-xml-and-bw64) for what the pin does and does not
  cover. Patched at populate time by
  [`src/adm/patch_libbw64.cmake`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/src/adm/patch_libbw64.cmake)
  for two behaviours this module's own tests need that the pinned commit does not have by
  default (a truncated recording reading as far as it goes; 64-bit float actually reaching the
  decode this fork's own utilities already support) — see that script.
- **[libadm](https://github.com/ebu/libadm)** (Apache-2.0) — the ADM XML object model: parsing,
  schema validation, and the full element graph.

libadm is the EBU/BBC/IRT team's own repository, the same team that authored the underlying ITU-R
Recommendations (BS.2088-1, BS.2076-2) themselves; libbw64's fork carries that team's original
code forward with fixes of its own on top. Using both means this module's own code only has to
translate an already-validated object graph into `iclforge::adm`'s own types
([`src/adm/src/adm_model.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/src/adm/src/adm_model.cpp)), rather than re-implementing container-walking and XML/schema
validation this project has no comparative advantage in getting exactly right on the first try.
An earlier attempt at exactly that hand-rolled approach is what prompted switching to these
libraries instead.

Neither library's own types appear in `iclforge::adm`'s public headers
(`iclforge/adm/ac3adm.hpp`, `iclforge/adm/model.hpp`) — they are translated into this module's own types at
the boundary and stay an implementation detail, the same way this project keeps every other
vendored dependency (e.g. Catch2 in `tests/`) out of its own public API. One practical reason
beyond the usual "don't leak a dependency's API" one: libadm's own public C++ namespace is `adm`,
which is why this module's namespace is `iclforge::adm`, nested under the family's root, and every
unqualified use of libadm's names in this project is written `::adm::` (`adm::AudioObject`,
`adm::TypeDefinition`, `adm::Position`, ... are all defined by both).

## Why opt-in

libadm needs several Boost header libraries (Optional, Variant, Range, Iterator, Functional,
Format, Integer and Rational — the exact list confirmed by grepping libadm 0.14.0's own
`#include <boost/...>` directives, not guessed from its README, which undersells it: Rational
and Integer aren't mentioned there at all, but `adm/utilities/time_conversion.hpp` needs both).
Every other dependency in this project is either in-tree or a single small vcpkg
package (Catch2); pulling in Boost is a materially bigger footprint, so it is deliberately
**opt-in rather than default-on** — `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM` defaults `OFF` (unlike
`ICLFORGE_BUILD_MATROSKA`/`ICLFORGE_BUILD_MP4`/`ICLFORGE_BUILD_MPEGTS`, which default `ON`), and
turning it on needs the dedicated `adm` vcpkg feature to resolve those Boost packages. A build
with `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=OFF` (the default) never touches `find_package(Boost)`, never fetches
libbw64/libadm, and behaves identically to a build of this project before this module existed.

`iclforge::adm` IS part of the installed `find_package(iclforge)` package (see
[the library overview](index.md)), but **shared-only** — unlike every other module here, there is
no `iclforge::adm_static` to link against, since a static archive would leave a downstream
consumer with unresolved symbols into libbw64/libadm (neither installed/exported by this project
in its own right); a self-contained `.so` absorbs both at its own build step instead. It is
**not** wired into the Android/Shield NDK build — see `src/adm/CMakeLists.txt`'s own header
comment for both points.

## PCM formats

Integer PCM (8/16/24/32-bit) and IEEE float (32/64-bit) both read, through the vendored libbw64
directly, and both come back as the same `[-1, 1)` floats on `PcmAudio::channels`.
`bits_per_sample` reports the container width and is not, on its own, a statement about which of
the two it was.

This module used to need a second, hand-rolled container walk for float specifically: the EBU's
own libbw64 refuses any `<fmt >` `formatTag` but PCM outright at open time
(`"format unsupported: <tag>"`), and patching a dependency fetched at a pinned tag to teach it a
feature of this project's own was judged a worse standing cost than a second, narrower reader.
The pinned fork (see above) added native `WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT` support upstream of this
module, so that second reader (`float_pcm_bw64.hpp`, retired) is no longer needed — both formats
go through the identical libbw64 read and the identical libadm `<axml>` parse now, so there is
exactly one place either one could come out differently depending on how the samples were
stored, not two.

A file libbw64 opens and then rejects surfaces as `AdmError::kCannotOpen`; its exceptions carry
no type this module could map to anything more specific — see
[`ac3adm.hpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/src/adm/include/iclforge/adm/ac3adm.hpp)'s
own comment on `AdmError`.

Most real ADM BWF masters are 16- or 24-bit integer (EBU Tech 3306/BS.2088-1 Annex 2 §2's own
PCM-only framing). Float ones exist too.
