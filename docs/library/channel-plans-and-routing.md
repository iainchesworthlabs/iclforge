# Channel plans & routing

`iclforge::ac3::plan::LayoutId` only ever names eight hand-picked combinations (mono through 7.1.4). The
two APIs on this page are the general machinery underneath: any Table E2.5 channel selection at
all, and any number of separate sources feeding it.

## Custom channel selections: `Plan::custom_locations`

`iclforge/ac3/encoder/plan.hpp` and `iclforge/ac3/core/eac3_tables.hpp`. `iclforge::ac3::eac3::chanmap::allocate` partitions
an arbitrary set of Table E2.5 locations into a bed (the widest Table 5.8 acmod whose own
locations all fit) and however many dependents the remainder needs. `Plan::custom_locations`
is the front door onto it: set it and it overrides `layout` entirely.

```cpp
const auto locations = iclforge::ac3::plan::parse_channels("L,C,R,Ls,Rs,LFE,Ts,Lw,Rw");

const iclforge::ac3::plan::Plan plan{
    .codec = iclforge::ac3::plan::Codec::kEac3,
    .custom_locations = *locations,
    .bitrate_kbps = 640,
};
```

```cpp
const auto channel_plan = iclforge::ac3::plan::resolve(plan);   // the bed + dependent chanmaps
const auto config = iclforge::ac3::plan::eac3_config(plan);      // AccessUnitConfig, ready to encode
iclforge::ac3::eac3::AccessUnitEncoder encoder{config};
```

Full program: [`examples/custom_layout.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/custom_layout.cpp)
— 5.1 plus a top-surround channel and a front-wide pair, a layout no `LayoutId` names, built and
encoded the same way a caller with an unusual speaker set would.

`parse_channels`/`format_channels` round-trip a comma-separated list of Table E2.5 names
(`iclforge::ac3::eac3::chanmap::name()`'s own spelling, e.g. `"Ls"`, `"LFE2"`); a pair location (Lc/Rc,
Lrs/Rrs, Lsd/Rsd, Lw/Rw, Vhl/Vhr, Lts/Rts) must name both members, since Table E2.5 has no bit
for one alone. `allocate()` fails with `AllocationError::kNoBedFit` if no Table 5.8 acmod's own
locations are a subset of the request, or `kOrphanLfe2` if `LFE2` is asked for with no
full-bandwidth channel left to share its substream.

`iclforge::ac3::plan::coded_channels(plan)`/`coded_channel_names(plan)` work over a resolved
`ChannelPlan` exactly the way they do over a named `LayoutId` — a custom selection and a named
layout go through the same reporting path.

`Plan::codec` can also be `Codec::kAc4`, for a front end that hands the plan's channels, rate and
metadata to `iclforge::ac4::Encoder` ([AC-4](ac4.md)); `iclforge::ac3` itself encodes AC-3 and E-AC-3 only, so
`eac3_config(plan)` has nothing to say about it. `iclforge::ac3::plan::validate(plan)` holds an AC-4 plan to
what the AC-4 encoder takes from a plan: the named layouts mono, stereo and 5.1, or a
`custom_locations` selection that is mono, stereo, 5.0 or 5.1, at 48 or 44.1 kHz, with no `vbr`
(`PlanError::kLayoutNotInAc4`, `kSampleRateNotInAc4` and `kVbrNeedsEac3`). `forge ac4-encode`
does not go through a plan: it takes the immersive layouts, and the experimental 7.X and 3.0 ones,
from the WAV file's own channels.

## One source that states its speakers

A width is not a layout: three channels are 3/0 as FL FR FC and 2/1 as FL FR BC, and four are 2/2
as FL FR BL BR and 3/1 as FL FR FC BC. `route(target, channels, ...)` has only the count, so it
reads three as L R C and four as L R Ls Rs, which is right for the files that are those and wrong
for the rest. A `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` header's `dwChannelMask` says which, and four functions
carry it from the file to an encoder the way `forge` and Forge GUI both do:

```cpp
using namespace iclforge::ac3;
const auto read = io::read_wav(path);                       // WavData::channel_mask
const auto stated = plan::wav_mask_locations(read->channel_mask, read->channels.size());
if (stated) {                                               // nullopt: states none, or none usable
    if (const auto chosen = plan::source_layout(plan::Codec::kAc3, *stated)) {
        if (chosen->layout) { p.layout = *chosen->layout; }
        else { p.custom_locations = chosen->custom_locations; }
    }
    const auto routing = plan::route(plan::resolve(p), *stated, clev, slev);
}
```

`wav_mask_locations` returns one Table E2.5 location per channel in file order, and nothing for a
mask that is 0, names a different number of speakers than the file has channels, or names one
Table E2.5 has no location for (`SPEAKER_TOP_BACK_CENTER`); `SPEAKER_BACK_LEFT/RIGHT` are the
surrounds on their own and the rear surrounds beside the sides, as `iclforge::audio::locations_of`
reads them (a test holds the two to each other). `source_layout` answers with the named layout that
renders exactly those locations, or else a custom selection, and nothing for a set the codec cannot
carry (AC-3 has no dependent substream). The located `route()` takes the source as it states itself:
a 2/1 source folds to stereo by 2/1's §7.8 coefficients, a 5.1.2 file sent to 7.1 is panned to it
rather than read as 7.1 because it is as wide, and a location named twice is refused.
`plan::wav_channel_mask(locations)` is the inverse for a file about to be written, which is how
`forge decode` states the speakers of what it writes.

## Multiple sources: `iclforge::ac3::plan::Assignment`

`iclforge/ac3/encoder/assignment.hpp`. `plan::route()`'s other overload places *one* source by
direction — the microphone-onto-5.1 case. A caller with several sources — several files,
several capture devices, or dual mono's two independent programmes — instead says exactly
where each of *their* channels goes, channel by channel.

```cpp
const std::array<iclforge::ac3::plan::SourceShape, 2> sources{{
    {.channels = 2, .label = "music.wav"},
    {.channels = 1, .label = "voiceover.wav"},
}};

iclforge::ac3::plan::Assignment assignment;
assignment.set(0, 0, {.kind = iclforge::ac3::plan::DestinationKind::kLocation, .location = Location::kLeft});
assignment.set(0, 1, {.kind = iclforge::ac3::plan::DestinationKind::kLocation, .location = Location::kRight});
// -6 dB under the music, so the voiceover reads without burying it.
assignment.set(1, 0, {.kind = iclforge::ac3::plan::DestinationKind::kLocation,
                      .location = Location::kCentre,
                      .trim_db = -6.0});
```

```cpp
const auto routing = iclforge::ac3::plan::route(target, sources, assignment);
iclforge::ac3::plan::render(*routing, source_views, coded_views, iclforge::ac3::kSamplesPerFrame);
```

Full program: [`examples/multi_source_assignment.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/multi_source_assignment.cpp)
— a stereo music bed and a separate mono voiceover, combined onto one 5.1 stream.

`Destination::kind` is a closed set: `kUnassigned`, `kLocation`, `kObject`, `kObjectMono` (a
channel range folded to one mono dynamic object), `kProgramme1`/`kProgramme2` (dual mono).
`trim_db` is a linear-gain trim in decibels, applied wherever that channel's content reaches
the stream — a `route()`-built `Routing` gain entry for `kLocation` rows and for dual mono's
`kProgramme1`/`kProgramme2` rows (`dual_mono_routing()` carries them the same way), or the object
plane's own gain for `kObject`/`kObjectMono` (`route()` contributes nothing for those: object
audio reaches the stream through the Atmos path, not `Routing`). `set()` and
`parse_destination()` clamp it to `[-24, +24]` and snap it to a tenth-of-a-dB grid — a fixed grid
rather than an arbitrary `double` is what lets `format_destination`/`parse_destination`
round-trip a trim exactly. A `kUnassigned` row always reads 0, since `set()` erases those rather
than storing them.

`route()` returns `nullopt` if `sources` is empty, if two rows target the same location, or if
the target plan cannot express a requested location at all — it does **not** require every
target channel to be filled; an unassigned coded channel is simply silent, which
`Assignment::unassigned(sources)` reports back for a caller (a GUI's warning banner) to show.
`dual_mono_routing()` is the same idea specialised to 1+1's two independent programmes, one
channel on each. `format_assignment`/`parse_assignment` round-trip the whole assignment through
the CLI's `map=` grammar (`kAssignmentSyntax` documents it in full).
