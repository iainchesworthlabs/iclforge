# Object signing: `iclforge::ac3::signing`

`iclforge/ac3/signing/emdf_atmos_signer.hpp` (the signer, a part of `iclforge::ac3`) and
`iclforge/base/crypto/signing_key.hpp` (the operator's key, `iclforge::base`'s). Signing is an
optional step a front end applies to already-encoded frames: no encoder or decoder source calls the
signer, and the minimum-footprint archives leave it out. See [Object signing](../concepts/object-signing.md) for
what this is *for* — a licensed decoder treats the EMDF container's `emdf_protection` field as a
commitment to object decoding and refuses the whole stream if the tag does not check out; this
computes the keyed tag that satisfies it.

```cpp
const iclforge::base::crypto::SigningKey key{key_bytes};   // the operator's own, at runtime
const int signed_count = iclforge::ac3::signing::sign_atmos_stream(stream, key);
```

Full program: [`examples/object_signing.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/object_signing.cpp)
— encodes a two-object Atmos stream, then signs it. The key used there is a literal stand-in so the
example needs nothing outside itself; no decoder accepts it. A key is always the operator's to
provision at runtime (an environment variable or a `signing-key=<path>` file in the CLI), never
compiled in.

## Signing

`sign_atmos_stream` signs, in place, every syncframe in a stream that carries an EMDF object
container — frames without one are left untouched — and returns how many it signed.
`sign_atmos_frame` does the same for one syncframe at a time, returning true when that frame
carried a container and was signed. Scope is narrow: the ICL Forge "atmos" output (a single
independent 5.1 substream, frame-level exponent strategy and SNR, no coupling). A frame outside
that subset is left unsigned rather than signed wrong, the same answer a frame with no container
gets.

## Keys

`SigningKey` owns its bytes and zeroizes them on destruction, so a supplied key does not linger in
freed heap after signing finishes. `load_signing_key(explicit_path)` resolves one from, in order,
an explicit path, `$ICLFORGE_SIGNING_KEY_FILE`, then `$ICLFORGE_SIGNING_KEY` — the same resolution
the CLI's `signing-key=<path>` uses — and returns a `std::expected<SigningKey, KeyLoadError>`.
`KeyLoadError::kind` is one of `KeyErrorKind::kAbsent` (no source offered a key, which a caller
that did not ask to sign can treat as fine), `kUnreadable`, `kMalformed` or `kEmpty`.

`decode_signing_key` is the shared decode underneath all three. It tries base64 first (the
CI/secret-transport form: a GitHub secret is text and cannot carry a raw binary key), then a
comma- or whitespace-separated `0xHH` byte array (the shape a disassembler export has), then takes
the content as raw bytes. Content that is made up only of hex-array characters but parses as
neither of the first two returns `std::nullopt` rather than being taken as raw bytes, because a
truncated hex export used as a key would sign with the wrong secret without any error. Plain hex
without `0x` prefixes is not a separate format: it is valid base64, so the two cannot be told
apart.

## Verifying

`has_authenticity_tag(frame)` reports whether a syncframe carries a non-zero tag, without a key. A
true result says a tag is present, not that it is valid. `verify_atmos_frame(frame, key)` and
`verify_atmos_stream(stream, key)` recompute the tag over the same regions the signer authenticates
and compare it with what the frame holds, without modifying anything. A frame with no EMDF object
container has nothing to check, so the frame form returns a `VerifyResult` of `kNoContainer`,
`kValid` or `kMismatch`, and the stream form returns a `VerifySummary` of `valid`, `mismatch` and
`no_container` counts.

Verification checks a tag this signer wrote: it tests round trips, tampering with signed test
assets and delivery QC. It says nothing about whether a licensed decoder would accept the stream,
because that decoder's own check uses a key and scheme this library does not have. See
[Object signing](../concepts/object-signing.md).

A tag vouches for the container it covers, so a frame is `kValid` only when that container is the
whole of its object layer: a payload in another block's skip field or bytes trailing the container
are outside the tag, and a container with no primary protection field has no tag to match. Both
are `kMismatch`.

## Several keys

`verify_atmos_frame_any(frame, keys)` and `verify_atmos_stream_any(stream, keys)` take a
`std::span<const SigningKey>` and call a frame valid when any key reproduces its tag. The frame form
returns a `KeyringVerdict` (`result`, and `key_index` — the first accepting key — when `kValid`);
the stream form a `KeyringSummary` (`totals`, a `VerifySummary` whose `valid` means "under some
key", and `per_key`, how many frames each key accepted, summing to `totals.valid`). An empty key in
the list is skipped, and a list with no usable key accepts nothing — a frame that has a container
is a mismatch, never a pass. They are named apart from the single-key functions rather than
overloaded on a span, because `verify_atmos_frame(frame, {})` would otherwise be ambiguous.

## The licensed gate

`gate_atmos_stream(stream, keys)` returns the stream a licensed decoder would play: every frame
whose object layer verifies under some key is copied through byte for byte, and every other frame
has its object layer removed with `iclforge::ac3::io::strip_objects`'s own rewrite, so it plays as
its 5.1 bed — bit-identically, with no re-encode. The result is an `std::expected<GatedStream,
io::StripError>`: `GatedStream::bytes` and a `GateSummary` (`passed`, `gated`, `no_objects` and
`per_key`).

```cpp
const std::vector<iclforge::base::crypto::SigningKey> ring{key_2025, key_2026};
const auto gated = iclforge::ac3::signing::gate_atmos_stream(stream, ring);
if (gated) {
    // decode gated->bytes with any decoder: objects where the tag was good, the bed elsewhere
}
```

The gate fails closed. A frame with an object layer this build can neither verify nor remove (a
shape outside the frame walker's scope) is returned as the error (`kUnsupportedFrame`, ...), never
as a pass; a stream with no object layer at all is not an error and comes back unchanged. An
AC-3 syncframe cannot carry one and passes as it is. Like the verifier, the gate reaches the
frame shapes this project's encoder writes — a third-party DD+ JOC stream is outside what the
signer's walk maps, and is refused rather than guessed at.

## In the CLI

`atmos`, `atmos-path`, `atmos-encode` and `atmos-cbi` accept `sign-objects` and `signing-key=<path>`
(or the two environment variables above):

```bash
forge atmos-encode in.wav out.ec3 448 0 paths.json sign-objects signing-key=/path/to/key
```

`decode`, `monitor` and `spatial` accept `verify-objects`, which checks every frame against the key
and refuses the whole command on a mismatch, and `gate-objects`, which plays the objects of the
frames that verify and the bed of those that do not, and carries on. `signing-key=` repeats for
either, and a frame is good under any of the keys; `sign-objects` takes one. The two options
cannot be combined. `forge probe` reports whether an authenticity tag is present, with no key.
There is no CLI command that signs an existing stream after encoding.

Signing is E-AC-3 only: it protects the EMDF container of a DD+ JOC stream. AC-4 objects are not
signed, and both `sign-objects` with `codec=ac4` and `verify-objects` on an AC-4 stream are usage
errors.

## Provenance

The HMAC-SHA-256 construction (RFC 2104 / FIPS 180-4) and the choice of which frame regions are
authenticated are clean-room: derived from this codec's own public container layout
(`iclforge::emdf`, `ETSI TS 103 420`) and built on this project's own parsing primitives. The key is the
one piece never carried here, the same posture a licensed tool takes with its own (iLok-provisioned)
key.
