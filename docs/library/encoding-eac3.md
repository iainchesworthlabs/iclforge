# Encoding E-AC-3

## E-AC-3: `iclforge::ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder`

`iclforge/ac3/encoder/eac3_frame.hpp`. Same shape, different container. E-AC-3 is not an AC-3 variant:
no `crc1`, an arbitrary 11-bit `frmsiz` instead of a size table (so the 44.1 kHz padding
alternation disappears), exponent strategies planned per frame and written in whichever of Annex
E's two forms the plan needs (a Table E2.10 code per channel, or per-block), and a syncframe
that can carry fewer than six blocks.

```cpp
// Heap-allocated: FrameEncoder carries several KB of MDCT scratch/history
// state (PREfast's C6262).
auto encoder = std::make_unique<iclforge::ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder>(iclforge::ac3::eac3::FrameConfig{
    .bitrate_kbps = 192,
    .acmod = iclforge::ac3::Acmod::k2_0,
});

std::vector<std::vector<float>> pcm(2, std::vector<float>(iclforge::ac3::kSamplesPerFrame));
const auto views = views_of(pcm);

std::vector<std::byte> stream;
for (int frame = 0; frame < 31; ++frame) {
    fill_tones(pcm, tones, frame, 48000.0);
    const auto encoded = encoder->encode_frame(views);
    if (!encoded) {
        return 1;
    }
    stream.insert(stream.end(), encoded->begin(), encoded->end());
}
```

`FrameConfig` carries nearly everything `EncoderConfig` does, plus the Annex E tools. Three AC-3
fields do not carry over as they are: there is no `cplendf` — the coupling end frequency is derived
(the top of the coded spectrum, or from `spxbegf` when spectral extension is on, §E3.3.1) — no
`cmixlev`/`surmixlev`, which the `mixing` group below replaces, and no `alternate_bsi`, since
Annex D is AC-3 syntax.

`chbwcod` now behaves exactly as AC-3's does: −1, the default, asks the encoder to choose. It
used to default to a fixed 60 — the whole 23.7 kHz at every rate — on the reasoning that Annex
E's own tools take the high band over whenever the frame cannot afford it. They do, but only
below the per-channel rates at which `auto` turns them on (40 kbit/s for coupling in stereo,
56 for spectral extension), so a 192 kbit/s stereo stream ran neither and still coded every one
of the 253 mantissas. See [Coded bandwidth](encoding-ac3.md#coded-bandwidth) for what the
shared decision does.

One field widens instead: `FrameConfig::sample_rate` also accepts the three Annex E half rates —
`k24000`, `k22050`, `k16000` (24/22.05/16 kHz). For those the encoder writes `fscod2` in place
of `numblkscod` (§E2.3.1.3, the block count is then implicitly six), and the reduced rate reuses
its double-rate parent's bit-allocation tables (§E2.3.1.4). The CLI maps the plain rate numbers
onto them. Classic AC-3 has no `frmsizecod` row for a reduced rate, so `iclforge::ac3::FrameEncoder`
rejects them outright.

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `numblkscod` | `3` | §E2.3.1.4, Table E2.4: how many 256-sample blocks a syncframe carries — 0/1/2 give 1/2/3 blocks (5.3/10.7/16 ms), the default 3 gives the usual six (32 ms). Every substream of an access unit must agree (`AccessUnitEncoder`'s constructor refuses a mismatch). Below 3, Table E1.3 implies `expstre = 1` and `ahte = 0` — the frame-level (Table E2.10) exponent-strategy form and AHT are both unwritable, so requesting either together with a short `numblkscod` is refused by `validate()` rather than silently dropped. Not available at the three reduced rates, which spend `numblkscod`'s own bits on `fscod2` instead (see below) — `validate()` refuses that combination too. |
| `spx`, `spxbegf` | `false`, -1 | Spectral extension (§E3.6). Above the extension frequency nothing is coded: the decoder copies a lower band up, blends noise, and scales to a transmitted envelope. Cheaper and cruder than coupling, so the two stack. |
| `spx_atten`, `spxattencod` | `true`, -1 | The §E3.6.4.2.3 notch across the seam. Six bits per channel per frame. |
| `aht`, `gaqmod` | `false`, -1 | Adaptive hybrid transform (§E3.4): a second 6-point DCT down each bin across the frame's six blocks. Decided per channel per frame — setting the flag permits it, not forces it. |
| `coupling`, `cplbegf` | `false`, -1 | §E3.3. With `spx` also on, §E3.3.1 derives the coupling end frequency from `spxbegf`. |
| `enhanced` | `false` | §E3.5: enhanced coupling instead of standard — 22 sub-bands, amplitude/angle/chaos-quantized coordinates and a phase-restoring reconstruction built on a full DFT, rather than a single per-band scale factor. Only meaningful with `coupling` also set (`cpl+ecpl`); combines with `spx` the same way standard coupling does. This encoder fits real amplitude/angle coordinates per band (an exact 2-variable linear least squares, since §3.5.5.4's reconstruction is linear in the complex gain the pair expresses) and chooses chaos by searching its 8 legal codes against the decoder's own deterministic de-correlation sequence. Two different channels forced into one narrow coupling band still cost quality — a single coordinate per band has a real, structural limit on what it can separate — but it is no longer the amplitude-only fit's all-or-nothing loss. |
| `transient_prenoise` | `false` | §3.7 (`tpn`): a post-IMDCT correction that overwrites the pre-echo ahead of a detected transient with a synthesized copy of the clean audio just before it. Reuses the same transient detector block switching relies on, so it only has an effect on channels/frames that also block-switch. See [Decoding](decoding.md) for the 1536-sample decoder-side latency this introduces and the `flush()` call it requires. |
| `delta_allocation` | `true` | §7.2.2.6 delta bit allocation, as for AC-3: the corrections chosen per run and the second fit that weighs them. `false` skips both - the first level of the encoders' effort axis, measured on the ESP32-S3 page - and the stream has `dbaflde` clear. The CLI accepts the command-wide `delta=off` option; inside `eac3-encode`'s fourth positional `[tools]` argument, the spelling is `nodelta`, not `tools=nodelta`. |
| `fast_mdct` | `true` | The §7.9.4 fast N/4-FFT forward MDCT instead of the direct §8.2.3.2 evaluation — a performance choice, not a coding tool: nothing in the bitstream's syntax changes, only how the coefficients were computed (verified ~3e-12 max relative error against the direct form; 0.000 dB SNR delta against an independent oracle at 192–448 kbps). `false` forces the direct reference form, which stays maintained as the oracle the fast path is validated against — the CLI spells that `tools=nofastmdct`. All three forward transforms accelerate — the long one and both halves of a block-switched pair, each down its own independently-derived fold (`iclforge/ac3/core/mdct.hpp`), and `FrameConfig::fast_mdct` reaches all of them. |
| `fgaincod` | -1 | §7.2.2.4 fast gain, Table 7.11. -1 leaves Table E1.4's implied `0x4` and writes no `fgaincode` element; 0–7 pins the code, which opens that element in every block (132 bits a frame at 5.1 with coupling), where AC-3 carries the code on the `snroffst` element it sends anyway. `search` moves it as one of its two axes. |
| `dither` | `true` | §7.3.4 `dithflag`, decided per channel per block from content as for AC-3, except that a frame using spectral extension always dithers off; `false` pins it at 0. |
| `info` | none | `std::optional<meta::BsiInfo>`: the `infomdat` group (Table E1.2), the informational fields AC-3 carries in bsi — see [Bit stream information](metadata.md#bit-stream-information-iclforgeac3metabsihpp). |
| `search` | `kNone` | Per-frame search over §7.2.2's transmitted bit-allocation parameters against `iclforge::ac3::quality`'s decoded-domain distortion, instead of the fixed `dbpbcod` 3 that an earlier sweep measured its way to on average. CBR only (`FrameConfig::vbr` unset) - silently inert under VBR/ABR, the same documented boundary the encoder already draws around AHT streams, not a rejected configuration. `kDistortion` only: `kPerceptual` is accepted but inert too, on the same grounds [Decision search](encoding-ac3.md#decision-search) already found it for AC-3. Two axes, the same pair AC-3's search moves: `dbpbcod` over `{kAllocCodes' 3, Table E1.4's 2}`, and `fgaincod` over `iclforge::ac3::rate_adaptive_fgaincod`'s measured code plus §8.2.12's own default. Unlike AC-3's, the `fgaincod` candidates are not free - `baie` carries no fast gain, so a non-default code opens the per-block `fgaincode` element (`frmfgaincode` 1) and buys its masking curve out of the mantissa budget - so each candidate is scored after a refit against its own side-info cost rather than against the incumbent's. Measured on real CC0 stereo material at 96-640 kbit/s, `dbpbcod` alone was negligible everywhere tried, which is what this axis was added to move. CLI: `search=distortion`/`search=perceptual`/`search=off`. |
| `mixing` | none | The `mixmdate` group (Table E1.2). E-AC-3 dropped `cmixlev`/`surmixlev` from `bsi` entirely, so without this the stream carries no downmix levels at all. |
| `strmtyp`, `substreamid`, `chanmap`, `last_dependent` | independent, 0, none, false | Substream identity. Set by `AccessUnitEncoder`; you rarely touch these directly. |
| `oba_complexity_index` | none | TS 103 420 §8.3 object count in `addbsi`. This is the marker FFmpeg keys its "Dolby Digital Plus + Dolby Atmos" report off. |

## How `auto` chooses

`FrameConfig::auto_tools` (the CLI's `tools=auto`) hands the tool set to the encoder instead of
naming it. It overrides `coupling`/`spx`/`aht` rather than combining with them: when it is set
they are not read at all, while `cplbegf`/`spxbegf`/`gaqmod` still steer the geometry of whatever
it does turn on.

It decides from two things — the per-channel bitrate, and the frame itself. The content half is
measured from the MDCT coefficients the transform has already produced, so it costs a pass over
the affected region and no second transform:

| Measure | What it is | What it decides |
|---|---|---|
| coupling fit | How much of the coupling region's energy survives the decoder's own reconstruction of it. §7.4.1's shared channel is the coefficient sum and the transmitted coordinate restores each band's energy, so the residual against that rank-one shape is what coupling costs — this is evaluated, not estimated. 1.0 is a perfect fit (every channel already a scalar multiple of the sum, which is what near-mono material looks like above 8 kHz); independent channels of equal level land at `2/sqrt(n) - 1`, which is 0.41 for a stereo pair and slightly negative for five. | Whether to couple, and how far above the fixed rate ceiling coupling may reach. |
| extension energy share | How much of the frame's energy sits above the extension frequency. | Whether to extend: the ceiling runs from 110 kbit/s per channel where the top end is nearly empty down to 55 where it carries real content. |

The rules that fall out of those:

- **Spectral extension** is on below a ceiling that moves with the energy share above. A frame
  whose top end is nearly empty — which is most real programme material — gets synthesis at up to
  96 kbit/s per channel, because what synthesis replaces there is a band the coder was about to
  spend nothing on and drop. A frame whose top end carries real content loses it by 64.
- **Coupling** needs a fit of 0.99 or better *and* a region at least four sub-bands wide.
  §E3.3.1 derives `cplendf` from `spxbegf`, so wherever synthesis is in use coupling is left one
  or two sub-bands — 12 or 24 coefficients — which cannot repay a coordinate per band per channel
  plus a shared channel the allocator buys bits for. In practice `auto` now couples rarely.
- **AHT** is always permitted and decided per channel per frame by whether the six blocks look
  alike, which was already a content decision.
- **Enhanced coupling** and **transient pre-noise processing** are never chosen by `auto` — see
  [What `auto` will not choose](#what-auto-will-not-choose) below.

Under VBR there is no fixed target rate, so `VbrConfig::nominal_kbps` (or `max_kbps`, or 192)
stands in for it. The content half is unaffected: it reads the frame either way, which is most of
what makes the VBR case work at all.

### What `auto` will not choose

Both of these are fully implemented, decode correctly in this project's own decoder at every
layout, and have their own CI legs. Neither is in `auto`'s set, for different reasons.

**Enhanced coupling (§E3.5)** is not a quality problem. Measured on real programme material —
six 12 s excerpts of a 5.1 theatrical mix at six (layout, rate) points — it scores *above*
standard coupling on ViSQOL MOS-LQO at every one of them: +0.54 MOS-LQO at 96 kbit/s stereo, +0.31 at 128 and +0.18 at 192, and +0.78 / +0.55 / +0.16 at 192 / 256 / 384 kbit/s 5.1. Every SNR trend
row records it as a loss, and both are true: a phase-restoring reconstruction built on a full DFT
does not preserve the waveform, it preserves what the waveform sounded like. (Against `auto`'s
own set the margin is smaller — once spectral extension is chosen properly it has already taken
most of the band coupling would have worked on — which is a reason to read the two coupling
reconstructions against each other rather than against the whole tool set.)

What rules it out is interoperability. FFmpeg's Annex E parser has no model of §E3.5's syntax at
all — it does not decline an enhanced-coupling stream, it misreads it and reports a corrupt
frame — and `auto` is the tool set a caller gets for asking for nothing in particular, so it has
to stay decodable by the decoders that exist. `cpl+ecpl` still asks for it explicitly, and on a
closed pipeline with a decoder known to read it, the measurements say to.

**Transient pre-noise processing (§3.7)** does not pay at all, and the measurement is
unambiguous. It overwrites the decoded audio ahead of a transient with a copy of the audio 512
samples earlier. That substitution's error is a property of the material, not of the coder: over
exactly the samples it touches it measures 20.7–22.5 dB at every bitrate tried, flat. The coder's
own error over those same samples is 11.9 dB at 96 kbit/s stereo and −3.3 dB at 256 — it improves
with rate, and it is already the better of the two at the lowest rate this encoder supports. So
the correction lands between 6.5 and 24 dB *worse* than leaving the audio alone, everywhere it
fires, and the gap widens as the rate rises. It is not a bit-allocation effect: outside its own
footprint the two decodes are bit-identical. Perceptually it is a no-op — MOS-LQO matched the
untreated encode to within 0.01 in every row measured.

These figures predate a decoder fix: the decoder then applied each correction one block (256
samples) ahead of where A/52 and Dolby's own decoder apply it, so what was measured is a
correction over the clean audio before the pre-noise rather than over the pre-noise itself. Where
it lands now, `tools/ci/quality_race.py`'s own-decoder rows score the stereo stream at 192 kbit/s
2.1 dB closer to its source than they did (26.2 against 24.0 dB) and the 5.1 stream at 256
kbit/s 0.1 dB closer. The comparison above has not been repeated.

The mechanism is that block switching gets there first. §3.7 exists to clean up pre-echo, and
this encoder gates the correction on the same transient detector that switches to short
transforms — so it fires exactly where the short transforms have already confined the pre-echo,
and substitutes earlier audio for audio that was not damaged. Treat it as a reference-correctness
tool: it demonstrates the syntax and the §3.7.2 reconstruction, and there is no measured rate or
content at which it improves the result.


Block switching (§8.2.2/§7.9) is automatic here too — no config field. A channel that switches
anywhere in the frame is excluded from both coupling (same reasoning as AC-3's) and, for this
generation only, from AHT for that frame: AHT's own "stationary" premise (§E3.4, the opposite of
what triggered the switch) already selects against a switching channel most of the time, but the
exclusion is explicit rather than relying on that correlation.

Rematrixing (§7.5.3) is automatic too, `acmod` 2/0 only, no config field — the same minimum-power
decision AC-3's own encoder makes (see [Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md#rematrixing)), over the same Table 7.25
bands. Annex E §3.3's "Modifications to Previously Defined Parameters" only changes how many of
those bands are active (`nrematbd`, accounting for coupling, enhanced coupling and spectral
extension all separately taking over the top of the spectrum) — the boundaries and the decision
rule are untouched, so nothing here needed reinventing beyond that band count and clamping the
last active band to wherever this channel's own coding actually stops.

The bit allocation parameters are transmitted rather than inherited (`bamode` 1). Table E1.4's
own `bamode == 0` defaults are not §8.2.12's basic-encoder set — most of the two agree, but
`floorcod` is 0x7 against §8.2.12's 4 — so "inherit" was never the same thing as "what AC-3
does". Sending them costs `baie` plus eleven bits in block 0 and one bit in each of the other
five, 17 a frame; it buys `dbpbcod` 3, the one departure the AC-3 encoder measured its way to
(see [Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md)), which lifts the masking curve over bands quieter than
`dbknee` and sends their bits to bands that hold energy. `floorcod` stays at 0x7: it is the
lowest of the eight and never binds, which the same sweep confirmed here as it had for AC-3.

Dither substitution (§7.3.4) works exactly as it does on AC-3 — see
[Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md#dither-substitution) for the rule — with `dithflage` set so the
per-channel flags are transmitted rather than defaulting to on. One narrowing is specific to this
generation: dither is held off entirely for any frame that uses spectral extension. The encoder
holds a reconstruction of what the decoder will produce there, because the extension bands are
scaled to match the copy source's own energy, and the decoder's dither values are not
reproducible from the encoder's side — the sequence a bin receives depends on how many zero-bit
bins the decoder walked before it, across every stream and block. Rather than shadow that
traversal order, the tool that would disturb it is switched off. An AHT channel is left out of
the judgement too: its zero-`hebap` bins reconstruct as literal zero whatever the flag says.

`FrameConfig::dialnorm2` (see "Dual mono" in [Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md)) works exactly
the same way here: set it alongside `dialnorm` when `acmod` is `kDualMono`. Dual mono is always a
lone independent substream with no dependents — 1+1 has no bed/dependent split to make — so
`AccessUnitEncoder` gives Ch2 its own `RangeController`/`HeavyCompressor` too, measured on the
independent substream's own two channels the same way it measures Ch1's. It has no VBR
implications either: dual mono is orthogonal to CBR/VBR, since `vbr` only changes how the frame's
*size* is decided, not how many programmes it carries.

## Variable bit rate: `FrameConfig::vbr`

E-AC-3's `frmsiz` states the frame's word count directly rather than indexing a table, so unlike
AC-3 a frame is free to be a different size than the one before it. Setting `vbr` switches a
`FrameConfig` from CBR (size fixed from `bitrate_kbps`) to VBR (size follows the content, at a
chosen quality):

```cpp
iclforge::ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder encoder{{
    .bitrate_kbps = 192,  // not read once vbr is set — see below
    .acmod = iclforge::ac3::Acmod::k2_0,
    .vbr = iclforge::ac3::eac3::VbrConfig{
        .quality = 0.4,
        .max_kbps = 320,  // optional ceiling
    },
}};
```

| `VbrConfig` field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `quality` | `0.5` | `[0, 1]`, linearly maps onto the encoder's own SNR-offset search space. Encoder-relative, not a perceptual scale — and **not linear in bit cost**: cost rises steeply in roughly the top third of the range, so a high quality with no `max_kbps` bound will often refuse ordinary multi-channel material outright (`FrameError::kInvalidBitrate`) rather than produce an oversized frame. **Not read at all when `abr` is set** — see below. |
| `min_kbps`, `max_kbps` | none, none | Optional hard bounds, same unit as `bitrate_kbps`. When the quality target would need more words than `max_kbps` allows, the encoder falls back to the same search CBR uses, budgeted against the ceiling — so a bounded VBR frame is never worse than the best CBR could do at that rate. `min_kbps` is a pure floor: `finish_frame`'s own padding covers the gap. They bound each individual frame, so they compose with `abr` rather than competing with it. |
| `nominal_kbps` | none | Drives the `cplbegf`/`spxbegf` frequency defaults in place of a fixed target rate. Unset it resolves to `abr->target_kbps` if there is one, then `max_kbps` if set, else `kVbrDefaultNominalKbps` (192) — under ABR the contracted average is the stand-in, where `max_kbps` is only the ceiling one frame may peak to. A caller who wants today's CBR tool behaviour at some quality supplies the same number they would have passed as `bitrate_kbps`. |
| `abr` | none | `std::optional<AbrConfig>`. Holds a long-run **average** rate while each frame's size still moves with the content — what a streaming ladder rung or a DVB mux contracts for, and what neither CBR nor free-running VBR delivers. See below. |

`bitrate_kbps` itself is not read on the encode path at all once `vbr` is set.

### Average bit rate: `AbrConfig`

Set `VbrConfig::abr` and the encoder holds one composite SNR offset across frames and steers it —
up while the stream is running under its target, down while it is running over — so a quiet frame
stays cheap and a busy one is allowed to cost more, with the average landing where it was asked
to. Underneath that, `window_frames` consecutive frames pool one budget as a hard ceiling, so no
window can overrun whatever the offset is doing.

| `AbrConfig` field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `target_kbps` | 192 | The long-run average, same unit and meaning as `bitrate_kbps`. |
| `window_frames` | 32 | How many consecutive frames share one pooled budget. At 48 kHz a six-block frame is 32 ms, so the default holds the average over about a second — long enough for a bar of music or a spoken phrase to borrow from its neighbours, short enough that a mux's own buffer model still recognises the result. `1` pools nothing, which pins every frame to one frame's share and makes ABR behave as CBR; `0` is refused by `validate()`. |

`quality` is not read under ABR at all: the two are different rate controls — `quality` fixes the
offset, ABR's whole job is to move it — and the stream's first frame seeds the offset from its own
budget search rather than from a number a caller guessed.

`AccessUnitConfig` needs no separate VBR field: each substream's own `FrameConfig::vbr` carries
what it needs, and `plan::eac3_config()` shares one `VbrConfig` across every substream of a
`plan::Plan`, halving `min_kbps`/`max_kbps`/`nominal_kbps`/`abr->target_kbps` for dependents the
same way it already halves `bitrate_kbps` — substreams occupy one frame period, not one frame.
`abr->window_frames` is a count of frames rather than a rate, so it carries over unchanged.

Silent frames (`build_silent_frame`) and AC-3 (`plan::Codec::kAc3`) both reject a `vbr` config
outright: silence has no content to size a quality target against, and AC-3's `frmsizecod` has no
free word count to vary in the first place.

## Wide layouts: `iclforge::ac3::eac3::AccessUnitEncoder`

Anything past 5.1 rides in *dependent substreams* beside a self-sufficient 5.1 bed. Every
substream codes the same 1536 samples of the same programme; a dependent contributes only its
own channels, its `chanmap`, and its share of the bit rate.

```cpp
// The bed is self-sufficient: a decoder that reads only the independent
// substream gets a complete 5.1 programme.
iclforge::ac3::eac3::AccessUnitConfig config;
config.independent = {
    .bitrate_kbps = 384,
    .acmod = iclforge::ac3::Acmod::k3_2,
    .lfe = true,
};
// Each dependent gets its own slice of the rate — substreams share a frame
// period, not a frame — and a Table E2.5 chanmap naming where its channels
// belong. Per §E3.8.2 the locations that collide with the bed replace it
// and the rest extend the layout.
config.dependents.push_back({
    .bitrate_kbps = 192,
    .acmod = iclforge::ac3::Acmod::k2_2,
    .chanmap = iclforge::ac3::eac3::chanmap::k71Rear,  // Ls, Rs, Lrs, Rrs
});
config.dependents.push_back({
    .bitrate_kbps = 192,
    .acmod = iclforge::ac3::Acmod::k2_2,
    .chanmap = iclforge::ac3::eac3::chanmap::kTopQuad,  // Vhl, Vhr, Lts, Rts
});

iclforge::ac3::eac3::AccessUnitEncoder encoder{config};
```

Channels are grouped by substream in transmission order: the independent's first in Table 5.8
order with LFE last, then each dependent's in the order its `chanmap` names them.
`encoder.channel_count()` is the total, and the span count `encode_access_unit` expects.

```cpp
const auto unit = encoder.encode_access_unit(views);
// unit->bytes is the wire order already; substream_bytes records the
// per-substream boundaries, which crc2 is computed over.
stream.insert(stream.end(), unit->bytes.begin(), unit->bytes.end());
```

Full program: [`examples/encode_eac3.cpp`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/examples/encode_eac3.cpp).

Constraints: at most 8 dependents; a dependent may not disagree with its parent on sample
rate; and the locations a `chanmap` names must add up to the channels its `acmod` and `lfeon`
actually code, or you get `FrameError::kInvalidChannelMap`. A single dependent codes at most 5
full-bandwidth channels, which is why 7.1.4 — six channels beyond the bed — needs two.

Useful `chanmap` constants (`iclforge/ac3/core/eac3_tables.hpp`, Table E2.5):

| Constant | Channels | Gives you |
|---|---|---|
| `k71Rear` | Ls, Rs, Lrs, Rrs | 7.1 (the surrounds replace the bed's, the rears are new) |
| `k512Height` | Vhl, Vhr | 5.1.2 |
| `kTopQuad` | Vhl, Vhr, Lts, Rts | 5.1.4 |
| `k71Rear` + `kTopQuad` | both of the above | 7.1.4, in two dependents |

`chanmap::expand(map)` turns a map into a `Layout` you can iterate, and `chanmap::name`
gives each location's short name.

## Latency

The four terms and what each one means are set out in
[the AC-3 page's Latency section](encoding-ac3.md#latency); everything there applies here too,
because E-AC-3 uses the same transform, the same default frame length and the same
lookahead-free block-switch decision. What differs is one tool, one shape and one option.

**`transient_prenoise` costs 1536 samples of decoder hold-back.** §3.7's correction reaches
across frame boundaries — back up to 1528 samples from a transient that may itself lie in a later
frame — so a decoder can only realize it while it still holds that much audio, which at six blocks
a syncframe means returning frame N−1's PCM from the call that supplies frame N. That is 1536
samples whatever the syncframe length, permanently, from the first frame that actually uses the
tool onward:

```cpp
iclforge::ac3::eac3::FrameConfig config{.bitrate_kbps = 448, .acmod = iclforge::ac3::Acmod::k3_2, .lfe = true};
config.transient_prenoise = true;
iclforge::ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder encoder{config};
encoder.latency_samples();  // 3328 = 1536 frame + 256 transform + 1536 hold-back
```

`eac3::eac3_latency(config)` answers the same question without building an encoder, which is
what a pipeline sizing its buffers up front actually needs. Every *other* Annex E tool — AHT,
coupling, enhanced coupling, spectral extension — is a different way of coding the same frame's
coefficients and adds nothing: AHT packs a channel's six blocks into block 0 rather than looking
ahead of the frame, and spx and coupling reconstruct within the block they arrive in.

The hold-back engages when the tool does, not when it is configured. This encoder reuses the
`blksw` decision rather than running a second detector, so a stream that never block-switches
never sets `transproce` and never holds anything back — `Eac3Decoder::latency_samples()` reports
0 until it does, and 1536 from then on.

**An access unit's budget is the worst of its substreams'.** Every substream codes the same 1536
samples of the same program, so the frame and transform terms are shared rather than summed; the
hold-back is per-substream, and `decode_access_unit` cannot assemble a program until its slowest
substream has released. `AccessUnitEncoder::latency()` reports that.

### Short syncframes (`numblkscod` 0–2)

Annex E §E2.3.1.4 allows a syncframe to carry 1, 2 or 3 blocks instead of 6, and
`FrameConfig::numblkscod` selects it on the encode side as well as the decode
side. Framing is by far the biggest latency term, so this is the largest single reduction
available: a shorter syncframe is a shorter *frame*, and `encode_frame` then wants
`samples_per_frame()` samples per channel — 256, 512 or 768 — rather than the 1536 a six-block
frame takes. What it costs is the whole `bsi`/`audfrm` header repeated that much more often,
which at a fixed bit rate comes straight out of the mantissas, plus the Table E1.3 shortcuts the
`numblkscod` row in the `FrameConfig` table above sets out (`expstre` implied 1, `ahte` implied
0, both refused by `validate()` rather than silently dropped).

**`eac3_latency()` counts it.** `LatencyBudget::frame_samples` is `samples_per_frame()` — 256,
512, 768 or 1536 — so `latency_samples()` on a one-block configuration is 512 (256 of frame and
256 of transform), and 768, 1024 and 1792 for two, three and six blocks. The hold-back does not
shrink with the syncframe: it is 1536 samples whatever the length, six one-block syncframes where
a six-block configuration holds one (`libs/ac3/tests/decoder/test_latency.cpp` pins both).

## More than one programme

Dependent substreams widen *one* programme. §E2.3.1.2 also allows up to eight **independent**
substreams (I0–I7) in one elementary stream, and that is a different thing entirely: each is a
self-sufficient programme with its own layout, rate and metadata, and a receiver plays one of
them. Broadcast DD+ uses it for the services A/52 §5.4.2.2 names — a second language, an audio
description, a commentary.

`AccessUnitConfig::additional` carries them. `independent`/`dependents` stay the first
programme; each entry of `additional` is a `ProgrammeConfig` with an independent substream and
dependents of its own.

```cpp
iclforge::ac3::eac3::AccessUnitConfig config;
config.independent = {.bitrate_kbps = 448, .acmod = iclforge::ac3::Acmod::k3_2,
                      .lfe = true, .dialnorm = 27};
// I1: a mono commentary, levelled independently of the mix it plays against.
config.additional.push_back({.independent = {.bitrate_kbps = 96,
                                             .acmod = iclforge::ac3::Acmod::k1_0,
                                             .dialnorm = 20}});
```

`substreamid` is assigned by position — the first programme is I0, `additional[0]` is I1 — the
same way a dependent's id comes from its position in `dependents`; `FrameConfig::substreamid` is
not read.

`encode_access_unit` takes every programme's channels in one call, the first programme's first,
in the same order the substreams go on the wire. Rates add rather than divide: substreams share
a frame period, not a frame, so `access_unit_words` is the sum across every programme.

Each programme keeps its own §7.7 measurement — its own `RangeController`/`HeavyCompressor`,
measured on its own independent substream — because dialnorm and DRC are properties of a
programme. Sharing one measurement across two would level a commentary by the main mix. Per
programme, too: the §E3.8.2 16-channel cap, and the metadata a `FrameConfig` carries.

A programme with dependents (`ProgrammeConfig::dependents`, or the top-level `dependents` above)
gets a second, independent `HeavyCompressor` when `heavy` is set: §E3.8.5 gives the LAST
dependent's `compr` to the whole programme, so that word has to answer for every rendered
channel, not the independent substream's own five — `AccessUnitEncoder` measures it from the
complete rendered programme, folded the way `iclforge::ac3::OutputStage`'s rendered-layout overload seats a
wide layout (see [Decoding](decoding.md#the-output-stage)). The independent's own word, from its
own channels alone, still goes out too, for a receiver that decodes only the 5.1 bed.

Constraints: at most 8 programmes; every substream of every programme must agree on the sample
rate, since they all code the same frame period. An Atmos EMDF container still rides in the last
substream of the **first** programme (TS 103 420 §8.2) — the objects belong to a programme, so a
later programme's substreams are never it.

The CLI authors up to seven further programmes with `programme2=<file>` through `programme8=<file>`,
each with its own `programmeN-layout=`, `programmeN-bitrate=` and the rest of the primary
programme's own metadata keys via `programmeN-<field>=` (dialnorm, bsmod, the whole mixmdate
group); see [docs/forge/cli/metadata-options.md](../forge/cli/metadata-options.md).

One caveat worth knowing before you ship such a stream: **FFmpeg cannot read it at all**, and not
just the second programme — see
[docs/verification.md](../verification.md#where-the-oracles-dont-reach).
