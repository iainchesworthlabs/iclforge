# macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel, Homebrew LLVM)

!!! note "Verified in CI only — no Mac host is available to this project"
    There is no macOS host available to this project locally; everything on this page has been
    exercised exclusively by two CI legs: `macos-llvm`, on GitHub's `macos-latest` (Apple
    Silicon) runners, configuring the `config-macos-llvm` / `config-macos-llvm-debug` preset pair,
    and `macos-llvm-x64`, on GitHub's `macos-15-intel` runners (real native Intel hardware, not
    Rosetta emulation — confirmed against
    [docs.github.com's hosted-runner reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners)),
    configuring `config-macos-llvm-x64` / `config-macos-llvm-x64-debug`. The Apple Silicon leg
    runs in the run after a merge to main and the Intel leg in the nightly run; a release builds
    both. Neither is experimental any more. `macos-llvm`'s first-ever run surfaced one
    fully-understood issue (Homebrew's unpinned `llvm` formula flagging Catch2's `__COUNTER__`
    usage under `-Wc2y-extensions` — see `cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake`), fixed in one commit,
    followed by two consecutive clean runs. `macos-llvm-x64` (the Intel leg that the universal package needs, on a
    `macos-15-intel` runner label this project had not used before) went three
    consecutive clean runs — two `release.yml` dry runs and a feature branch's own PR CI — with
    gold-reference SNR numbers (67.80/67.82/67.76 dB, matching the x86 baseline every other
    non-arm64 leg reports) before its own `continue-on-error` escape hatch came off the same way
    (see [`.github/workflows/_build.yml`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/.github/workflows/_build.yml)).
    A red leg now opens the `main-red` or `main-red-nightly` issue, as any other
    non-experimental leg does ([CI for many agents](../ci-agentic.md#after-the-merge)).

    **One section of this page rests on less than that.**
    [Per-application capture](#per-application-capture-the-core-audio-process-tap) describes code
    that both legs compile and no Mac has run: a tap has been created exactly once, on a runner,
    where the call after it never returned. That section says what each part rests on and what
    that one run settled.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| What runs here | The library, `forge` and `forge-gui`. Hearth's window builds, and Crucible's macOS half compiles and its suites run |
| Build | Two CI legs, Apple Silicon after each merge and native Intel nightly; neither is experimental |
| Minimum OS | macOS 13.3 (Ventura): the deployment target `cmake/toolchains/macos.llvm.toolchain.cmake` sets for C++23 libc++ features, which the Homebrew cask also requires. The Core Audio process tap needs 14.2 |
| Sound | **Nothing on macOS has captured or played anything.** No Mac host is available to this project. A hosted runner has a virtual output device (`Apple Virtual Sound Device`) and a window session, but no audio hardware and no way to grant a consent prompt |
| Core Audio process tap | Written, compiled, **never created at runtime** |
| Crucible | Compiles and is exercised by the CI suites; the application has never been launched on a Mac |
| AC-4 | Decoded and encoded by `forge` and `forge-gui` in the same code the other platforms run. Core Audio defines no AC-4 format, so AC-4 can reach an output only as decoded PCM, and nothing on macOS has played a sound. v0.10.0-beta.1, the latest release, predates the AC-4 decoder and encoder |
| Packaging | A universal `.dmg` carrying `forge` and `forge-gui`, a Homebrew cask for the GUI and a source formula for the CLI; the cask has not been installed end to end on a Mac. Hearth and Crucible are in no macOS release package |

The two build variants feed one universal end-user package. Entries marked **Source** or
**In development** remain unconfirmed for sound hardware.

## Toolchain

Homebrew-installed LLVM (`cmake/toolchains/macos.llvm.toolchain.cmake` prefers it over Apple's
bundled clang), on the `arm64-macos-llvm` (Apple Silicon) or `x64-macos-llvm` (Intel) vcpkg
triplet — the toolchain file itself needed no change to support the second architecture; it
already resolved its target from `VCPKG_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE`, falling back to `uname -m` outside a
vcpkg port-build context. Unlike the Linux/Windows LLVM legs, neither is pinned to an exact
version: Homebrew's core `llvm` formula has no versioned sibling to pin against the way
`apt.llvm.org` or the official Windows installer do, so CI installs and reports whatever Homebrew
currently ships rather than asserting a specific one.

## Universal binaries

A release's macOS package is a single **universal (arm64 + x86_64) `.dmg`**, not two per-arch
ones. `macos-llvm` and `macos-llvm-x64` each build and `cmake --install` their own single-arch
tree; a separate `package-macos-universal` job (also CI-only — it runs on `macos-latest`, any
macOS label works since `lipo`/`hdiutil` are the only tools it needs) `lipo -create`s every
Mach-O file the two trees have in common — `forge`, `forge-gui`, and every dylib/framework binary
`qt_generate_deploy_qml_app_script` copies into `forge-gui.app/Contents/Frameworks/` — and packages
the merged tree with `hdiutil` directly, the same call CPack's own DragNDrop generator makes under
the hood. Proven for real in CI: `lipo -info` on the merged `forge`/`forge-gui` binaries and at
least one bundled Qt framework binary reports both `x86_64` and `arm64` present in the same file —
see that job's own log, not just its exit code. This was a deliberate reversal of the original
earlier plan, which called a macOS universal binary "a separate decision, not a given" on the
assumption that Intel demand was doubtful and no Intel hosted runner existed; `macos-15-intel`
turned out to already exist, be free for public repos, and be real native hardware rather than
Rosetta, which removed the actual blocker (needing to cross-compile x86_64 from Apple Silicon, or
pay for a self-hosted Intel Mac) entirely.

Each leg's own single-arch `.dmg` still exists as a packaging smoke test (`packageable: true`
never went away; the nightly run does it, since the run after a merge leaves that pass out), it
just isn't what a release publishes any more — see [Packaging](#packaging) below and
[docs/releasing.md](../releasing.md#what-gets-published). The two install trees the universal
job merges are the `runtime` component only, `forge` and `forge-gui`, so the release `.dmg` carries
neither Hearth nor Crucible. v0.10.0-beta.1 (2026-09-01) is the first release built by that job.

## Audio backend: CoreAudio

`libs/audio/CMakeLists.txt` selects a real CoreAudio backend on macOS, `libs/audio/src/backend/macos/`
— capture, monitor playback and IEC 61937 passthrough are built on the Audio HAL
(`AudioObjectID`/`AudioDeviceIOProc`), the same layer WASAPI and ALSA occupy on their own
platforms, rather than the no-backend stub that used to fall back to here. Its passthrough
mechanism differs from both: CoreAudio has no per-open bitstream flag the way
WASAPI's exclusive-mode subformat or ALSA's channel-status device name are, so bitstreaming means
taking hog mode on a digital output and retuning its *physical* stream format
(`kAudioStreamPropertyPhysicalFormat`) to `kAudioFormat60958AC3` for AC-3 — see
`libs/audio/src/backend/macos/passthrough.cpp`'s own header for the full mechanism, cross-checked
against three independent real-world implementations of the same thing (MythTV, mpv, VLC) while
writing it, since there was no Mac available locally to try it on directly. For E-AC-3, the same
walk additionally probes a stream's available physical formats for `kAudioFormatEnhancedAC3`:
Apple's own documentation confirms Dolby Digital Plus/Atmos HDMI passthrough exists on Apple
Silicon Macs without documenting the HAL mechanism behind it, so where a driver doesn't publish
that format (older hardware, a non-HDMI output, an Intel Mac) the backend reports E-AC-3
passthrough unavailable rather than claiming it everywhere — see `passthrough.cpp`'s own "AC-3
and E-AC-3" section.

AC-4 (IEC 61937-14) cannot go this way at all: retuning a stream needs a format ID for the codec,
and Core Audio's (`CoreAudioBaseTypes.h`) include none for AC-4. `PassthroughSink` refuses AC-4
with `kUnsupportedFormat`, and `supports_ac4_passthrough` is false on every device.

Passthrough **capture** — an input carrying somebody else's bitstream — needs none of that
machinery, on macOS or anywhere else: IEC 61937 bursts arrive as ordinary PCM samples, and
recognising them is `iclforge::containers::iec61937::PassthroughDetector`, which works off whatever interleaved
floats the backend delivers rather than off any HAL property. `forge record` uses it to write
the elementary stream instead of encoding the bursts as audio, `forge live` to stop rather than
encode a session of noise, and `forge unspdif` does the same job on a capture already saved to
disk. That part is platform-independent and shares the verification the framing has — see
[Windows](windows.md#passthrough-capture) for what is and is not confirmed.

The backend is CI-verified only: the parts that need no live device — enumeration on a machine
with none, format matching, sample conversion — run under `iclforge-audio-tests` on the hosted runner, same
as everywhere else without hardware, but no Mac has ever run this code against a digital
output, and no receiver has been asked to lock onto its output.

**No EDID/ELD backend here either.** `forge play` asks a chosen sink what it
actually accepts before committing to a format (see
[CLI → Following the sink](../forge/cli/commands.md#following-the-sink)), and that read
(`iclforge::audio::sink_capabilities`) exists today for ALSA and for PipeWire (see
[Linux](linux.md#reading-a-sinks-own-edideld)). CoreAudio's device properties and
IOKit's `IODisplayEDID` exist here, but neither is documented to expose the CEA-861
Short Audio Descriptor block for an HDMI *audio* endpoint specifically, and a pure optical
output has no display EDID to read in the first place. `play` falls back to the live
`enumerate_render_devices()` probe here, the same as before.

## Per-application capture: the Core Audio process tap

`forge devices` never lists a loopback entry here, and the capture class refuses
`DeviceKind::kLoopback` outright rather than silently opening a microphone instead — unlike
[Windows](windows.md) (any render endpoint reopened via WASAPI loopback) or
[Linux/PipeWire](linux.md#audio-backend-alsa-or-pipewire) (a sink's monitor), the Audio HAL this
backend otherwise uses has no "capture what a render device is playing" concept at all.

What macOS 14.2 (Sonoma) added instead is the per-*process* tap, and
`Capture::start_process_loopback(pid, mode, format)` is built on it:
`AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap` over a `CATapDescription`, carried by a private aggregate device
whose `AudioDeviceIOProcID` reads the way an input device's does. Because `CATapDescription` is an
Objective-C class with no C entry point, `libs/audio/src/backend/macos/process_tap.mm` is the
library's one Objective-C++ translation unit, behind the plain-C++ header `process_tap.hpp` that
the rest of the backend includes; `libs/audio/CMakeLists.txt`'s `APPLE` block enables `OBJCXX` for
that one file.

The tree holds **three `.mm` files and two directories that enable `OBJCXX`**. The other two are
Crucible's, for AppKit rather than Core Audio — `apps/crucible/engine/src/platform/macos/foreground.mm`
(NSWorkspace) and `apps/crucible/ui/src/platform/macos/app_icon_provider.mm` (NSWorkspace and NSImage)
— and `apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt`'s `APPLE` arm makes its own `enable_language(OBJCXX)` call
rather than relying on this one. Both call sites pin `CMAKE_OBJCXX_COMPILER` to the C++ compiler
the toolchain file chose, and `cmake/toolchains/macos.llvm.toolchain.cmake` sets
`CMAKE_OBJCXX_FLAGS_INIT` beside `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT` so a `.mm` resolves the standard library
headers to the same libc++ its neighbours use.

The tap is created with `muteBehavior = CATapMutedWhenTapped`, and that single choice is why
[Crucible](../crucible/index.md) needs no silent device on this platform. On Windows an
application's audio has to be sent to an installed silent driver, and on Linux to a PipeWire node
created at run time, so that the sound reaches the mixer instead of the speakers; here the mute
rides on the tap itself. Nothing in the sound settings changes and there is nothing to restore on
quit.

It also makes an open tap something Crucible has to be careful about holding. Its engine opens no
tap while its output stage has no endpoint, and releases any it holds when one goes away
(`Impl::sync_taps()` in `apps/crucible/engine/src/engine.cpp`), so a Mac where the output policy finds
nothing usable is not one where every application it listed falls silent. The same code runs on
Windows and Linux, where a tap mutes nothing and the rule costs nothing.

**Three ways this contract is narrower than the Windows one**, all of them properties of the API
rather than shortcuts:

- **One process, not a tree.** `ProcessLoopbackMode::kIncludeProcessTree` is honoured as "this
  process" and `kExcludeProcessTree` as "everything except this process". Windows' activation
  walks the target's children because a browser renders its audio from a utility process; a
  `CATapDescription` names audio process objects, which carry no descendant relation to follow.
  PipeWire's tap has the same property for its own reason, so Windows is the only one of the
  three backends with a tap where that mode name is literal.
- **Mono or stereo, and nothing else.** WASAPI lets a caller state any format and has the audio
  engine convert to it. Core Audio's mixdown descriptions are mono and stereo with no converter
  behind them, so `ProcessLoopbackFormat::channels` of 1 or 2 is accepted and anything else —
  including the eight channels that keep a surround-rendering application's bed intact — is
  refused with `kFormatUnsupported`.
- **The rate is the machine's, and is checked rather than converted.** A mixdown tap runs at the
  rate of the device it mixes down to. `capture.hpp` promises samples land in the ring at exactly
  the format the caller asked for, so a tap whose own `kAudioTapPropertyFormat` disagrees is
  refused rather than quietly delivering something else.

A fourth difference is in what is *reported* rather than what is promised, and it rests on an
assumption worth naming. `CaptureStats::frames_silence_filled` stays zero for a tap here, where
the Windows and PipeWire taps both count wall-clock gaps they had to fill for a quiet process.
The reason given in the code is that the aggregate device is clocked by the output device it
names as its main sub-device, not by the tapped application, so its `AudioDeviceIOProcID` is
called every device period whether that application is playing or not. That reading of the API
has not been checked against a running one. If it turns out to be wrong — if a tap delivers
nothing at all while its process is quiet — this backend needs the wall-clock fill the other two
have, and has not written it.

`process_loopback_available()` is **two** gates, and `audio_backend().process_loopback` reports
the same answer with the matching reason — both go through
`iclforge::coreaudio::system_audio_tap_refusal()`, so the two reports of one fact cannot drift apart.

The first is the OS version. The floor is pinned in one place —
`iclforge::coreaudio::kSystemAudioTapMinimumOs` in
`libs/audio/src/backend/macos/coreaudio_names.hpp` — and it is **14.2** rather than the 14.4 some
third-party write-ups require. Apple's SDK annotates the API `API_AVAILABLE(macos(14.2))`, which
is what `@available` and the weak-linked symbols are keyed to, and taking 14.4 would mean
refusing a machine whose own operating system declares the API present, on the strength of a
report nobody on this project can check. That constant's comment records the other figure and why
it was not taken.

The second is not a version test, and it is off by default. **On 2026-09-06 the tap path ran for
the first time anywhere and did not return.** On the Apple Silicon CI leg (macOS 26.6.2),
`AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID` on the tap's private aggregate device parked in `mach_msg2_trap`
inside `HALC_ProxyIOContext::_TellServerAboutStreamUsage`, waiting on a `coreaudiod` reply that
hadn't come 300 seconds later (`sample` caught it in three separate processes). With that request
outstanding the whole process's HAL client was unusable, so the application froze rather than
reporting a failed tap. `Capture::start_process_loopback()` now refuses before it reaches that
call; `ICLFORGE_MACOS_PROCESS_TAP` in the environment turns the path back on for whoever has a Mac
to settle it on, read once at first use.

The macOS 15.7.9 Intel leg ran the same code without hanging on the same day, which is why this
is not written as "macOS cannot do this". Two variables separate those legs — the OS version and
the architecture — and nothing here can say which one matters.

**What that run settled, and it is not what this page expected.** Two of the walls named here
turned out not to be walls:

- **The consent prompt was not it.** Crucible is unsigned and no bundle in this tree declares
  `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription`, and `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap` returned a tap anyway.
  `AudioHardwareCreateAggregateDevice` returned the private aggregate, and
  `kAudioTapPropertyFormat` read back. Everything up to the IOProc registration worked.
- **The runner does have a default output device**, and a window session. `system_profiler`
  names it `Apple Virtual Sound Device`, two channels at 48 kHz, default output and default
  system output; `launchctl managername` answers `Aqua`. That virtual device is what the tap's
  aggregate names as its main sub-device and is clocked by, which makes it the first thing to
  suspect and the first thing to retry on real hardware - though nothing here establishes it as
  the cause.

The missing `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` is still a real gap and still needs no Mac to add;
what has changed is that it is no longer the first thing in the way. DR9 still records what CI
cannot stand in for: no Mac has taken a single sample through this backend, and nobody here has
one.

**So what is claimed is that it compiles, that its version gate answers, and that everything up
to `AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID` succeeds on one hosted runner while that call does not return.**
The first macOS CI attempt at any of it never reached a compiler: it stopped during configure, at
an `install(TARGETS crucible)` rule that named no `BUNDLE DESTINATION` for a target with
`MACOSX_BUNDLE` on. With that fixed, both legs compiled `process_tap.mm` and linked it into
`iclforge_audio`. Their `ctest` runs cover the version gate
(`libs/audio/tests/backend/macos/test_macos_support.cpp`, the one place the `__builtin_available` lowering
is executed rather than merely compiled), the agreement between the capability report and
`process_loopback_available()` and their shared refusal sentence, and — since the Crucible Qt
Quick suites run there — the engine driving the platform seams and being told no by the tap.

## Device notifications

`DeviceWatcher` (`iclforge/audio/device_watcher.hpp`) is implemented here over HAL property listeners
on `kAudioObjectSystemObject`: `kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices` for endpoints arriving and
leaving, and `kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice`/`…DefaultInputDevice` for the two
defaults moving. Core Audio says only "the device list changed", so the watcher keeps the
previous list of device UIDs and diffs against it to produce `kAdded` and `kRemoved` — the
bookkeeping Windows gets from `IMMNotificationClient` and Linux from PipeWire's registry for
free.

`kStateChanged` is never raised, which is a difference rather than an omission: it exists because
a Windows endpoint can stay in the enumerator while becoming disabled or unplugged, where a HAL
device that goes away leaves the device list altogether and is already reported as
`kRemoved`.

Callbacks arrive on the HAL's own notification thread rather than a realtime one, so the property
reads the diff makes are allowed there. The watcher does **not** set
`kAudioHardwarePropertyRunLoop`, and the file says why at length: the older listener API delivered
on the main run loop, which a program that never runs one — `forge`, Crucible's console runner, a
test binary — would register for and then never hear, but that property is process-wide, the newer
`AudioObjectAddPropertyListener` used here delivers on a HAL thread of its own, and the selector
carries a deprecation annotation in recent SDKs that nobody here can check against a `-Werror`
build. If it turns out notifications do not reach a run-loop-less process, that property is the
lever to pull. Registration itself needs no device and no
session, so `audio_backend().device_watch` reports available on any Mac, and the contract case in
`libs/audio/tests/test_audio_backend.cpp` exercises that on the runners: it starts a watcher, checks it
is running, checks a second start is refused, stops it, starts it again and stops it again. That
case passed on both macOS legs, so this is the one part of the backend that has run on a Mac. It
is also the least of it. No callback has ever been seen to arrive, because a hosted runner's
device list does not change while a test is running, so the diff, `kAdded`, `kRemoved` and the
run-loop question above are all still unobserved.

## Building

```bash
export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg
cmake --preset config-macos-llvm-debug
cmake --build --preset build-macos-llvm-debug
ctest --preset test-macos-llvm-debug
```

Swap `macos-llvm` for `macos-llvm-x64` throughout on Intel; drop `-debug` from all three preset
names for a Release build either way. The `ci-macos-llvm`/`ci-macos-llvm-x64` workflow presets
each chain the same three steps in one command. Homebrew's `llvm` formula must be installed (CI
runs `brew install llvm`), and `VCPKG_ROOT` must point at a vcpkg checkout — it supplies Catch2
and {fmt}, mbedTLS, cpp-httplib, libFLAC, Opus and mdns through the `hearth` feature the desktop
presets select, and Boost and Tracy only if you opt into the `adm`/`profiling` features (see
[building.md](../building.md)). `ICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI` defaults **OFF** on both presets, as on Linux
— see [GUI on macOS](#gui-on-macos) below to opt in.

## GUI on macOS

`config-macos-llvm`/`config-macos-llvm-x64` both default `ICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI` to `OFF` for the
same reason the Linux presets do (see [GUI on Linux](../building.md#gui-on-linux)): a Qt kit
isn't assumed present on every Mac, not because `forge-gui` cannot be built here. `cmake/FindQt6.cmake`
already searches both Homebrew prefixes (`/opt/homebrew/opt/qt`/`/opt/homebrew/opt/qt6` on Apple
Silicon, `/usr/local/opt/qt`/`/usr/local/opt/qt6` on Intel), and `apps/forge/gui/CMakeLists.txt`'s
`APPLE` branch — `MACOSX_BUNDLE`, the `.icns` bundle icon, and `qt_generate_deploy_qml_app_script()`
for packaging — was written for this from the start; it was never exercised until the
`macos-llvm` CI leg turned the option on. Opt in explicitly once Qt is installed:

```bash
brew install qt
cmake --preset config-macos-llvm-debug -DICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON
```

Homebrew's `qt` formula is the umbrella Qt6 package — one install pulls in QtDeclarative/QtQuick
and their build-time tooling (`qmlcachegen`) alongside QtCore/QtGui, unlike apt's split
`qt6-base-dev`/`qt6-declarative-dev` packages. Fine for local iteration, where nothing leaves the
machine that built it. CI itself no longer uses it: Homebrew's Qt6 stages its QML plugins as
symlinks back into its own Cellar, computed as though the app were being installed under
`/usr/local`, which is dangling the moment `cpack` stages the bundle anywhere else — every
QtQuick/Controls plugin in a Homebrew-Qt-packaged `.app`, `Fusion` included, so the app cannot
load QML at all once shipped. CI installs the official Qt kit instead (`_ci-macos.yml`'s
"Install Qt (prebuilt)" step has the full story, including the upstream Homebrew issues this
matches). The built app is a bundle,
`build/config-macos-llvm/bin/forge-gui.app` (or `build/config-macos-llvm-x64/...` on Intel);
`forge-gui --smoke` (the same headless check the other platforms run — see
[Verified configuration](../building.md#verified-configuration)) lives at
`forge-gui.app/Contents/MacOS/forge-gui`, not directly under `bin/`, because `MACOSX_BUNDLE` relocates
the executable there — the same property Windows' `WIN32_EXECUTABLE` sits beside but which only
takes effect on `APPLE`.

## Packaging

```bash
cpack --preset pack-macos-llvm       # or pack-macos-llvm-x64 on Intel
```

Produces a DragNDrop image on top of a plain ZIP when the packaging tool is found, the same way
NSIS is on Windows and DEB/RPM are on Linux — each leg's own single-arch `.dmg`/`.zip`, useful as
a nightly packaging smoke test of that architecture alone. Neither `macos-llvm` nor
`macos-llvm-x64` carries `release_package` any more, though: a real tagged release
(`release.yml`, `do_package: true`) instead runs a separate `package-macos-universal` job that
`lipo`-merges both legs' install trees into one universal `.dmg` and ships that as the canonical
macOS package — see [Universal binaries](#universal-binaries) above and
[docs/releasing.md](../releasing.md#what-gets-published). That path has been exercised for real on
the arm64 half: nine beta releases, v0.2.0-beta.1 through v0.9.0-beta.1, shipped a macOS package
through the tag-triggered workflow before the universal merge existed, and v0.10.0-beta.1 shipped
the first universal `.dmg`. `cmake/Packaging.cmake` needed no change for `forge-gui` to join either
leg's own `.dmg`: which targets end up in a package is decided entirely by which `install()`
rules ran, and `forge-gui`'s already runs whenever `ICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI` is `ON` — the DragNDrop
generator itself is unconditional on `APPLE`, GUI or not. No stable (non-beta) release has been
tagged yet. See [Packaging](../building.md#packaging).

Through Homebrew, the personal tap `iainchesworthlabs/iclforge` (the `homebrew-iclforge`
repository, [staged here](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/tree/main/packaging/homebrew))
carries the source formula `iclforge` for the CLI and the cask `iclforge` for the GUI, from the first
release made after the rename: `brew tap iainchesworthlabs/iclforge`, then `brew install iclforge`
or `brew install --cask iclforge`. Until that release has reached the tap, it carries the formula
`ac3forge` and the cask `ac3gui` ([Renamed](../renamed.md#what-a-release-carries)). The app is
neither code-signed nor notarized, so Gatekeeper refuses it on first launch
until it is opened from Finder's context menu or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` is run on it.
Neither route has been run end to end on a Mac.

`hearth.app` declares `CFBundleDocumentTypes`/`UTExportedTypeDeclarations` for `.ac3` and
`.ec3` — a custom `Info.plist.in` (`apps/hearth/ui/`) rather than CMake's default template, since
neither extension is a system-known UTI and each needs its own `UTTypeConformsTo: public.audio`
declaration tying it to `audio/ac3`/`audio/eac3` — and claims them with `LSHandlerRank Owner`.
`apps/forge/gui/packaging/macos/Info.plist.in` no longer does either, because a UTI with two owners leaves Launch
Services to pick one. The release `.dmg` carries `forge-gui.app` and not Hearth, so it registers no
`.ac3` or `.ec3` handler today, and nothing on macOS declares `.ac4`. Configure/build-verified
only, like the rest of this file's GUI coverage below — nobody has opened an `.ac3` file from
Finder on a Mac yet.

## CI: what has and has not been verified

Build, `ctest` (see [Verified configuration](../building.md#verified-configuration) for how the
suite's composition differs from Windows/Linux) and the [gold-reference correctness
gate](../building.md#gold-reference-correctness-gate) all pass on GitHub-hosted runners, on
`macos-llvm`. `forge_gui_qmltests` registers and passes there too. In the leg's first GUI run,
confirmed clean on a second push after two fixes, 582 ctest entries all passed, and that one entry
took 39.74 s of a 56.81 s total run. The fixes were `QSG_RENDER_LOOP=basic` for a Qt Quick
render-loop deadlock, and forcing the `Fusion` style in the test binary for a
native-`ComboBox`-under-offscreen hang (see [GUI on macOS](#gui-on-macos) above and
`apps/forge/gui/tests/qml.cmake` and `qml_test_main.cpp` for the detail).

The SNR numbers from the run that first proved the gold-reference gate on macOS were 61.81 and
61.82 dB, against 67.84 and 67.82 dB on Linux and Windows for the same material. This page and
`ci.yml` used to attribute the gap to Homebrew LLVM's libm against glibc and MSVC. It follows CPU
architecture instead: every arm64 and aarch64 CI leg, `macos-llvm` included, sits about 6.0 dB
below every x86 leg, whatever the OS or C library. `macos-llvm-x64` is the direct comparison, with
the same OS and toolchain stack on x86_64. Its numbers, 67.80, 67.82 and 67.76 dB across three
runs, land with the other x86 legs and not with the ~61.8 dB of the arm64 legs, so two macOS legs
on the same toolchain sit on opposite sides of the split by CPU architecture alone. The difference
is one bit of rounding in the decode path, since the encoder's output is byte-identical on both
architectures. Why arm64 is the lower side is still unanswered, and needs arm64 hardware to
answer, because no emulated run has reproduced it ([Why arm64 and x86-64
disagree](../verification.md#why-arm64-and-x86-64-disagree)). The gate's floors are set per
channel from the lowest value any leg has produced, which on the channels that split is the arm64
value ([One floor per
channel](../verification.md#one-floor-per-channel-not-one-per-file)).

**Crucible on macOS, as of 2026-09-06.** Both legs build it — every `.mm`, every file under
`apps/crucible/engine/src/platform/macos/`, and `bin/crucible.app/Contents/MacOS/crucible` —
and both run its Qt Quick suites: eleven on that date, and sixteen `tst_*.qml` files are in the
tree on 2026-09-30. Of the eleven, eight drive the macOS platform seams themselves rather than
fakes: `Main.qml` starts the engine whenever the window is built, so the session monitor, the
foreground, the default device, the virtual device and the output stage all execute on the
runner.

That is how the one hang this platform half has produced was found. The Apple Silicon leg
(`macos-latest`, macOS 26.6.2) timed out at 300 s on `crucible_qml_tests_firstrun`, `_room`
and `_shell`, which the Intel leg (`macos-15-intel`, macOS 15.7.9) passed. A temporary CI step
ran each of the three alone and took a `sample` of the stuck process: the engine's frame thread
was inside `AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID` on a process tap's aggregate device, and the window's own
thread was blocked behind it in an ordinary device enumeration. See
[Per-application capture](#per-application-capture-the-core-audio-process-tap) for the whole of
it and for the gate that now refuses that path. The three suites run green on both legs since.

Worth separating from that, because the two hangs on this runner have different causes and the
same symptom. `macos-llvm`'s first-ever GUI run deadlocked in the threaded Qt Quick render loop,
which is why `apps/forge/gui/tests/qml.cmake` sets `QSG_RENDER_LOOP=basic` on `APPLE` (see
[GUI on macOS](#gui-on-macos)), and Crucible's suites set `QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software` beside
`offscreen` for the same family of reason. Those are rendering. This one was Core Audio, and no
amount of render-loop configuration would have moved it.

The application itself has never been launched on either leg.

If you have a Mac, running these instructions on local hardware, or launching `forge-gui.app` and
using it, would be new information for this project. CI's `--smoke` run shows that the app starts,
loads its QML and drives an encode headlessly, and does not show that the interactive experience
is right. Consider filing an issue with what you found.
