# Raspberry Pi

ICL Forge runs on Raspberry Pi as a plain **aarch64 Debian/Ubuntu Linux** target, with no
Pi-specific code. This page covers what's specific to that arm64 target and its HDMI output; for the
general Linux picture (toolchains, the ALSA backend, the GUI, packaging), see
[Linux](linux.md) and [Building from source](../building.md) - everything there applies here
unchanged, just with `-arm64` presets.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| What runs here | Everything Linux arm64 runs. There is no Pi-specific code |
| Pi 4 Model B | Validated on the board, as recorded on 2026-08-15: 440 of 440 tests on both compilers, including the hard real-time encode gate. The suite has grown since (the arm64 CI leg ran 3,175 tests on 2026-09-29) and this page records no later full run on the board |
| Bitstream to a real receiver | Confirmed over HDMI to a powered Atmos-capable AVR, over ALSA and over PipeWire |
| AC-4 | The AC-4 decoder and encoder build in the aarch64 legs and no Pi has run them. ALSA can carry AC-4 bursts (see [Linux](linux.md#ac-4)); no receiver is known to accept them |
| Pi 5 | Expected to behave identically; **not validated** on real hardware |
| Pi 3 | Not a supported target — the weaker CPU puts the real-time encode gate at risk |
| OS | 64-bit required (`aarch64`); there is no 32-bit ARM triplet |

The Pi 4B is the measured target. Pi 5 cells describe the shared Linux aarch64 path and are
labelled unrun wherever no Pi 5 has supplied evidence.

## Why there's no Raspberry Pi-specific code

The project's backend tree (`libs/audio/src/backend/{windows,alsa,pipewire,posix,macos,android}/`,
selected by `libs/audio/CMakeLists.txt`, never by `#ifdef` -
`tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1` enforces this in CI)
branches on **operating system**, not architecture or device. A Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS
hits exactly the same `if(LINUX)` branch, the same ALSA backend, and the same
[HDMI/S-PDIF passthrough device-naming logic](linux.md#audio-backend-alsa-or-pipewire) that any x86_64
Debian box does. Enabling this target was almost entirely CMake/vcpkg/CI plumbing - see the two new
`arm64-linux-{gcc,llvm}` vcpkg overlay triplets (`cmake/vcpkg/triplets/`) and the
`config-linux-{gcc,llvm}-arm64[-debug]` presets they back, mirroring the existing `arm64-macos-llvm`
triplet Apple Silicon already uses.

## Supported hardware

| Model | Status |
|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi 4 Model B | Supported. Validated hardware - see [Verified configuration](#verified-configuration) below. |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | Expected to work identically (same BCM27xx SoC family, same `vc4`/`v3d` HDMI/GPU driver stack as the Pi 4) but **not yet validated on real Pi 5 hardware** - don't take this as tested until this page says otherwise. |
| Raspberry Pi 3 | **Not a supported target.** It would use the same arm64 build path as the Pi 4, but its Cortex-A53 CPU is materially weaker than the Pi 4/5's Cortex-A72/A76, and `tests/performance/test_performance.cpp`'s `iclforge-perf` suite gates on a hard real-time encode budget, so some layouts may not make it in time on that CPU class. Building it is possible; it is not validated or promised to keep up in real time. |

A 64-bit OS is required (`aarch64`, not `armhf`/`armv7`) - the project defines no 32-bit ARM triplet,
and none is planned.

## Requirements

Same as [Linux](linux.md#toolchains) generally, but Raspberry Pi OS's own package archive (Debian
13 "Trixie" as of this writing) doesn't necessarily carry the exact GCC 16 / Clang 22 versions CI
pins. `cmake/toolchains/linux.{gcc,llvm}.toolchain.cmake` `find_program` a fallback list
(`gcc-16 gcc-15 gcc-14 gcc-13 gcc` / `clang-22 clang clang-21 clang-20`, in that order), so an older
distro compiler is picked up automatically when it is one of those names. The version pin is a CI
reproducibility choice, not a hard requirement of the code. Trixie's GCC 14 is in the list. Its
Clang 19 is not, and is found only under the unversioned name `clang` (see below). See
[Verified configuration](#verified-configuration) for what was resolved on the board.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config git \
    libasound2-dev \
    qt6-base-dev qt6-base-dev-tools qt6-declarative-dev qt6-declarative-dev-tools
```

Building with the LLVM preset instead of GCC additionally needs `clang-<N>` and, less obviously,
**`clang-tools-<N>`** (owns `clang-scan-deps-<N>`, which CMake's Ninja generator shells out to for
every C++20/23 translation unit's module-dependency scan, not just files using `import`/`export`):

```bash
sudo apt install clang-19 lld-19 clang-tools-19
```

The toolchain file looks for `clang-22`, `clang`, `clang-21` and `clang-20` (and `clang++` to
match); it named `clang-19` until the pin moved to 22 on 2026-08-23. Installing `clang-19` does not
create an unversioned `clang`, so give it one, as `.github/toolchain/03-llvm-toolchain.sh` does for
CI with `update-alternatives`:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/bin/clang-19 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-19 100
```

These two steps were not re-run on a Pi after the pin moved; the validated run below predates it.

Without `clang-tools-<N>`, configure fails confusingly - every `find_package`-driven try_compile
(Qt6, Threads, ALSA) fails too, since they all hit the same missing `clang-scan-deps` binary, which
reads like broken dependency detection rather than a missing package. Substitute Trixie's
`clang`/`lld`/`clang-tools` version for `19` if a future Raspberry Pi OS release ships something
newer.

## Building

Identical to [Building on Linux](../building.md#building-on-linux), with `-arm64` appended to the
preset name:

```bash
export VCPKG_ROOT=/opt/vcpkg
cmake --preset config-linux-gcc-arm64-debug -DICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON
cmake --build --preset build-linux-gcc-arm64-debug
ctest --preset test-linux-gcc-arm64-debug
```

Substitute `linux-llvm-arm64` for `linux-gcc-arm64` to build with Clang instead - same tradeoff as on
x64. `VCPKG_ROOT` supplies what it supplies on every other platform: Catch2 and {fmt}, and the packages
behind Hearth (mbedTLS, cpp-httplib, libFLAC, Opus, mdns) through the `hearth` feature the presets
select by default.

## HDMI output

The Pi's only audio-capable HDMI path is its VideoCore HDMI ALSA card, normally exposed under a name
like `vc4-hdmi` (`bcm2835` on older firmware/kernel combinations). ICL Forge doesn't special-case
this name - `libs/audio/src/backend/alsa/device_names.hpp`'s `classify_digital_output()` already
recognizes any ALSA PCM whose name contains `hdmi` and builds the IEC 60958 channel-status device
string generically. Find the name on a given Pi with:

```bash
aplay -L
build/config-linux-gcc-arm64-debug/bin/forge outputs
```

See [Verified configuration](#verified-configuration) for the exact device name found during
hardware validation.

## Packaging

```bash
cpack --preset pack-linux-gcc-arm64
```

Produces an arm64-labeled `.tar.gz`, plus a `.deb` (`Architecture: arm64`, auto-detected by CPack's
DEB generator via `dpkg --print-architecture` on the build host - nothing here hardcodes an
architecture) and `.rpm` on top when the corresponding tool is on `PATH`. See
[Packaging](../building.md#packaging) for the general shape, and
[docs/releasing.md](../releasing.md#what-gets-published) for what a tagged release
publishes.

## Verified configuration

Run over SSH and recorded on 2026-08-15, on:

| | |
|---|---|
| Board | Raspberry Pi 4 Model B rev 1.1 (2GB) |
| OS | Raspberry Pi OS 13 "Trixie" (Debian 13.6 base), kernel 6.18.34+rpt-rpi-v8 |
| Compilers | GCC 14.2.0 and Clang 19.1.7 (Trixie's apt archive; Trixie has no `gcc-16`/`clang-22` yet). On that date the toolchain files' fallback `find_program` lists named `gcc-14` and `clang-19`, so both were picked up without configuration; the Clang list no longer names `clang-19` (see [Requirements](#requirements)) |
| CMake | 3.31.6, Ninja 1.12.1 |
| Qt | 6.8.2, apt-packaged (`qt6-base-dev`, `qt6-declarative-dev`) |
| ALSA | `libasound2-dev` 1.2.14 |
| vcpkg | checkout at `/opt/vcpkg` |

Both `config-linux-gcc-arm64[-debug]` and `config-linux-llvm-arm64[-debug]` configure, build and
`ctest` all clean: **440/440 tests passing on both compilers**, including the `Performance` label
(`iclforge-perf`'s hard real-time encode gate) - both the Atmos/JOC and plain 5.1 encoders stay
inside their real-time budget on this hardware, and the Qt Quick Test GUI harness
(`forge_gui_qmltests`) passes headless. `forge-gui --smoke` (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`) also runs clean,
encoding audio and instantiating the QML channel meters. A full Release build (`config-linux-gcc-arm64`)
and `cpack --preset pack-linux-gcc-arm64` were also run, producing a `.deb` with
`Architecture: arm64` and a correctly auto-resolved Qt runtime `Depends:` list (`libqt6core6t64`,
`libqt6gui6`, `libqt6qml6`, `libqt6quick6`, `libqt6quickcontrols2-6`, plus `libasound2t64`) - this Pi's
Qt6 came from apt, confirming for the first time on hardware that `cmake/Packaging.cmake`'s "a
system Qt6 install resolves fine through `dpkg-shlibdeps` alone" note holds in practice, not just in
theory.

Builds are slow on this hardware and RAM-constrained (2GB, 4 cores) - a full `-j2` build (CLI, GUI,
tests, all examples) takes roughly 17-22 minutes depending on Debug/Release and compiler; `-j4`
wasn't tried, to leave headroom against OOM.

**Two compiler- and distro-specific issues were found and fixed by this validation:**

1. GCC 14.2.0 at `-O2`/`-O3` (Release only - not seen at Debug) emits a false-positive
   `-Wnull-dereference` inside libstdc++'s own `<streambuf>`/`<bits/stl_construct.h>` internals,
   promoted to a hard error by this project's `-Werror` policy. Not seen on GCC 15, and CI has
   since moved on to GCC 16 (see [Linux](linux.md#toolchains)), where a *different* false
   positive - a `-Warray-bounds` misfire on a short-circuited array access, also inside
   libstdc++, also `-O2`/`-O3`-only - shows up instead. Both are fixed in
   `cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake`, scoped to `GCC < 15` and `GCC >= 16` respectively, so the
   CI-pinned toolchain (both x64 and arm64) only carries the suppression it actually needs.
2. CMake's Ninja generator shells out to `clang-scan-deps` for every C++20/23 translation unit's
   module-dependency scan (not just files using `import`/`export`) - without it, every
   `find_package`-driven `try_compile` (Qt6, Threads, ALSA) fails the same way, which reads as
   broken dependency detection rather than a missing package. `clang-scan-deps-<N>` lives in
   `clang-tools-<N>`, a package neither `clang-<N>` nor `llvm-<N>` pull in. Fixed by adding
   `clang-tools-${LLVM_VERSION}` to `.github/toolchain/03-llvm-toolchain.sh`'s package list -
   unconditionally, since every Linux LLVM leg configures the same way regardless of which distro's
   package split happens to be exercising the gap.

**ALSA/HDMI device names found**:

```
hdmi:CARD=vc4hdmi0,DEV=0   # HDMI port 0
hdmi:CARD=vc4hdmi1,DEV=0   # HDMI port 1 (the 4B has two micro-HDMI outputs)
hw:CARD=Headphones,DEV=0   # bcm2835 analogue out, not HDMI
```

These names exist and are well-formed, but - see the next section - nothing had walked
the device *classifier* against them with a receiver in the loop yet at this point in the
validation, and that turned out to matter.

## Live HDMI passthrough to a real receiver

Verified on hardware: an Atmos-capable AVR connected to HDMI port 0 and powered on, driven from this
same Pi and checkout. This closes the one gap the section above left open, and found a third bug
on the way.

**A third bug, found only on hardware:** `classify_digital_output()` (`device_names.hpp`) judges a
PCM's kind from the name alsa-lib's `snd_pcm_info_get_name()` gives it - "HDMI 0", "IEC958", etc.
on most drivers. vc4-hdmi doesn't follow that convention: every one of its PCMs is named
identically, `MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0`, regardless of which HDMI port it is - "hdmi" only ever appears
in the *card's* own id (`vc4hdmi0`) and name (`vc4-hdmi-0`), which the classifier never looked at.
The result: every vc4-hdmi candidate silently classified as `kNone` and was dropped, so `forge
outputs` reported "no active render endpoints found" even with the receiver fully connected,
EDID-populated, and its `HDMI Jack` ALSA control reading `on`. Fixed by falling back to the card's
id/name when the PCM's own name gives no signal; a regression test in `test_alsa_device_names.cpp`
pins the vc4-hdmi case specifically, alongside the existing HDA-style cases it doesn't change.

With the fix, `forge outputs` reported both HDMI ports correctly (the columns as that build
printed them; the current build adds a `ch` column and `speakers` and `rates` lines under each
row):

```
idx  AC-3       E-AC-3     excl PCM   name
  0  yes        yes        no         vc4-hdmi-0: MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0  [default]
  1  no         no         no         vc4-hdmi-1: MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0
```

(Port 1's all-`no` row is correct, not a bug - nothing is connected to it.)

**Every stream shape tried locked on the receiver, correctly identified:**

| Stream | Result |
|---|---|
| Plain AC-3, 2/0 stereo | Dolby Digital, 2ch |
| Plain E-AC-3, 2/0 stereo | Dolby Digital Plus, 2ch |
| Plain E-AC-3, 5.1 (no object container) | Dolby Digital Plus, 5.1 |
| Atmos `bed51` (5.1 bed, no object container) | Dolby Digital Plus, 5.1 |
| Atmos `objects`, unsigned (object container present, no EMDF tag) | Dolby Digital Plus, 5.1 - a graceful fallback, not the hard refusal [object signing](../concepts/object-signing.md#desktop-cli) warns an unsigned-but-present container can get from a validating decoder. This receiver falls back gracefully instead. |
| Atmos `objects`, signed with a Dolby encoder license key (key and signed assets not part of this repo - see [object signing](../concepts/object-signing.md)) | Atmos confirmed on the receiver's own OSD, 4 height channels active (5.0.4 layout) |

Every case submitted its bursts cleanly - `forge play`'s own stats read 0 underruns throughout,
every time. A couple of early runs looked like they hadn't synced, but that was down to the
short (12 s) clips ending before the receiver's own display could be checked in time; the same
files replayed and locked correctly once watched for their full length. Nothing here needed a
longer runway than that to lock - once the classifier fix above landed, every stream shape locked
on the first attempt.

This is the hardware confirmation the [Linux](linux.md#audio-backend-alsa-or-pipewire) page cites
for HDMI passthrough over ALSA, on Raspberry Pi specifically: verified end to end, from plain AC-3
through Atmos/JOC with height rendering, against a Dolby-licensed decoder.

### Still to check: decoded multichannel output

Everything above is passthrough — the receiver does the decoding. The other direction, where the
Pi decodes and drives the speakers itself, needs two things confirming on this hardware:

```bash
build/config-linux-gcc-arm64-debug/bin/forge outputs
build/config-linux-gcc-arm64-debug/bin/forge identify 0 7.1.4 3
build/config-linux-gcc-arm64-debug/bin/forge identify 0 7.1.4 3 1,0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
```

`outputs` should print a channel count and a speaker list per endpoint, from ALSA's own channel
maps — the Pi's HDMI card reports them, where a plain analogue output often does not, and "not
reported" is a valid answer rather than a fault. `identify` then plays pink noise on one rendered
channel at a time and prints the speaker and output each burst went to, so what is heard can be
compared with what was printed; the third command swaps the front pair and nothing else, which is
the check that the routing patch is what places a channel rather than the order it happens to be
in. Run the same three under PipeWire as well as ALSA — the two report their channel positions
through entirely different calls.
