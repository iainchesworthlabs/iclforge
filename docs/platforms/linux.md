# Linux

ICL Forge builds and is tested on Linux on both GCC and Clang, CLI and GUI alike: Linux GCC in
every pull request, and the other legs in the run after a merge to main or the nightly run (see
[CI for many agents](../ci-agentic.md)). This page covers what is specific to Linux; for the full
preset reference, options list and troubleshooting, see [Building from source](../building.md). Crucible's Linux-only host tooling
(live under [`apps/linux/README.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/apps/linux/README.md))
is separate from the application in `apps/crucible/`.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| What runs here | The library, `forge`, `forge-gui` and Crucible. Hearth (`hearth`) builds and is packaged, and has not been run on Linux |
| Build | GCC and Clang on x64, GCC on arm64: Linux GCC in the pull-request gate, all three after each merge to main. Clang on arm64, the two sanitizer legs and the AppImage run nightly |
| GUI | Opt-in at build time (`-DICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON`), not on by default as it is on Windows |
| Audio backends | ALSA or PipeWire, selected at configure time. Crucible requires PipeWire |
| Bitstream to a real receiver | Confirmed on one machine, a Raspberry Pi 4B: over ALSA on 2026-08-20, and over PipeWire on 2026-09-05, the receiver's own front panel read both times |
| Other Linux hardware | Untried. Treat the Pi as two confirmed configurations on one box, not as Linux generally |
| AC-4 | Decoded and encoded by `forge` and `forge-gui`, decoded by Hearth. ALSA carries AC-4 bursts (IEC 61937-14), tested against ALSA's null device; PipeWire has no AC-4 codec, and no receiver is known to accept AC-4 — see [AC-4](#ac-4) |
| Packaging | TGZ, DEB and RPM, plus an x86_64 AppImage — see [Packaging](#packaging). v0.10.0-beta.1, the latest release, predates the AC-4 decoder and encoder |

The table below separates x86_64 from aarch64 and records where the evidence comes from. The
hardware-confirmed aarch64 entries are measurements from one Raspberry Pi 4B.

## Toolchains

Built and tested with **GCC 16** and **Clang 22.1** on **Ubuntu 26.04 (WSL2)** — the versions
CI pins. Note that 26.04's own archive currently carries `gcc-16` as a pre-release/experimental
trunk snapshot in its `universe` component (`02-gcc-toolchain.sh` enables `universe` to reach
it) rather than the finished 16.1 release, which lands in a later Ubuntu series first — this is
Ubuntu's packaging timing, not a project choice, and the pin tracks whatever `apt` resolves for
`gcc-16` without further action needed here once 26.04 backports the stable release. The pin
itself is a CI reproducibility choice, not a hard floor of the code:
`cmake/toolchains/linux.{gcc,llvm}.toolchain.cmake` `find_program` a fallback list
(`gcc-16 gcc-15 gcc-14 gcc-13 gcc` / `clang-22 clang clang-21 clang-20`, in that order), so an older
distro compiler is picked up automatically when it is one of those names — the [Raspberry Pi
validation](raspberry-pi.md#verified-configuration) built and passed the full suite with
GCC 14.2 and Clang 19.1.7, when the Clang list still named `clang-19` (it no longer does; see
[Raspberry Pi → Requirements](raspberry-pi.md#requirements)).

`config-linux-gcc` and `config-linux-llvm` (each with a `-debug` variant) find the compiler by
that same known-name `find_program` walk, the same way the Windows presets pin MSVC/clang-cl,
rather than trusting whatever is first on `PATH`.

## Audio backend: ALSA, or PipeWire

On Linux, live capture (`forge devices`/`record`), monitor playback (`forge monitor`) and IEC
61937 bitstream passthrough (`forge outputs`/`play`) are implemented over **ALSA** when its
headers are present, and over **PipeWire**'s native `pw_stream` API (not its ALSA-compatibility
shim) when they are not but PipeWire's are. Everything else is file I/O and needs no audio stack
at all — `forge spdif` in particular reaches an AV receiver by writing a WAV, on any machine,
and `forge unspdif` reads one back the same way.

Capture in the other direction — an S/PDIF or HDMI **input** carrying somebody else's bitstream
— is ordinary PCM as far as ALSA and PipeWire are concerned, exactly as passthrough output is
(see [Why ALSA still comes first](#why-alsa-still-comes-first) for why that is the shape of the
problem on Linux). Nothing in either API says "this is Dolby Digital", so `forge record`
recognises the IEC 61937 burst framing itself and writes the elementary stream rather than
encoding the bursts as audio; `forge live` detects the same thing and stops. Neither is
hardware-confirmed — see [What has and has not been verified](#what-has-and-has-not-been-verified)
below — but the burst framing they rely on is verified both ways against FFmpeg's `spdif` muxer.

Both dependencies are optional, detected packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
```

(`alsa-lib-devel` on Fedora, `alsa-lib` on Arch), or

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpipewire-0.3-dev
```

(`pipewire-devel` on Fedora), or both — ALSA wins when both are present, see [Why ALSA still
comes first](#why-alsa-still-comes-first). No PulseAudio development headers, vcpkg port, or
runtime daemon are ever needed by either. Without either set of headers, configure succeeds
anyway and the build selects a no-backend fallback whose entry points return `kNoBackend`;
`forge` marks the affected commands `UNAVAILABLE HERE` in its usage rather than pretending they
exist. `ICLFORGE_WITH_ALSA` and `ICLFORGE_WITH_PIPEWIRE` both default to `AUTO` (build the one
that's found); set either to `ON` to make its own missing headers a configure error instead,
which is what a packaging build wants.

### Why ALSA still comes first

Capture and monitor playback are ordinary PCM, which every Linux audio API can do, and both
backends implement them. Passthrough is the discriminator, and it's what the whole
project is for. On Linux, a bitstream isn't a distinct "format" the way it is on Windows: it's
opened as plain 16-bit stereo PCM, and what tells the receiver these bytes are Dolby Digital
rather than music is the IEC 60958 **channel status** travelling beside them (the non-audio bit,
AES0 bit 1). ALSA is the layer where that bit is expressed, as arguments on the device name
(`iec958:CARD=PCH,DEV=0,AES0=0x06,…`), and it works unconditionally the moment compatible
hardware exists.

PipeWire has its own current, native mechanism for the same bit —
`SPA_MEDIA_SUBTYPE_iec958`, confirmed against a shipped client (Kodi's own PipeWire passthrough
support), not assumed from memory, and since 2026-09-05 against this project's own Raspberry Pi
and its receiver. What it lacks is ALSA's "just works": a PipeWire sink only offers a compressed codec
once its `iec958.codecs` property has been populated by the session manager. WirePlumber does
populate it, from the display's own EDID, so on a receiver that advertises its codecs nothing
needs configuring by hand — the Pi's Atmos receiver came up with
`[PCM, DTS, AC3, EAC3, TrueHD, DTS-HD]` set on its HDMI sink unprompted. On a sink that
advertises nothing, or under a session manager that does not read EDID, the codec list is still
configuration this library cannot perform on a caller's behalf. That dependence on the session
manager — not a capability gap — is why ALSA keeps first precedence whenever both are found,
rather than PipeWire winning by default for being the modern norm on most current desktops. The
full reasoning, and the explicit override for a machine where PipeWire's compressed codecs are
configured, is in [Why ALSA still comes first](../building.md#why-alsa-still-comes-first).

### AC-4

AC-4's bursts (IEC 61937-14) need nothing from ALSA that AC-3's do not: the channel status says
"not audio" whatever the codec, so `PassthroughSink` sends AC-4 on a link at the content rate, as
AC-3 goes, and AC-4 HBR4 at four times it, as E-AC-3 goes. An AC-4 burst is as long as its
frame, so the sink queues bursts of different lengths at the 1000/1001 frame rates. PipeWire
names the codec instead, and its IEC 958 codec list (`spa/param/audio/iec958.h`, 1.6) has no
AC-4, so the PipeWire backend refuses AC-4 with `kUnsupportedFormat`. Both refuse AC-4 HBR16,
which needs the eight-channel high-bit-rate link neither opens. The ALSA path is tested against
ALSA's `null` device (`libs/audio/tests/test_alsa_null_backend.cpp`); no receiver found so far accepts
AC-4, so none has been tried.

So `forge play` decodes an AC-4 stream and plays it as PCM, the way `monitor` does, and `forge
live` with `codec=ac4` gives a bitstream output a 5.1 AC-3 leg. `forge spdif` writes AC-4's
bursts to a WAV and `unspdif` reads them back. In the other direction the capture-side detector
recognises AC-4 bursts as it does AC-3's, and `forge record` then writes the AC-4 elementary
stream; that is tested on synthetic carriers, and no capture device or receiver has produced one.

### What has and has not been verified

!!! note "ALSA and PipeWire are each hardware-confirmed once, on one Raspberry Pi"
    The development loop itself — WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04 with GCC 16 and Clang 22.1 — is headless:
    ALSA with libasound present and absent and under ASan+UBSan with leak detection; PipeWire
    (libpipewire-0.3 1.6.2) with the selection forced via `-DICLFORGE_WITH_ALSA=OFF
    -DICLFORGE_WITH_PIPEWIRE=ON`, since WSL2's image has both sets of headers and ALSA wins by
    default. The full test suite passes in every configuration tried. ALSA's device-independent
    halves (device-name construction, channel-status derivation, negotiation, the render/capture
    threads, start/stop, error mapping) were additionally driven end to end against ALSA's
    software `null` PCM device. WSL2 has no sound devices, no kernel sound modules, and no
    PipeWire session running at all, so nothing built there has ever been bitstreamed to an
    S/PDIF or HDMI output from that environment, and PipeWire's own enumeration has only ever
    seen "no session" (`pw_context_connect()` failing fast, with no graph and no nodes) and never
    a node to negotiate a compressed format against.

    Both backends have met hardware elsewhere, on one Pi 4B and one receiver. ALSA, on
    2026-08-20: see [Raspberry Pi → Live HDMI passthrough to a real
    receiver](raspberry-pi.md#live-hdmi-passthrough-to-a-real-receiver) for every
    AC-3/E-AC-3/Atmos shape tried, bitstreamed to an Atmos-capable AVR over HDMI and correctly
    identified every time. PipeWire, on 2026-09-05: the backend enumerated the receiver's HDMI sink
    with its compressed codecs set by WirePlumber from the EDID, and streamed E-AC-3 bursts to it.
    The receiver's own front panel was read the same evening: "5.1 DD+" from a pre-encoded
    fixture, and "Atmos/DD+" at 7.1 from Crucible's live engine with a placed object, so this is
    confirmed rather than merely delivered. Whether a given output accepts a bitstream is
    per-device anyway; `forge outputs` probes each one and reports what it finds, and since the
    PipeWire run it reports a bitstream format only on a sink whose `iec958.codecs` lists it,
    because the connect alone said yes on a headphone jack. No other Linux hardware has been tried.

## Crucible requires PipeWire

The library's ALSA and PipeWire backends are used by `forge` and `forge-gui`
([Forge](../forge/index.md)). [Crucible](../crucible/index.md) requires PipeWire for
per-application capture. Its build rejects ALSA configurations.

That trade has a cost: forcing PipeWire gives up ALSA's `iec958` route, which works whenever
compatible hardware exists, for PipeWire's, which needs the session manager to have populated
`iec958.codecs` (see above) and has met a receiver once, on the Pi. See
[the plan](../crucible/design/promotion.md#alsa-or-pipewire).

## Reading a sink's own EDID/ELD

`forge play`, given a `device_index`, asks the sink what it actually accepts before committing
to a format — see [CLI → Following the sink](../forge/cli/commands.md#following-the-sink). On ALSA
the HD-audio kernel driver populates
`/proc/asound/<card>/eld#<dev>.<port>` with the sink's own CEA-861 Short Audio Descriptors,
already decoded into text fields, for every HDMI/DisplayPort output — a documented, stable
kernel interface, not a private one this project reaches around. `iclforge::audio::read_sink_capabilities()`
locates the right card/device the same way `enumerate_render_devices()` already does
(`libs/audio/src/backend/alsa/candidates.hpp`, shared between the two) and reads that file.

On PipeWire the read is the session manager's: WirePlumber sets `iec958.codecs` on an HDMI or
S/PDIF node from the sink's ELD, and `read_sink_capabilities()` reports the codecs that property
lists. It gives no LPCM channel count or rate list, because the property carries
neither. A node without the property reads as having no descriptor. The mapping from a node to
the `/proc/asound` file is not attempted, since no property name for it was found confirmed
stable across PipeWire versions and session managers. `play` falls back to the live probe
`outputs` already uses wherever no descriptor can be read.

**Not verified on hardware.** Like the passthrough gap above, the parser
(`parse_eld_proc_text`, `libs/audio/tests/backend/alsa/test_alsa_eld_parsing.cpp`) is unit-tested against
synthesized fixture text matching `/proc/asound` output found in the wild, but this
development loop has no Linux box with an HDMI/DisplayPort sink attached to confirm the file
path resolution and field parsing against. It is also not yet taught to disambiguate multiple
HDMI ports on one card beyond the raw hardware device index embedded in the ALSA device name —
the same numbering [Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md#live-hdmi-passthrough-to-a-real-receiver)
found a classifier bug in already (vc4-hdmi's identically-named PCMs), worth a second
look once multi-port hardware is available to test against.

## GUI: opt-in, not on by default

Unlike Windows, where `ICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI` defaults **ON**, both Linux presets default it
**OFF** — not because the GUI can't be built on Linux (`cmake/FindQt6.cmake` resolves a Linux Qt
kit the same way it resolves a Windows one, and `forge-gui` builds clean and passes its headless
`--smoke` run under both Linux presets in CI), but because a Qt kit isn't assumed to be present
on every Linux machine that builds this project. Opt in explicitly once Qt 6.5+ is installed:

```bash
cmake --preset config-linux-gcc-debug -DICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON
```

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-base-dev-tools qt6-declarative-dev qt6-declarative-dev-tools
```

Other distros need the equivalent Qt6 base + declarative (QML/Quick) packages (Fedora:
`qt6-qtbase-devel` / `qt6-qtdeclarative-devel`). Hearth's and Crucible's windows need Qt 6.8 or
later and are skipped with a warning on an older kit; Hearth builds by default when Qt is found,
and Crucible needs `-DICLFORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE=ON` and PipeWire. See [GUI on Linux](../building.md#gui-on-linux)
for the CMake warnings you'll see about unlinked QML plugins (harmless — a property of how
distro-packaged Qt6 is built, not a missing dependency).

## Building

```bash
export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg
cmake --preset config-linux-gcc-debug
cmake --build --preset build-linux-gcc-debug
ctest --preset test-linux-gcc-debug
```

Substitute `linux-llvm` for `linux-gcc` to build with Clang instead. Add
`-DICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON` to either configure line to build `forge-gui` too, once Qt is installed
(see [GUI](#gui-opt-in-not-on-by-default) above). `VCPKG_ROOT` must point at a vcpkg checkout —
it supplies Catch2 and {fmt}, mbedTLS, cpp-httplib, libFLAC, Opus and mdns through the `hearth`
feature the desktop presets select, and Boost and Tracy only if you opt into the
`adm`/`profiling` features (see [building.md](../building.md)), same as on Windows; this
project's own convention keeps it at `/opt/vcpkg`, but any path works.

## Packaging

```bash
cpack --preset pack-linux-gcc
```

(or `pack-linux-llvm` for the Clang build; append `-arm64` for the arm64 presets). Produces a
plain tarball, plus DEB/RPM on top when the corresponding packaging tool is on `PATH`. A local
run packages whatever the tree was configured with — the GUI only if you opted in. Tagged
releases run `pack-linux-gcc` and `pack-linux-gcc-arm64`, and CI configures those legs
with `-DICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON`, so released Linux packages include `forge-gui`; an arm64 `.deb`
has also been produced and inspected on Raspberry Pi hardware (see
[Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md#verified-configuration)). The packages split by component:
`iclforge` (`forge` and `forge-gui`), `libiclforge0`, `libiclforge-dev` (`iclforge-devel` as an
RPM) and, from main on, `iclforge-hearth`; Crucible's `iclforge-crucible` comes from its own
PipeWire pass. v0.10.0-beta.1, the latest release, has the first three for both architectures
and the x86_64 AppImage; the Hearth and Crucible packages are in no release yet. See
[Packaging](../building.md#packaging).

A GUI-enabled package also installs `forge-gui.desktop` (`Exec=forge-gui %F`), an AppStream metainfo
file, and a shared-mime-info fragment declaring the two media types (`audio/ac3` and
`audio/eac3`) against `*.ac3`/`*.ec3` — `apps/gui/packaging/linux/`, wired into `install()`
behind `if(LINUX)` in `apps/gui/CMakeLists.txt`. `forge-gui.desktop` claims no media type, because
Hearth is the default handler: `hearth.desktop` in the `iclforge-hearth` package
(`apps/hearth/ui/packaging/linux/`) carries `MimeType=audio/ac3;audio/eac3;`. Nothing declares or
claims AC-4. Configure/build-verified only: nobody has installed the resulting `.deb`/`.rpm` on a
desktop and double-clicked an `.ac3` file to confirm the launcher fires.

## AppImage

The `.deb`/`.rpm` above are only as portable as the host distro's own Qt 6 packaging: a distro
whose Qt is too old for this project's `find_package(Qt6 6.5 REQUIRED ...)` floor, or whose
`qml6-module-*` split doesn't match what `qt6-declarative-dev`/`qt6-declarative-dev-tools` expect,
cannot install one of them. `forge-gui` also ships as a self-contained
AppImage that carries its own Qt 6 and QML modules, so that gap doesn't apply — the two package
kinds are complementary, not a replacement for each other.

**AppImage, not Flatpak: the decision is settled.** `forge-gui`'s whole
reason to exist is `iclforge::audio`'s IEC 61937 passthrough — locking a device in exclusive/hog mode
and writing a raw compressed bitstream straight to an AVR, over ALSA's `iec958:...,AES0=0x06`
device arguments or PipeWire's native `SPA_MEDIA_SUBTYPE_iec958` (see [Why ALSA still comes
first](#why-alsa-still-comes-first) above). That is exactly the kind of raw device access
Flatpak's sandbox exists to take away by default; getting it back would mean either a portal that
doesn't speak this vocabulary or blanket `--device=all`/`--filesystem=host` opt-outs that defeat
the sandbox for no benefit here, on top of a Flathub review process and a second (KDE) Qt 6
runtime to track alongside this project's own pinned Qt version. AppImage carries no sandbox at
all, so ALSA/PipeWire device access from inside one works exactly like it does from a normally
installed binary — no portal, no opt-out flags, nothing to maintain going forward.

### Build recipe

```bash
cmake --preset config-linux-gcc -DICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI=ON
cmake --build --preset build-linux-gcc
cmake --install build/config-linux-gcc --prefix AppDir/usr --component runtime
# plus --component library/libruntime too, only if `ldd` on the built forge-gui binary
# shows it dynamically linking a project .so (BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON) - see the
# linux-appimage CI job for the check.
linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage --appdir AppDir \
  --executable AppDir/usr/bin/forge-gui \
  --desktop-file AppDir/usr/share/applications/forge-gui.desktop \
  --icon-file AppDir/usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/forge-gui.png \
  --plugin qt --output appimage
```

The `apps/gui/CMakeLists.txt` `if(LINUX)` block described above already installs exactly the
XDG-shaped layout [linuxdeploy](https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy) expects for an
AppDir — the `--install --component runtime` line is the whole of the CMake side of this, no
extra packaging target needed.

### The actual glibc floor

CI builds the AppImage in an `ubuntu:22.04` container — deliberately *older* than the
`ubuntu:26.04` every other Linux CI leg uses — because an AppImage's whole purpose is running on
a distro older than, or differently put together from, the one that built it; compiling it
against 26.04's much newer glibc would make the result *less* portable than the `.deb`/`.rpm` it
exists to supplement. Ubuntu 22.04 ships glibc 2.35 (`ldd --version`), so that is the floor this
AppImage carries: it needs at least glibc 2.35 on the machine that runs it, and nothing older.
`.github/toolchain/02-gcc-toolchain.sh`'s existing archive-then-PPA fallback (see that script's
own header) reaches GCC 16 on 22.04's older archive with no changes needed; Qt comes from
`jurplel/install-qt-action` rather than `apt`, decoupling the Qt version entirely from the base
image's age, the same way the Windows CI leg already does.

That glibc floor is not the whole portability story, though: GCC 16 also ships a `libstdc++.so.6`
newer than most distros' own, and `linuxdeploy` normally treats `libstdc++`/`libgcc_s` as safe to
assume present the same way it treats glibc itself (they're on the standard AppImage excludelist
its own tooling generates from) — a reasonable default for the AppImage ecosystem's usual case of
building with an *old* toolchain for backwards compatibility, but wrong here, where the toolchain
is deliberately the newest one this project pins. `linux-appimage` force-bundles both with
`linuxdeploy --library` (confirmed necessary against a run's own `usr/lib/`, not assumed) so
the AppImage doesn't quietly trade the glibc floor above for a `libstdc++`/`GLIBCXX` one just as
narrow.

### How this is verified

Configure/build/package-verified in CI (the `linux-appimage` job in `.github/workflows/_build.yml`,
which runs in the nightly run and in a release, never in a pull request or the run after a merge)
— and, one step further than a plain `.deb`/`.rpm` gets, run: the same job then launches
the built AppImage headlessly (`forge-gui --smoke`, `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`) inside a **second, separate
container that never had Qt or a single build tool installed** — `debian:12-slim`, reached via
Docker against the GitHub-hosted runner's own Docker daemon — and asserts it exits 0. That is the
concrete answer to "does this actually run on a distro whose own Qt packages were never
installed". No desktop has installed the produced
`.AppImage` and double-clicked an `.ac3` file, the same caveat the `.deb`/`.rpm` packaging above
carries.

One package is still installed in that second container first: `libasound2`, ALSA's runtime
library, which `debian:12-slim` doesn't ship at all. This is deliberate, not a gap in the AppImage
— it draws the exact same boundary the `.deb`/`.rpm` already draw (`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS`/
`CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_AUTOREQPROV` in `cmake/Packaging.cmake` declare `libasound2` as a runtime
package dependency rather than bundling it), because ALSA is part of the base multimedia stack on
effectively every desktop Linux install, unlike Qt6, which is exactly the piece this AppImage
exists to stop depending on the host for. Bundling `libasound.so.2` instead would also risk a
worse failure than not bundling it: ALSA's plugin/config ecosystem
(`/usr/lib/*/alsa-lib/`, `/etc/asound.conf`) is tied to the *host* system, so a bundled `.so` with
none of that around it could load and then fail to enumerate any device — the opposite
of the point made above for why AppImage was chosen over Flatpak in the first place ("ALSA/PipeWire
access works exactly like a normal installed binary").

## CI

The pull-request gate builds and tests `linux-gcc`, and the run after a merge to main runs
`linux-gcc`, `linux-llvm` and `linux-gcc-arm64` ([CI for many agents](../ci-agentic.md#the-tiers)).
Each of those installs a Qt6 kit and builds and smoke-tests `forge-gui` in addition to the CLI. The
nightly run adds the rest. Two sanitizer legs, `linux-llvm-asan-ubsan` (AddressSanitizer +
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer) and `linux-llvm-tsan` (ThreadSanitizer, over the `concurrency` ctest
label only — `libs/audio/tests/` plus `tests/cli/test_cli_live.cpp`), run only in the nightly run, and
both stay **CLI-only on purpose**, to keep a Qt kit out of the sanitizer legs' install time. They
are separate presets because the two runtimes are mutually exclusive: Clang refuses
`-fsanitize=address,thread`. Some slow passes inside the plain legs are nightly-only too: the
no-ALSA pass and the float32 and fixed-point variants on `linux-gcc`, the no-ALSA pass on
`linux-gcc-arm64`, and the shared-library pass on `linux-llvm` (`deep_only` in
`.github/ci/legs.jsonc`).

Two arm64 legs, `linux-gcc-arm64` and `linux-llvm-arm64`, run the same matrix on ARM hardware
(GitHub's `ubuntu-24.04-arm` hosted runner, not QEMU emulation), the first after each merge and
the second nightly — see [Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md), which is the hardware this arch target
is validated against. `linux-llvm-arm64` also carries the Crucible pass, so the window, its Qt
Quick suite and its `.deb` are built and checked on aarch64 as well as on x86_64 — aarch64 being
the architecture Crucible's Linux half was verified on in the first place.

A separate job, `linux-appimage`, is nightly-only as well: an `ubuntu:22.04` container
(deliberately older than `ubuntu:26.04`) building `forge-gui`'s AppImage and then launching it inside
a second container that never had Qt installed at all — see [AppImage](#appimage) above for what
it builds and why.

The ALSA backend has tests of its own (`libs/audio/tests/backend/alsa/`, `libs/audio/tests/test_alsa_null_backend.cpp`
and `tests/cli/test_cli_live_alsa.cpp`) on top of the base suite, and they run only in a build that
selected ALSA: a Linux build with the GUI on and `libasound2-dev` absent runs the same suite as
Windows without them. `ctest --preset test-linux-gcc-debug` (or whichever preset matches your
build) runs the full suite. See [Verified configuration](../building.md#verified-configuration)
for the full CI matrix.
