# ESP32-C6

The minimum-footprint decoder on an Espressif ESP32-C6: one 160 MHz RISC-V core (RV32IMAC) with
no floating-point unit, 512 KB of SRAM shared with WiFi 6, Bluetooth LE and 802.15.4, and no
external PSRAM, which ESP-IDF does not support on this part. It decodes in the fixed-point tier,
as the [ESP32-C3](esp32-c3.md) does, from the same `firmware/esp-idf/iclforge/` component, whose manifest
lists `esp32c6` beside `esp32s3`, `esp32c3` and `esp32p4`.

Every figure on this page was measured on a board on 2026-09-15, with no network and again with
WiFi connected and a TCP stream arriving while the decoder ran. The I2S section's sink figures are
from 2026-09-16.

The decoder has used less memory since. On the fixed tier the CI probe now reports a peak of
195,505 bytes at most across the fourteen fixtures on the Cortex-M3 leg, the same figures on the
[ESP32-C3](esp32-c3.md)'s QEMU leg for the twelve it runs, and 174,850 and 181,258 bytes for the two
7.1.4 fixtures, where the tables below have 227,662 and 234,070. This part has not been measured
again, so the memory and fit figures below are those of 2026-09-15.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| Decode | Correct: all fourteen fixtures, every channel's level within the probe's tolerance, and every fixed-tier PCM hash equal to the values the x86-64 host, the Cortex-M3 leg and the ESP32-C3 leg are held to (`tests/golden/fixed-probe-pcm-hashes.json`). A fourth architecture on one set of hashes |
| Real time, no network | AC-3 5.1 (0.64x), E-AC-3 5.1 with AHT, spectral extension and coupling (0.75x), an Atmos stream's bed (0.59x), E-AC-3 7.1 (0.87x), and every stereo and mono row. Not the folds to stereo (1.03x and 1.62x), E-AC-3 line mode (1.15x), enhanced coupling (1.71x), 7.1.4 (1.88x) or the Atmos objects rows |
| Real time, with WiFi and a stream | AC-3 5.1 (0.82x), E-AC-3 5.1 with AHT, spectral extension and coupling (0.96x), the Atmos bed (0.71x), a 192 kbit/s E-AC-3 5.1 stream (0.64x), and stereo and mono (0.17x to 0.41x). Not E-AC-3 7.1 (1.09x), the folds, line mode, enhanced coupling or the Atmos objects rows |
| Memory, no network | Every fixture fits: 383,416 bytes free before the decode, largest block 352,256, against a largest peak of 234,070 (7.1.4 folded to stereo) |
| Memory, with WiFi and a stream | About 236,000 bytes free before the decode, largest block 217,088 to 221,184. Everything up to the Atmos objects rows (212,253 bytes of peak) fits, and leaves 18,152 bytes free at the lowest; 7.1.4 (227,662) does not. With ESP-IDF's WiFi IRAM options off every fixture fits, 7.1.4 included, and the decode is slower |
| Encode | Not measured. Both encoders are floating-point, which on this part is software floating point |
| AC-4 | Builds, in the fixed-point tier (`CONFIG_ICLFORGE_AC4`). The decoder peaks at 286,365 bytes at 2.0, against about 236,000 free with WiFi up in ESP-IDF's default configuration and 285,408 with WiFi's code kept in flash, and 383,416 with no network. Not run on the board. See [AC-4](#ac-4). No ESP32 sink takes AC-4 in a Sendspin group |
| QEMU | Not emulated, see [QEMU](#qemu) |
| CI | The component pack builds for `esp32c6` from its archive, and the `build-esp32c3` job builds this probe with both network loads and `hearth_sink` for the part with 4 MB and with 16 MB of flash. Nothing runs. Both are in the `esp` lane of `ci.yml`, which runs after a merge to main that changes the ESP32 trees or a tree its component ships (the [lane table](../../ci-lanes.md#lane-table) lists them), and nightly ([CI for many agents](../../ci-agentic.md#the-tiers)) |

## What the part carries

With WiFi connected and a 1,536 kbit/s TCP stream arriving, in the fixed-point tier:

| Stream | Decodes in real time | Fits in memory |
|---|---|---|
| AC-3 2/0 and 1/0 | Yes: 0.28x and 0.17x | Yes: 49,328 and 47,608 bytes of peak |
| E-AC-3 2/0 | Yes: 0.41x | Yes: 108,094 |
| AC-3 5.1 | Yes: 0.82x. Folded to stereo, no: 1.25x | Yes: 56,685 |
| E-AC-3 5.1 | Yes: 0.96x with AHT, spectral extension and coupling, 0.71x for an Atmos stream's bed and 0.64x for a 192 kbit/s stream. No with enhanced coupling (2.09x), in line mode (1.38x) or folded to stereo (1.92x) | Yes: 164,066, 121,139 and 120,978 |
| E-AC-3 7.1 | No: 1.09x for a 288 kbit/s stream with no Annex E tools | Yes: 152,926 |
| E-AC-3 7.1.4 | No: 1.88x with no network | Not with ESP-IDF's default WiFi configuration: 227,662 bytes, where an earlier run that tried it had a largest free block of 217,088. Yes with WiFi's code kept in flash, [below](#wifis-code-kept-in-flash) |
| Atmos objects, reconstructed or placed onto 7.1.4 | No: 6.52x and 6.71x | Yes, 18,152 bytes left at the lowest |

In the float tier, with the network up, mono is the only row in real time (0.52x).

### 2/0, 5.1 and 7.1 from one generator

The probe has no 7.1 fixture, so the stream set's three layout streams,
`firmware/hearth-sink/www/layout-20.ec3`, `layout-51.ec3` and `layout-71.ec3`,
were decoded on the same board by a copy of the probe with them added as rows. They come from one
generator, use no Annex E tools and hold 32 access units each; 2/0 and 5.1 are 192 kbit/s, and
7.1, a 5.1 substream and a dependent one, is 288 kbit/s. That copy measured time and heap, and did
not check levels. Fixed-point tier; the WiFi column is the slower of two runs.

| Stream | No network | WiFi and a stream | Peak heap |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `layout-20.ec3` 2/0 | 7,487 (0.23x) | 9,872 (0.31x) | 93,270 |
| `layout-51.ec3` 5.1 | 16,492 (0.52x) | 20,322 (0.64x) | 120,978 |
| `layout-71.ec3` 7.1 | 27,816 (0.87x) | 34,755 (1.09x) | 152,926 |

## Measured, on a board

An ESP32-C6 in the QFN40 package, chip revision v0.2, with 16 MB of flash read in DIO mode at
80 MHz, reached over its USB-Serial/JTAG port. ESP-IDF v6.1 and GCC esp-15.2.0_20251204, `-Os`
with the decode-critical sources at `-O2` (`ICLFORGE_MINIMAL_HOT_O2`, the project's default),
the task watchdog off, and 160 MHz as the probe measures it against `esp_timer`.

The probe decodes six frames of each fixture. Its timing is the decoder's own: the level and hash
accumulation it runs inside the decoder's block callback is timed and subtracted.

### Decode time

Microseconds per frame, and that as a fraction of the 32,000 microseconds a frame lasts. With no
network, two runs of the fixed-point build agreed within 3 microseconds on every row. With WiFi,
three runs of the same build varied by up to 16% on the stereo and mono rows and 12% on the
others, and each WiFi cell is the slowest run.

| Fixture | Fixed | Fixed, WiFi | Float | Float, WiFi |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `ac3` 5.1 | 20,500 (0.64x) | 26,164 (0.82x) | 83,324 (2.60x) | 100,056 (3.13x) |
| `ac3_fold` 5.1 to Lo/Ro | 33,002 (1.03x) | 40,100 (1.25x) | 87,152 (2.72x) | 104,083 (3.25x) |
| `ac3_stereo` 2/0 | 6,436 (0.20x) | 8,822 (0.28x) | 28,631 (0.89x) | 34,454 (1.08x) |
| `ac3_mono` 1/0 | 3,486 (0.11x) | 5,332 (0.17x) | 13,389 (0.42x) | 16,518 (0.52x) |
| `eac3` 5.1, AHT, spectral extension, coupling | 23,941 (0.75x) | 30,613 (0.96x) | 105,618 (3.30x) | 122,993 (3.84x) |
| `eac3_ecpl` 5.1, enhanced coupling | 54,629 (1.71x) | 67,036 (2.09x) | 231,125 (7.22x) | 270,525 (8.45x) |
| `eac3_atmos_bed` 5.1 bed | 18,970 (0.59x) | 22,674 (0.71x) | 73,246 (2.29x) | 86,377 (2.70x) |
| `eac3_atmos_objects` | 178,686 (5.58x) | 208,748 (6.52x) | 223,255 (6.98x) | 258,915 (8.09x) |
| `eac3_stereo` 2/0 | 10,193 (0.32x) | 13,133 (0.41x) | 40,417 (1.26x) | 48,418 (1.51x) |
| `eac3_714` 7.1.4 | 60,240 (1.88x) | not run | 275,780 (8.62x) | not run |
| `eac3_fold` 5.1 to Lo/Ro | 51,902 (1.62x) | 61,512 (1.92x) | 117,682 (3.68x) | 136,404 (4.26x) |
| `eac3_714_fold` 7.1.4 to Lo/Ro | 103,183 (3.22x) | not run | 294,249 (9.20x) | not run |
| `eac3_line` 5.1, line mode | 36,650 (1.15x) | 44,294 (1.38x) | 111,316 (3.48x) | 131,286 (4.10x) |
| `eac3_atmos_render` onto 7.1.4 | 184,477 (5.76x) | 214,565 (6.71x) | 231,213 (7.23x) | 269,475 (8.42x) |

"Not run" is the WiFi build's heap budget (`ICLFORGE_PROBE_HEAP_BUDGET_BYTES`, 215,000) skipping
a fixture: `eac3_714` ran out of heap on a 1,692-byte request in the first WiFi run made without
one.

The fixed-point tier is 2.3x to 4.6x faster than float here, except on the two rows that
reconstruct objects (1.25x), where JOC's transform is float in every build. With the network up
the fixed-point decode takes 16% to 53% longer, the smallest fixtures the most.

### Where the time goes

Self time per frame in microseconds, fixed-point tier, no network, from a build with
`-DICLFORGE_STAGE_TIMERS=ON`. A pair of stage markers costs 3.0 microseconds on this part.

| Stage | `ac3` 5.1 | `ac3_stereo` | `eac3` 5.1 | `eac3_atmos_bed` | `eac3_stereo` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| IMDCT and overlap-add | 13,398 | 3,846 | 11,553 | 11,599 | 3,943 |
| AHT dequantisation and inverse | - | - | 4,434 | - | 1,680 |
| spectral extension | - | - | 4,096 | - | 1,641 |
| mantissa read and dequantisation | 2,550 | 1,272 | 500 | 2,916 | 415 |
| decoupling | 1,174 | 7 | - | - | - |
| bit allocation | 1,073 | 435 | 766 | 907 | 448 |
| exponents | 363 | 221 | 337 | 510 | 172 |
| everything else | 2,254 | 983 | 2,628 | 3,259 | 2,231 |
| total | 20,812 | 6,764 | 24,314 | 19,191 | 10,530 |

The transform and overlap-add are 64% of an AC-3 5.1 frame, 48% of E-AC-3 5.1 and 60% of the
Atmos bed. An AC-3 5.1 frame is 36 blocks of transform and overlap-add, six channels in each of
six blocks, about 370 microseconds each here. On the [ESP32-S3](esp32-s3.md#where-the-time-went),
in float with its FPU at 240 MHz, the same stage measured 4.8 ms of an AC-3 5.1 frame and 3.4 ms
of an E-AC-3 one.

### The fixed-point arithmetic on this core

Before the changes below, the same stage was 25,326 of 34,490 microseconds of an AC-3 5.1 frame,
about 700 a block. Disassembled (`riscv32-esp-elf-objdump` on the `-O2` objects), each of the
2,436 Q7.24 products in a long block's IMDCT was the two halves of a 64-bit multiply (`mul` and
`mulh`), a carry for the rounding and a shift, then four branches on the high word for
`Fixed32`'s saturation, two of them taken on every product. The overlap-add after it converted
each sample with the ROM's `__floatsisf`, scaled it with `__mulsf3`, and shifted on 64 bits
through `__ashldi3` and `__ashrdi3` whenever the two halves' exponents differed. The E-AC-3 tools
added a 64-bit division (`__divdi3`) for each AHT mantissa and about six (`__udivdi3`) for each
square root of a spectral extension band.

Each change below leaves the fixed-point tier's PCM identical on every fixture: the pinned hashes
(`tests/golden/fixed-probe-pcm-hashes.json`) do not move, and `libs/ac3/tests/core/test_fixed32.cpp`,
`libs/ac3/tests/core/test_mdct_fixed.cpp` and `libs/ac3/tests/decoder/test_block_norm.cpp` hold each new form to
the arithmetic it replaces. Microseconds per frame, no network, two runs of each build, which
agreed within 3 microseconds; each row includes the ones above it:

| Change | `ac3` 5.1 | `eac3` 5.1 |
|---|---:|---:|
| None: the starting build | 34,619 | 38,673 |
| The IMDCT pair's products without the saturation, which a value below 90.5 times a factor of at most one cannot reach: seven instructions and no branch (`mdct_fixed.hpp`) | 27,981 | 32,331 |
| The overlap-add on 32 bits, with the power of two applied to the converted sample's exponent field (`block_norm.hpp`) | 24,382 | 28,847 |
| The transform's functions placed in IRAM by a linker fragment | 24,088 | 28,894 |
| The output float built from the integer's bits instead of by `__floatsisf` | 22,102 | 27,505 |
| `Fixed32`'s product testing its saturation once, marked likely: ten instructions and a branch not taken (`fixed32.hpp`) | 21,713 | 26,257 |
| `Fixed32`'s power-of-two and integer scaling on 32 bits | 20,491 | 25,658 |
| The IRAM fragment taken out again | 20,531 | 25,838 |
| The AHT inverse's and the spectral extension blend's products without the saturation, and ratios of small integers in two 32-bit divisions | 20,495 | 24,237 |
| The integer square root started from the root of its top 32 bits | 20,499 | 23,941 |

The same source as the starting build, built in another tree, measured 34,725 and 38,681: code
placement alone moves a build by about 100 microseconds. The IRAM placement bought 294
microseconds of AC-3 5.1 and none of E-AC-3 when it went in, 40 and 180 when it came out, and
costs 5,056 bytes of heap at boot, so the probe does not carry it. A product taken from the high
word of a 32x32 multiply alone would lose the rounding bit in the low word and change the
output, so every product keeps both halves.

### Memory

Bytes. The WiFi column's ranges span three runs of the fixed-point build.

| | No network | WiFi and a stream |
|---|---:|---:|
| Free at boot | 383,416 | 295,104 |
| Free after joining the network | - | 241,432 to 241,636 |
| Free before the decode, the stream arriving | 383,416 | 236,080 to 236,580 |
| Largest block before the decode | 352,256 | 217,088 to 221,184 |
| Lowest free during the run | 145,364 | 18,152 to 19,084 |
| Main task stack left of 32,768 | 10,520 | 10,512 |

The WiFi image leaves 88,312 fewer bytes free at boot, before WiFi starts: `idf.py size` puts
59,728 more bytes of code in RAM, where ESP-IDF's defaults place parts of the WiFi and PHY code,
and 28,509 more of data and bss. Joining the network and taking an address uses about 53,500
more, and the receiving task's 4,096-byte stack, its socket and the first segments about 5,000 to
7,000.

Peak heap per fixture, the same with and without the network, since the decoder allocates the
same bytes whatever else runs:

| Fixture | Fixed | Float |
|---|---:|---:|
| `ac3` 5.1 | 56,685 | 56,421 |
| `ac3_fold` 5.1 to Lo/Ro | 58,733 | 58,469 |
| `ac3_stereo` 2/0 | 49,328 | 49,304 |
| `ac3_mono` 1/0 | 47,608 | 47,596 |
| `eac3` 5.1, AHT, spectral extension, coupling | 164,066 | 156,602 |
| `eac3_ecpl` 5.1, enhanced coupling | 153,593 | 153,113 |
| `eac3_atmos_bed` 5.1 bed | 121,139 | 120,659 |
| `eac3_atmos_objects` | 211,883 | 211,403 |
| `eac3_stereo` 2/0 | 108,094 | 105,518 |
| `eac3_714` 7.1.4 | 227,662 | 220,366 |
| `eac3_fold` 5.1 to Lo/Ro | 170,422 | 162,958 |
| `eac3_714_fold` 7.1.4 to Lo/Ro | 234,070 | 226,774 |
| `eac3_line` 5.1, line mode | 164,142 | 156,678 |
| `eac3_atmos_render` onto 7.1.4 | 212,253 | 211,773 |

### The network load

`CONFIG_ICLFORGE_PROBE_NETWORK_WIFI` (`firmware/baremetal/platform/esp32c6/main/net/wifi/`) joins the
access point, turns modem sleep off, listens on TCP port 4953 and reads what arrives from a task
at priority 5: above the decode on the main task at priority 1, below WiFi and lwIP. That is the
load a Sendspin player carries, since the Sendspin server connects to the player. The probe
starts once 32,768 bytes have arrived, and the bytes are counted and dropped.

A host sent 1,536 kbit/s in 32 ms chunks, the rate of 48 kHz 16-bit stereo PCM, cycling the bytes
of `apps/demos/wasm/assets/demo.ec3`. During the decode the part received 1,500 to 1,537 kbit/s, and
the longest gap between two reads was 81 to 114 ms. The access point negotiated 802.11n on
channel 1 at -61 dBm, so the part's WiFi 6 was not exercised.

### WiFi's code kept in flash

ESP-IDF's defaults put parts of the WiFi and PHY code in RAM (`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_IRAM_OPT`,
`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_EXTRA_IRAM_OPT`, `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_RX_IRAM_OPT`, `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SLP_IRAM_OPT`
and `CONFIG_ESP_PHY_IRAM_OPT`). With all five off, the same fixed-point WiFi build was run twice
with no heap budget:

| | Defaults | IRAM options off |
|---|---:|---:|
| Code in RAM (`idf.py size`) | 93,190 | 44,804 |
| Free at boot | 295,104 | 343,968 |
| Free before the decode | 236,080 to 236,580 | 285,408 to 285,428 |
| Largest block before the decode | 217,088 to 221,184 | 262,144 to 270,336 |
| Lowest free during the run | 18,152 to 19,084 | 37,528 to 38,588 |
| `eac3_714` 7.1.4 | out of heap | 95,547 (2.99x) |
| `eac3_714_fold` 7.1.4 to Lo/Ro | not run | 155,716 (4.87x) |
| `ac3` 5.1 | 26,164 (0.82x) | 34,871 (1.09x) |
| `eac3` 5.1 | 30,613 (0.96x) | 39,716 (1.24x) |
| `eac3_atmos_bed` 5.1 bed | 22,674 (0.71x) | 33,526 (1.05x) |
| `ac3_stereo` 2/0 | 8,822 (0.28x) | 14,978 (0.47x) |
| `eac3_stereo` 2/0 | 13,133 (0.41x) | 17,444 (0.55x) |
| `ac3_mono` 1/0 | 5,332 (0.17x) | 6,555 (0.20x) |

Every fixture fits with the options off, and the stream still arrived at 1,536 and 1,537 kbit/s.
The WiFi code then runs from flash, as the decoder's does. The decode is slower and varies more
between runs, up to 41% on the stereo and mono rows and 19% on the others; each time is the
slowest run. Stereo and mono stay in real time either way, and 5.1 does not with the options
off.

## I2S

The part has one I2S controller. ESP-IDF v6.1 holds a TDM slot configuration to
`I2S_LL_SLOT_FRAME_BIT_MAX`, 128 bits a frame on this part as on the ESP32-S3
(`components/esp_driver_i2s/i2s_tdm.c`), so one line carries eight 16-bit slots or four 32-bit
ones and nothing wider. On the board, a scratch application opened a master TDM channel for
every slot count from 2 to 16 at 16, 24 and 32 bits and wrote a second of 48 kHz frames to each
one the driver accepted, timing how long the writes took to drain:

| Slot width | Accepted | Drained a second of frames in 999 ms | 937 ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16 bits | 2 to 8 slots; 9 to 16 refused (`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG`) | 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 slots | 3 and 5 slots |
| 24 bits | 2 to 5 slots; 6 to 16 refused | 2 and 4 slots | 3 and 5 slots |
| 32 bits | 2 to 4 slots; 5 to 16 refused | 2, 3 and 4 slots | - |

The 937 ms shapes play 6.7% fast. The driver's clock setup (`i2s_tdm_calculate_clock` in the same
file) divides the MCLK by the bit clock in integers and only logs a warning when it does not
divide: with the default MCLK of 256 times the sample rate, three 16-bit slots need 5.33 and get
5, and the frame runs at 51,200 Hz. A divider of 2 or less is raised to 3 with the MCLK adjusted
to match, which is why six, seven and eight slots come out exact. So a TDM line on this part runs
correctly at the full 128-bit frame, eight 16-bit slots or four 32-bit ones, with the slots a
layout leaves unused written as zeros. Nothing was connected to the pins; a DAC on the line is
not part of this measurement.

Getting samples onto those slots costs time here too. The decoder hands a sink planar `float`
blocks, and the component's interleaves
(`firmware/esp-idf/iclforge/include/iclforge/interleave.hpp`) turn each sample into a slot. Scaling,
clipping and converting one in `float` is four calls into the software floating-point routines
on a part with no FPU, so the component computes the same integers from the sample's IEEE-754
bits wherever `CONFIG_SOC_CPU_HAS_FPU` is unset, which is this part. Both forms are timed below.
The bits column is what a sink here runs; the float one is the same interleave converting in
`float`, which is what a part with an FPU runs and what this part ran before the component chose
by capability. One build at `-Os`, one frame of six 256-sample blocks, best of five runs:

| Work per frame | In float | From the bits |
|---|---:|---:|
| Eight interleaved 16-bit slots (`interleave_16in16`) | 12,052 | 3,839 |
| Four interleaved 32-bit slots (`interleave_24in32`) | 5,197 | 1,428 |
| A stereo pair (`interleave_16`) | 2,879 | 770 |
| A float level meter over eight slots, squares summed sixteen at a time | 9,153 | - |

That is about a microsecond a sample in `float` against 0.3 from the bits. The level meter in
front of the sink is `float` either way, at about 0.7 a sample, so it is now the larger half of
what a sink spends on eight 16-bit slots: 9,153 microseconds against 3,839.

Those two add to 12,992 in isolation, which is the figure to hold a whole sink against. The
streaming example playing a 7.1 stream onto eight 16-bit slots on this board reports
`sink_us_per_frame` of 12,309, where the same sink converting in `float` reported 20,875. The
end-to-end figure comes in under the sum because a plain build compiles the sink's own source at
`-O2` (`ICLFORGE_MINIMAL_HOT_O2`) and the conversion inlines into the interleave's loop, where
this benchmark at `-Os` called it once a sample. That is the general rule for these numbers: a
conversion's cost depends on whether it inlines where it is called, and in this benchmark the
24-in-32 form inlined and the 16-bit one did not.

The sink is no longer the largest piece of that play. The same run takes 44,849 microseconds a
frame against the frame's 32,000 - 28,923 of decode, 3,617 of render and the sink's 12,309 - so
a 7.1 stream on eight slots is 1.40 times real time here, and the decode is what would have to
give.

What the stream carries decides that, not what the sink opens. The same eight 16-bit slots fed
from a 5.1 stream, with the two slots it has nothing for zeroed, come to 31,875 microseconds a
frame over eight laps: 17,131 of decode, 2,762 of render, 11,982 of sink. That is 0.996 of real
time, and it plays, with 24 of its 1,536 writes finding the queue empty - 16 milliseconds in all,
against 2,086 for the 7.1 stream. Both runs are the same build of the streaming example from the
same board, `CONFIG_ICLFORGE_EXAMPLE_I2S_SLOT_BITS=16` onto `7.1`, from the FAT partition with no
network.

## AC-4

The AC-4 decoder's fixed-point tier ([`planning/ac4.md`, D14d](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/ac4.md#d14d-the-c6-fixed-point))
builds for this part from the same component, with `CONFIG_ICLFORGE_AC4`. Measured on 2026-10-03
on the host and under QEMU, with the decoder's memory work of
[D14f](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/ac4.md#d14f-the-decoders-memory)
in; the board has not run it.

| | Fixed | Float |
|---|---:|---:|
| An image of the AC-4 decoder alone (`idf.py size`, `-Os`) | 1,164,592 bytes | 942,464 bytes (before D14f) |
| Its static RAM | 48,560 bytes | - |
| The frame-rate converter's tables, in flash | 196,464 bytes, Q1.30 | 196,464 bytes, `float` |
| The inverse transform's tables for a 2048-sample frame, in flash | about 69 KB, Q7.24 | about 53 KB, `float` |

The fixed image links the Q1.30 tables and no `float` one. The 1001/960 table, 188,376 bytes, is
read in place from flash; the two smaller ones are copied into the filter.

What a decode holds, from the AC-4 probe on the Cortex-M3 leg, whose peaks RV32IMC gives too
(its stack is a few hundred bytes larger); D14d's figures beside them:

| Fixture | Peak heap | At D14d | Stack |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `ac4_20_music` 2.0, A-SPX | 286,365 | 429,667 | 18,380 |
| `ac4_20_companding` 2.0, A-SPX with companding | 329,147 | 486,331 | 21,064 |
| `ac4_20_acpl` 2.0, A-CPL | 426,918 | 626,368 | 21,064 |
| `ac4_51_music` 5.1 | 704,311 | 970,430 | 21,064 |
| `ac4_51_acpl` 5.1, A-CPL | 868,424 | 1,172,502 | 21,064 |
| `ac4_514_tones` 5.1.4 | 1,502,903 | 1,825,056 | 21,064 |

With WiFi up in ESP-IDF's default configuration the part had about 236,000 bytes free and a
largest block of 217,088 to 221,184 ([Memory](#memory)): less than the smallest peak. With WiFi's
code kept in flash it had 285,408, level with 2.0's 286,365, and with no network 383,416, which
holds 2.0 with about 97,000 bytes to spare. The largest single allocation at 2.0 is a frame's two
parsed tracks, 31,168 bytes, so the largest free block is not what limits it. The Sendspin player's ring,
WebSocket server and WiFi buffers leave less than the probe's network image does, so a C6 sink
takes AC-4 programmes from Hearth as PCM (`planning/ac4.md`, decision 32) until a board run says
otherwise. The fixed tier's PCM hashes are those of the x86-64 host and the Cortex-M3 leg
(`tests/golden/ac4-fixed-probe-pcm-hashes.json`).

## QEMU

ESP-IDF v6.1's `qemu-system-riscv32` (esp_develop_9.2.2_20260417) emulates one Espressif machine,
`esp32c3`, and `idf.py qemu` refuses this target with "QEMU is not supported for target
esp32c6". There is no emulated leg for the part: CI builds it, and every figure here comes from
the board.

## Building

`firmware/baremetal/platform/esp32c6/` is the probe target:

```bash
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
cd firmware/baremetal/platform/esp32c6
idf.py set-target esp32c6
idf.py build                                  # fixed-point tier, no network
idf.py -DICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR=float build   # the float tier
idf.py -p <PORT> flash monitor
```

The WiFi load is `sdkconfig.wifi`, with the credentials (`CONFIG_ICLFORGE_PROBE_WIFI_SSID` and
`CONFIG_ICLFORGE_PROBE_WIFI_PASSWORD`) in a file of their own outside the repository:

```bash
idf.py -B build-wifi -DSDKCONFIG=build-wifi/sdkconfig \
  "-DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.wifi;/path/to/credentials" build
```

It prints `net.ip=` once it has an address and waits up to two minutes for a stream. Anything that
connects and sends will do; the figures above came from a sender paced like this one:

```python
import socket, sys, time

host, port, kbit, path = sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2]), int(sys.argv[3]), sys.argv[4]
payload = open(path, "rb").read()
chunk = kbit * 1000 // 8 * 32 // 1000  # bytes per 32 ms
with socket.create_connection((host, port)) as s:
    offset, due = 0, time.perf_counter()
    while True:
        data = (payload[offset:] + payload)[:chunk]
        offset = (offset + chunk) % len(payload)
        s.sendall(data)
        due += 0.032
        time.sleep(max(0.0, due - time.perf_counter()))
```

## What was not measured

- Levels for the three stream-set rows, which ran in a copy of the probe with no reference
  levels for them.
- WiFi 6, stream rates other than 1,536 kbit/s, and modem sleep on.
- The float tier with WiFi's code kept in flash.
- Encode.

Playback (I2S, a DMA queue, underruns) and a second board are outside this probe's own scope, but
both are covered on the part now: `hearth_sink`'s Sendspin player runs on this board, and its
[README, "On the ESP32-C6"](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/firmware/hearth-sink/README.md#on-the-esp32-c6)
has the clock, memory and two-board figures.

## Where to go next

- [ESP32-C3](esp32-c3.md): the same tier under `qemu-riscv32` in CI, and why a part with no FPU
  wants it.
- [ESP32-S3](esp32-s3.md): the part with an FPU, where every fixture decodes in real time.
- [Bare metal overview](index.md): how the pages in this section relate.
