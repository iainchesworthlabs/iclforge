// The extension's three optional submodules, behind declarations so the one
// PYBIND11_MODULE body can register them without knowing whether they have
// anything to register.
//
// `ac3.signing`, `ac3.containers` and `ac3.ac4` exist only when the configure
// that built this extension also built the libraries behind them - iclforge::signing,
// the matroska/mp4/mpegts trio, and iclforge::ac4 (see
// python/CMakeLists.txt, and the options' comments in the root CMakeLists.txt).
// A trimmed developer build - codec only - still produces a working extension
// without them; the wheel build (python/pyproject.toml) turns every one of
// those targets ON, so a published wheel always carries the full surface.
//
// That used to be two `#ifdef ICLFORGE_PY_HAVE_*` blocks, about three hundred
// lines of them, inside bindings.cpp's module body. Each is now its own
// translation unit in a {present,absent} directory pair, selected by CMake on
// exactly the same condition that decides the compile definition did - which
// is how every other either/or in this repository is answered (see
// src/core/transform/{reference,stub}/, src/internal/avx2/none/,
// tests/ac3/core/avx2/{present,absent}/ and tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1
// for the rule itself).
//
// The absent variants are not empty files: each registers nothing and says so.
// A caller reaching for ac3.signing in a build without it gets Python's own
// AttributeError on the missing submodule, exactly as before.
