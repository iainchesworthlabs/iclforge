// What firmware/baremetal/encode_probe.cpp expects its own encode to produce
// (minimum-footprint decoder profile).
//
// Unlike the decode side's fixture.hpp this is not generated from a committed
// WAV by a committed tool - there is no WAV. The probe synthesises its input
// from a formula (see fill_signal) precisely so that six frames of 5.1 PCM does
// not have to be linked into an image, and these are the sizes and checksums
// that formula's output encodes to.
//
// To regenerate: build the host shape of the profile and run it. It prints
// every number below on its own key=value lines, and it is the same code the
// target runs, so no second implementation of the generator has to be kept
// agreeing with the first.
//
// cmake --preset config-linux-gcc-minimal-encoder
// cmake --build --preset build-linux-gcc-minimal-encoder
// ./build/config-linux-gcc-minimal-encoder/bin/iclforge-probe
//
// Since 2026-09-10 the profile's encoders run their analysis front end -
// transient detection, the block gather, the analysis window and the forward
// transform - in float (ac3/internal/encode_scalar.hpp, float32 under this
// profile), so these hashes are the FLOAT front end's bitstreams: the same
// recipe as the ordinary build's with float rounding, a different and equally
// valid stream. The host shape of the profile is the same float build, which
// is what keeps "regenerate on the host" true; the ordinary double build's
// streams are pinned elsewhere, by tests/golden/bitstream-hashes.json.
//
// Re-pinned 2026-10-08 for planning/consolidation.md decision 20: the forward transform
// runs on the family's one FFT, whose float rounding differs from the radix-4/2 kernel's, and
// these six streams quantise differently. The double build's streams did not move.
//
// What a hash match establishes and what it does not: it says the target's
// encoder produced the same bitstream the host's did from the same input. It
// does NOT say either is correct - tests/golden/bitstream-hashes.json and the
// FFmpeg/Dolby comparisons in tools/ci/ are what say that, on the host where
// there is something to compare against. This is a REGRESSION reference, the
// same standing fixture.hpp has on the decode side.

//
// A third row for one reason: without it the ENCODER's enhanced-coupling path
// is linked into this profile and executed by none of it. The row above uses
// the default tools, which is no coupling at all, so fit_ecpl_band - the
// single largest allocator in the encoder - never ran under any probe. Exactly
// the gap the DECODE side had before fixture.hpp grew its own eac3_ecpl
// stream, and found the same way: by asking what the fixtures do not reach.
//
// WHY 2/0 AND NOT 5.1. Because 5.1 does not fit, and that is worth stating
// rather than working around quietly. Enhanced-coupling encode at 3/2+LFE
// peaks at 343,483 bytes on the host profile and dies on an ESP32-S3 with
// `out_of_memory bytes=147456` - one allocation of 6 channels x 6 blocks x 256
// doubles x 2, against a largest free run smaller than that by the time the
// other two fixtures have run. It is not a ceiling to raise: the part has
// 277,400 bytes free in total and this asks for 343,483.
//
// 2/0 reaches the same code - the same fit_ecpl_band, the same per-band
// amplitude/angle/chaos search, the same §E3.5 syntax - at a third of the
// channel count, so the path is covered and the profile still fits. What is

// tools' own numbers: 5.1 at 256 kbit/s with the three permitted peaks at
// 369,790 bytes on the host profile, and each on its own says which part of
// that is whose - AHT alone 312,744, standard coupling alone 289,202,
// spectral extension alone 205,718, against 223,020 for the plain 5.1 row.
// AHT's per-channel six-block store and coupling's shared-channel state are
// what a 5.1 encode with either tool cannot fit beside on an ESP32-S3 whose

//
// WHY THE BAND EDGES ARE PINNED. At 2/0 and 192 kbit/s the rate defaults put
// spectral extension's start below where coupling would begin, and §E3.3.1
// derives the coupling end from the spx start, so with both merely permitted
// the encoder drops coupling and the frame is spx+aht - the same bytes as
// asking for those two alone. cplbegf 0 (coupling from coefficient 37) and
