// The probe's half of the stage-timer zone backend
// (libs/base/variants/profiling-stage_timers/, selected by
// ICLFORGE_STAGE_TIMERS). The library's ICLFORGE_ZONE_SCOPED_N() markers call
// two functions this application defines - see stage_timers.cpp - and this
// header is what the probe itself reads the result back through.
//
// Compiled into every shape of the probe, whether or not the library was
// built to call it: when it was not, nothing calls zone_enter, the table
// stays empty, report_stages() prints nothing and --gc-sections drops the
// rest. So the ONLY difference between a timed build and a plain one is the
// library's include path, which is the property that keeps the two builds'
// decode arithmetic identical and their timings comparable.
