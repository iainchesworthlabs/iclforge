// The Cortex-M reset vector for the minimum-footprint decoder probe
// (minimum-footprint decoder profile). Two words at address 0, which is the whole of what this core
// needs to start: the initial stack pointer, then the address to begin
// executing at. Everything after that - zeroing .bss, running static
// constructors, calling main, and turning main's return value into a
// semihosting exit - is newlib's crt0 and rdimon, reached through _start.
//
// This is the only file in the repository whose contents depend on the
// PROCESSOR rather than on the operating system, which is why it sits in its
// own platform directory and is added to the target only by the cross build
// (firmware/baremetal/CMakeLists.txt) - the same mechanism libs/audio's backends
// and ac3/internal/profiling.hpp use, and the reason nothing here needs an
// #ifdef.
