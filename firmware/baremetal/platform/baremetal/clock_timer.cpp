// iclforge_probe::now_us() for arm-none-eabi on QEMU's mps2-an385, read from the
// board's CMSDK APB TIMER0 rather than from semihosting's std::clock().
// Selected by ICLFORGE_BAREMETAL_CLOCK=timer (firmware/baremetal/CMakeLists.txt);
// clock.cpp beside this file is the default.
//
// WHY A SECOND CLOCK EXISTS. Under `qemu-system-arm -icount shift=0` the
// guest's virtual clock advances by exactly one nanosecond per executed
// instruction, deterministically, whatever the host is doing. Semihosting's
// std::clock() does not follow it - QEMU answers that call from the HOST's
// clock - but the board's timers do, and TIMER0 here runs from the AN385's
// 25 MHz peripheral clock: one tick every forty nanoseconds, so every forty
// instructions. What the probe then prints as microseconds is instructions
// divided by a thousand, the same on every machine and every run, and
// tools/checks/run_baremetal_probe.sh --icount is what reads it back as
// `<fixture>.instructions_per_frame=` and gates it.
//
// It is a count of Thumb-2 instructions on a soft-float Cortex-M3, not cycles
// on any real part; its value is that it is deterministic and moves when the
// code does, which the host-time figure never was. Outside -icount this clock
// still works - it then measures QEMU's virtual time at whatever pace the
// host manages, which is the same thing std::clock() was measuring.
//
// Register map of the CMSDK APB timer (Arm DDI 0479, §4.1): CTRL at +0x00
// (bit 0 enable, bit 3 interrupt enable), VALUE at +0x04, RELOAD at +0x08.
// It counts DOWN from RELOAD and reloads at zero; at 25 MHz a 32-bit reload
// wraps every 171 seconds of virtual time, and a whole probe run under
// -icount is a few seconds of it, so no wrap is handled - a reading past a
// wrap would come back small rather than wrong-looking, and the runner's
// ceilings would call it out as a regression the wrong way round, which is
// still not silent.
