// The minimum-footprint ENCODER probe (minimum-footprint decoder profile): iclforge::ac3_minimal
// encoding real audio on a target with no operating system, no filesystem and
// no C++ exceptions, and reporting what that cost.
//
// The mirror of probe.cpp, which does the same for the decode direction, and it
// answers the same three questions. Two things about it are different, and both
// follow from the direction rather than from taste:
//
//   1. The INPUT is synthesised, not linked in. A decoder's fixture is a
//      bitstream - 10,752 bytes for six frames of 5.1 AC-3, which is nothing.
//      An encoder's fixture is the PCM those frames came from: 221,184 bytes
//      for the same six frames, which is most of an ESP32-S3's internal SRAM
//      and more than the arm-none-eabi image ceiling has spare. So the signal
//      is computed here instead, from a formula, costing a few hundred bytes of
//      code and giving any number of frames.
//
//   2. The CHECK is a checksum of the encoded bytes rather than per-channel
//      levels. There is no decoder in this profile to reconstruct with - that
//      is the whole point of it - so what a run can say is that the same input
//      produced the same bitstream it produced on the host. See kExpected below
//      for what that does and does not establish.
//
// It also answers a fourth, since 2026-09-10: how long each frame took, on
// exactly probe.cpp's terms (<codec>.us_per_frame and realtime_permille
// against a 32 ms frame) and with exactly its caveats - see report_timing
// below for what the number is worth on each leg.
//
// The output is machine-readable (`key=value` lines) so the CI leg can gate on
// it; tools/checks/run_baremetal_probe.sh parses the same lines for either
// direction.

    // 7.1 as an ACCESS UNIT: an independent 5.1 substream and a dependent
    // carrying Ls, Rs, Lrs and Rrs (chanmap k71Rear), which is how Annex E
    // codes a layout wider than 5.1 (E3.8.2) and the shape libs/ac3/tests/encoder/
    // test_eac3.cpp's seven_one() builds. Two FrameEncoders live at once
    // inside the AccessUnitEncoder, and that is the finding: on the host this
    // fixture takes the run's peak from about 223,000 bytes to 435,263, and
    // on an ESP32-S3 (QEMU, same memory map, 2026-09-10) it dies on a
    // 73,728-byte request with 303,656 bytes free and a largest block of
    // 241,664 before the run began. A 7.1 E-AC-3 encode does not fit this
    // part's internal SRAM; PSRAM is the question that remains, and QEMU
    // cannot ask it.
    //
    // Opt-in (-DICLFORGE_PROBE_SEVEN_ONE=ON) for exactly that reason: a default
    // fixture that cannot pass on one leg is not a fixture, and the two legs'
    // heap ceilings are statements about what fits. Off, the block is
    // discarded and the image is the one the ceilings hold.
    //
    // Ten spans over six channels of PCM: the dependent's four alias the
    // bed's L, R, SL and SR. The encoder does not care that two substreams
    // see the same samples, and widening g_pcm to ten channels would add
    // 24 KB of .bss to an image whose whole subject is footprint.
