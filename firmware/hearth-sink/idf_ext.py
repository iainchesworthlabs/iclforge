"""idf.py ota: push this example's build to boards over the network.

ESP-IDF v6.1's idf.py loads idf_ext.py from the project directory and adds the
actions its action_extensions() returns, once they carry a "version" (without
one, idf.py warns that it cannot load the extension and goes on without it:
tools/idf_py_actions/tools.py, merge_action_lists). This adds `ota`, which runs
tools/hearth/ota.py push on the build directory with the Python that runs
idf.py, so a build and an update are one command, as `build flash` is over USB:

    idf.py -C <this directory> -B <build dir> ... build ota --host hearth-eb2c64.local

--host names a board by its IP address or its mDNS name; repeat it for
several, which are updated one at a time. --yes stops a board that is playing
without asking, and --force pushes to a board that already runs the image.
`ota` runs after `build` or `app` when either is on the same command line, and
builds nothing itself. ota.py makes every check and prints every outcome
(planning/esp32-ota.md); a non-zero exit status from it fails the idf.py run.
