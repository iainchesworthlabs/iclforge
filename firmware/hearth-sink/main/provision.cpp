// The console is shared with everything the player prints, which is what the
// specification's serial transport is: a client picks its packets out of
// whatever else the device is saying. Written in one fwrite so a packet does
// not interleave with a printf from another task.
//
// Then synced as well as flushed. On the S3's USB-Serial-JTAG console (the
// board shapes' sdkconfig.hw), fflush only hands the bytes to the peripheral,
// which sends its buffer to the host at a newline, and a packet carries none:
// the answer to a client's request sat there until the board next printed a
// line, which on an idle board, or after cannot_connect, was never.
//
// These bytes are not text, and the console must not treat them as text.
// ESP-IDF converts line endings both ways by default: a CR goes out before
// every LF, and a CR that arrives becomes an LF. Either one rewrites a length
// byte, a string or a checksum inside a packet, which then fails its checksum
// at the other end - a board could not be given a network named
// "MyHomeNetwork", thirteen characters, because the length byte in front of
// it is a CR; and an answer carrying a ten-character name, whose length byte
// is an LF, left broken. sdkconfig.defaults asks for LF in both
// directions, which is no conversion at all, and the comment there has the
// measurements; tools/checks/run_improv_qemu.sh holds the board to it.
//
// And not text for GET /log either, which keeps the console's lines
// (iclforge/log.hpp).
