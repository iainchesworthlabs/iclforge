// Where decoded audio goes, as a seam CMake resolves rather than a flag the
// code branches on - the same rule the library follows for its own platform
// choices (tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1, and the arch/ and profile/
// directories under src/internal/).
//
// Four implementations, one chosen per build:
//
//   sink/i2s/      the real one for a part whose I2S TDM frame is 128 bits
//                  (the ESP32-S3, the ESP32-C6). Standard I2S or TDM,
//                  reconfiguring its own mode and slot count to whatever a
//                  layout needs (up to a hardware ceiling -
//                  iclforge/sink_plan.hpp), across one or two of the part's
//                  I2S lines.
//   sink/i2s_wide/ the same arithmetic for a part whose one controller
//                  reaches the product's full channel target alone, at a
//                  wider frame (512 bits on the ESP32-P4) - never a second
//                  line, see that directory's own top-of-file comment.
//   sink/capture/  converts exactly as the real ones do and checks the
//                  result; what CI runs.
//   sink/null/     counts what it is given and returns.
//
// The last two stand in for a peripheral qemu-system-xtensa does not have:
// with a real sink the first write blocks on a DMA that never drains and the
// job times out. Neither is a stub that skips the work - each is a SINK,
// called exactly as often and with exactly the same audio, so the player and
// its timing arithmetic are still exercised. What they cannot do is prove a DAC
// makes a noise, and nothing running without hardware can.
//
// Selected in Kconfig (main/Kconfig.projbuild), read by main/CMakeLists.txt.
// Not by C++: the player does not know which sink it has, which is the point.
//
// --- WHY THE INTERFACE IS PLANAR FLOAT --------------------------------------
//
// Because interleaving and sample format are the SINK's business, and the sinks
// do both differently.
//
// Standard I2S carries one or two slots. Anything wider out of an ESP32-S3
// means TDM (driver/i2s_tdm.h): one data line packs at most 128 bits a frame -
// 4 slots at 32 bits - and the real sink reconfigures between the two modes
// itself as the layout asks for more or fewer channels (iclforge/sink_plan.hpp),
// rather than a build picking one mode and staying there. The DAC has to
// speak whichever it gets; a PCM3168A speaks TDM, a SigmaDSP does on its
// serial inputs, the common stereo breakouts (MAX98357A, PCM5102) do not.
//
// TDM mode wants 24-bit samples in 32-bit slots, as many as the bus has.
// Standard mode wants one or two slots of 16 or 32 bits. If this interface
// carried interleaved int16_t - as it did for about an hour - reconfiguring
// between them would have meant changing the seam, and changing a seam is how
// the implementations behind it drift apart. Handing over planar float and
// letting the sink convert costs one pass over the samples
// (iclforge/interleave.hpp) and settles the question.
//
// --- WHAT A WRITE IS ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// One BLOCK: one span per output slot of the player's layout, each
// iclforge::ac3::kSamplesPerBlock (256) samples or fewer, six times a frame. A block
// rather than a frame because that is what the decoder's block form hands
// over and what keeps a sixteen-slot layout's storage at 16 KB rather than
// 96 KB - see firmware/esp-idf/iclforge/include/iclforge/player.hpp.
//
// --- NOTES THE REAL SINK'S TDM MODE WAS WRITTEN FROM -------------------------
//
// Still untested against a TDM DAC, so still worth keeping in one place.
//
//   * Slots are FIXED WIDTH. A 5.1 layout on an 8-slot bus has to write zeros
//     into slots 6 and 7 every block, not leave them; whatever was in the DMA
//     buffer last time is what the DAC will otherwise clock out, which is
//     digital noise on two channels nobody is watching.
//
//   * 24-bit in 32-bit slots is the usual arrangement, so the conversion is to
//     int32_t, not int16_t. Sixteen slots of 32 bits at 48 kHz is a 24.6 MHz
//     bit clock, inside what the S3 will do; whether the DAC follows is its
//     datasheet's business.
//
//   * The driver caps a DMA descriptor at 4,092 bytes and quietly shortens one
//     that asks for more. The two I2S sinks size their descriptors from the
//     bus width (sink/sink_common.hpp) so the configured depth survives.
//
//   * i2s_channel_write COPIES into the driver's own descriptors, so the
//     buffer handed to it does NOT need MALLOC_CAP_DMA. That requirement
//     belongs to the zero-copy paths (i2s_channel_preload_data, or taking the
//     DMA buffer directly). Reaching for heap_caps_malloc here would put an
//     allocation into a decode path this profile exists to keep free of them -
//     a static array in .bss is internal SRAM already, and with PSRAM off there
//     is nothing else it could be.
//
//   * The interleave is unlikely to be worth vectorising, and PIE is a trap
//     worth naming. Roughly 12,000 stores per 32 ms frame at 8 channels is
//     under 1% of a 240 MHz core, and the S3's PIE does no floating-point
//     ARITHMETIC at all (docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md) - so it could only help the
//     integer shuffle after conversion, which is not where the time goes. The
//     decode is the cost, and it is still unmeasured on hardware. Measure
//     before optimising this.

// `channels` is how many slots the sink will be given per write - the

//
// Callable more than once: the real sink reconfigures its mode and slot count
// to whatever `channels` needs (iclforge/sink_plan.hpp), between plays, so a

// caller that keeps a layout open against the old one must re-check it.
