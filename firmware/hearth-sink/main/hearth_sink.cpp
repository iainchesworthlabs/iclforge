// Decode AC-3 or E-AC-3 from wherever the bytes are and play it onto whatever
// speakers the room has - the wiring around iclforge::Player, which is where
// the work happens.
//
// The difference between this and the i2s_player example beside it is where the
// audio comes from, and that difference is the entire point. That one decodes a
// bitstream linked into its own image, which is fine for showing the codec
// works and is not how anything real gets its audio. This one never has the
// whole stream in memory: a fetch task reads it in blocks from wherever it is,
// a ring buffer holds what has arrived, and a decode task on the other core
// frames it with iclforge::ac3::io::AccessUnitAccumulator, decodes whatever complete
// access units come out a block at a time, renders each block onto the
// configured layout and writes it to the sink.
//
// Both tasks, the ring and the decoders are the component's
// (firmware/esp-idf/iclforge/include/iclforge/player.hpp), and so is the control surface
// (control.hpp) that lets something on the network say what to play and onto
// what; the layout and the renderer are the library's
// (libs/render/include/iclforge/render/layout.hpp, render.hpp). What is left here is
// what an integrator's own firmware would have to write too: the seams,
// adapted; a level meter; a command queue between the HTTP server's task and
// this one, which owns the player; and the reporting.
//
// BOTH ENDS ARE SEAMS, and CMake resolves both - see byte_source.hpp and
// audio_sink.hpp. This file mentions neither a partition nor I2S.
//
//   source/partition/  flash. The default, and the first one CI runs.
//   source/fatfs/      a FAT volume in flash; the SD source's file layer, runnable.
//   source/sd/         an SD card over SDMMC.
//   source/http/       an HTTP body, over WiFi or QEMU's Ethernet.
//
//   sink/i2s/          an I2S DAC, standard or TDM, reconfigured to whatever
//                      the layout needs.
