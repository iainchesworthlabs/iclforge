// An SD card, over SDMMC, through FATFS.
//
// COMPILED BY CI, NOT RUN. QEMU has no SD host, so nothing here is exercised
// without a board - which is why it is deliberately small: the less that lives
// behind an unrunnable seam, the less can be wrong in it. What CI does
// establish is that it builds against the current IDF, which is the failure
// that would otherwise be found by an integrator rather than by us.
//
// SDMMC rather than SPI. The ESP32-S3 has an SD host peripheral and 4-bit mode
// is several times faster than SPI, which matters less for one AC-3 stream
// (448 kbit/s is nothing) than it does for the CPU: SPI mode bit-bangs through
// the driver, and this player would rather spend its cycles decoding.
