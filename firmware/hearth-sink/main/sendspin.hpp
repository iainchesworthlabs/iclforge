// The board as a Sendspin player (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, B3), as
// a seam CMake resolves, like the source and the sink:
//
//   sendspin/player/  the component's Sendspin player
//                     (firmware/esp-idf/iclforge/include/iclforge/sendspin_host.hpp and
//                     burst_player.hpp), for a build with a network and
//                     CONFIG_ICLFORGE_SENDSPIN;
//   sendspin/none/    everything else, where each of these does nothing.
//
// A server connects to the board, pairs with it and plays to it: bursts over
// _iclforge_player@v1 from hearth, PCM over player@v1 from Music
// Assistant. The player owns the sink while a stream plays; a play from the
// control surface (POST /play, kept for debugging) owns it otherwise, and the
// two never run at once.
//
// sendspin_start() is app_main's. The rest may be called from any task: the
// control surface's, the console's, app_main. Until the player has started they
// find no player, and it has started only once its server has too.
