// Counts blocks and returns. CI builds this sink and does not run it: its QEMU
// steps use sink/capture/, which converts the samples and checks them.
//
// qemu-system-xtensa has no I2S peripheral, so the real sink's first write
// blocks on a DMA that never drains. This one lets everything else run - the
// source reads, the access-unit framing, the decode, the player loop - on the
// target, under the emulator, with no board.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it does not pace the player's own plays. The real sink
// blocks until the DAC has taken the samples, which is what makes the player
// run at real time and what makes its us_per_frame figures mean something. Here
// the loop runs flat out, so a run under this sink says the decode is CORRECT
// and says nothing whatever about whether it is FAST ENOUGH. See
// docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md on why QEMU cannot answer that either way.
// A Sendspin stream's timed writes are the exception, below.
