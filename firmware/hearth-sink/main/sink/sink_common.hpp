// What the I2S sink needs and does not share with anything else: the shape
// of the DMA queue. The mode/slot-count planning it also needs is
// iclforge/sink_plan.hpp, in the component rather than here, because that
// part is pure enough to host-test the same way interleave.hpp and
// dac_queue_model.hpp already are - this file has no path into tests/
// CMakeLists.txt's include list, and gaining one for a single function
// would be more infrastructure than moving the function.

namespace player {

// --- the DMA queue's shape ------------------------------------------------------
// Kconfig gives a depth as descriptors x frames (main/Kconfig.projbuild), sized
// for stereo. The driver caps a descriptor at 4,092 bytes and quietly shortens
// one that asks for more, so eight 32-bit slots at the stereo default of 240
// frames would silently get 127 and a queue a quarter as deep as configured.
// This keeps the DEPTH - the product - and splits it into as many descriptors
// as the bus width needs.
//
// And each descriptor DIVIDES a write, so no write ever ends part-way through
// one. ESP-IDF v6.1's i2s_channel_write starts a fresh buffer whenever two or
// more sent buffers are already waiting for the writer, and whatever it had
// not yet written of the one in hand goes out as it stands - zeros, with
// auto_clear. A write that ends mid-descriptor therefore turns into silence
// whenever the next one is a little late: measured on a DevKitC-1, 1,536-frame
// writes into 240-frame descriptors paced at 35 ms a frame instead of 32, the
// extra three milliseconds being the unwritten 144 frames of every seventh
// buffer. The player writes one 256-frame block per call, so a descriptor of
// 128 frames (stereo) or 64 (12 TDM slots) always ends exactly where a write
// does.
