// The control surface: a few HTTP verbs over the player, for the ESP-IDF
// integrator whose controller is not Home Assistant. planning/esp32-player.md
// (Control) says why it is REST here and a media_player entity on ESPHome.
//
//   GET  /            a web page that shows what the player is doing and drives
//                     it through the routes below and nothing else, with its
//                     script at GET /ui.js. Both are sent from flash as the
//                     component embeds them (planning/esp32-device-ui.md).
//   GET  /api         the routes, as text
//   GET  /status      what is playing and how it is going, as JSON
//   GET  /hardware    what this board IS - the chip, its revision, whether it
//                     has an FPU and PSRAM, this sink's own ceiling, and the
//                     firmware running on it - as JSON, gathered once at
//                     startup rather than on every request: unlike /status,
//                     nothing in it changes while the board runs.
//                     planning/esp32-device-ui.md says why this is a route of
//                     its own rather than part of /status.
//   POST /play        body: the location to play - a URL for the HTTP source,
//                     a path for a file source. 202 when accepted (the owner
//                     opens it on its own task; /status says how that went),
//                     409 when the source cannot take a location, 400 when the
//                     body is empty.
//   POST /stop        200
//   POST /volume      body: a number 0.0 to 1.0. 200, or 409 if the sink has
//                     no volume to set.
//   GET  /layout      the output layout, as text: a name or a speaker list
//                     (ac3/render/layout.hpp)
//   PUT  /layout      body: a name or a speaker list. Takes effect at the next
//                     play. 200, 400 when it is not a layout, 409 when the
//                     sink's bus has fewer slots than it needs.
//   GET  /pairing     the servers a Sendspin player is paired with, as JSON:
//                     each one's server_id and name, whether it is connected,
//                     and which last played. 404 with no player.
//   POST /pairing     body: reset, cancel or forget, for a board that is a
//                     Sendspin player; or forget, a space and a server_id
//                     from GET /pairing, for that one server alone. 200, 400
//                     for another body, 404 for a server_id the board has no
//                     pairing with, 409 with no player.
//
// And the board's own settings, which ControlHandlers lists: GET and PUT
// /name, /slot-width and /wiring, and PUT /network.
//
// And updates over the network, which Control hands to the owner's Firmware
// (firmware.hpp, planning/esp32-ota.md): GET and PUT /firmware, PUT
// /firmware/mode and /firmware/rollback, and POST /restart. In flash mode
// every route that would play something or change a setting answers 409.
//
// Every handler below runs on esp_http_server's task. Nothing here touches a
// Player: the callbacks hand the request to whichever task owns the player -
// a queue, in the streaming example - and answer from what that task
// publishes. The one exception is `stats`, which is a snapshot the Player
// already makes safe from any task.
