// forwards here, flash mode, the upload into the slot that is not running,
// the trial of an image an update wrote, and the report of all of it.
//
//   GET  /firmware           what each slot holds, the trial, an upload's
//                            progress, how the last update ended, and the
//                            partition table as the board has it, as JSON
//                            (firmware_status.hpp)
//   PUT  /firmware           body: an application image. Enters flash mode,
//                            writes the other slot, checks it and restarts
//                            into it
//   PUT  /firmware/mode      body: flash, or normal (a restart into the image
//                            that runs now)
//   PUT  /firmware/rollback  the other slot's image boots next; restarts
//   POST /restart            restarts into the image that runs now
//
// The owner supplies what only it knows through FirmwareHooks: how to stop
// everything that plays, what the trial waits for, the names the board
