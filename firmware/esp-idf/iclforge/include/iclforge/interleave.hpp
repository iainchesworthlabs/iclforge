// Planar float to interleaved fixed-point, in the two shapes the sinks need.
//
// In the component rather than in an example, because every sink converts
// through it - the streaming example's I2S and TDM sinks, its capture sink,
// and whatever an integrator writes - and free of ESP-IDF, because this is the
// part of a sink that can be TESTED. Everything else in one is peripheral setup
// and a blocking write, neither of which does anything without a DAC on the
// other end; this is arithmetic and indexing, and indexing is where the bugs
// are. libs/ac3/tests/io/test_interleave.cpp builds it on the host.
//
// It is library code with a temporary home: planning/esp32-player.md hands it
// over to libs/ac3 as iclforge::ac3::io::interleave, and this copy goes when that lands.
//
// SLOTS ARE FIXED WIDTH AND MUST ALL BE WRITTEN. A TDM frame carries `slots`
// samples whatever the programme has, so a 5.1 stream on an 8-slot bus has two
// slots with nothing to put in them. They are ZEROED, not skipped: the DMA
// buffer is reused, so whatever the previous frame left in slots 6 and 7 is what
// the DAC clocks out next time - two channels of stale audio that nobody is
// listening for and everybody can hear.
//
// TWO WAYS TO CONVERT A SAMPLE, ONE CHOSEN PER PART. to_pcm16 and
// to_slot_24in32 scale, clip and truncate in float: a handful of instructions on
// a part with a floating-point unit, such as the ESP32-S3, and four calls into
// the software floating-point routines on a part without one, such as the
// ESP32-C6. to_pcm16_from_bits and to_slot_24in32_from_bits (at the bottom of
// this file) compute the same integers from the float's IEEE-754 bits with
// integer operations only. Every interleave here takes the conversion as a
// template argument, FloatConversion or BitConversion, and defaults to
// SlotConversion, which iclforge/slot_conversion.hpp names. There are two copies
// of that header, under conversion/float/ and conversion/bits/, and the
// component's CMakeLists.txt puts one of them on the include path from
// CONFIG_SOC_CPU_HAS_FPU. A sink calls interleave_16in16 and gets its part's
// conversion; the host tests name each one.

// --- The same two conversions from the float's bits --------------------------
//
// For a part with no floating-point unit. The results are to_pcm16's and
// to_slot_24in32's for every float that is not a NaN - all 4,278,190,082 such bit
// patterns were compared on the host - and a NaN gives 0, where the float forms
// convert a NaN to an integer, which C++ leaves undefined.
//
// What the float forms compute. A finite float is M x 2^(E - 23), with M its
// 24-bit mantissa (the stored 23-bit fraction and the implicit leading one) and
// E its unbiased exponent. `sample * kScale` is the exact product
// P = M x (2^b - 1), in units of 2^(E - 23), rounded to 24 significant bits to
// nearest with ties to even: IEEE-754's default rounding, which a
// single-precision multiply does in hardware and in a software library alike (b
// is 15 for a 16-bit slot, 23 for 24-in-32). The comparisons then clip at the
// scale, and the cast truncates toward zero. Taking the cases in turn:
//
//   - |sample| >= 1, an infinity included, is at or past full scale and clips.
//     Below 1 the rounded product never reaches the scale: the largest float
//     under 1 gives 32767 - 2^-9 at 16 bits, which truncates to 32766.
//   - |sample| < 2^(-1 - b) gives a product under a half, which truncates to 0,
//     as do zero and the subnormals.
//   - Between the two, the integer is P rounded at the float's last place and
//     shifted down by 23 - E. For that integer, rounding to nearest with ties to
//     even is the same as adding half of the last place: the two differ only on
//     a tie whose kept part is even, and rounding such a tie up could only change
//     the integer by carrying through every bit from the last place to the units,
//     where the last place holds a zero. The last place follows from the length
//     of P, which is 24 + b bits when the stored fraction is at least
//     ceil(2^23 / (2^b - 1)) - 257 at 16 bits, 2 at 24 - and 23 + b bits
//     otherwise. With A = P >> (b - 2) = 4M - ceil(M / 2^(b - 2)), which is exact
//     and fits in 26 bits, the integer is (A + 2) >> (25 - b - E) for the longer
//     product and (A + 1) >> (25 - b - E) for the shorter: 32-bit shifts and
//     additions and one comparison, with no multiply.
//
// Leaving the rounding out does not give the same integers: truncating the exact
// product comes out one step nearer zero for 33,278 of the 16-bit inputs and
// 8,388,608 of the 24-in-32 ones, those whose product lies less than half of the
// float's last place below an integer, where the multiply rounds up onto it.
