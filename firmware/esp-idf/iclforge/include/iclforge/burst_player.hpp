// The Sendspin player's audio (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, B3): what
// the server sends arrives here with the time it should play, and leaves for
// the sink at that time.
//
//   _iclforge_player@v1's bursts (planning/hearth-sendspin-extension.md, Burst
//   chunks) are decoded, AC-3 or E-AC-3 with any object layer, and rendered
//   onto the board's layout by iclforge::render;
//   player@v1's PCM, which is what Music Assistant sends, is rendered onto the
//   same layout as a stereo or mono bed.
//
// Either way each block is then routed to the sink's outputs, trimmed and
// delayed per output (iclforge::render::Routing and TrimDelay), replaced by the
// identify tone while one plays, metered, scaled by the player's volume, and
// handed to a Playout, which writes it so that its first frame leaves the
// audio port when the server said.
//
// ONE TASK DOES THE WORK. The Sendspin session's task only copies each chunk,
// with its local time, into a ring - PSRAM where the part has it - and the
// decode task takes them in order, so a slow decode never holds up the
// network. Stream starts, clears and ends travel through the same ring, so
// they take effect exactly between the chunks they came between; a clear or
// an end also drops whatever the ring still holds from before it.
//
// A chunk that could not play in time is dropped before it is decoded
// (late_chunks), and so the next is decoded as the start of a stream. What
// the decoder hands over for a unit it held back (§3.7) is placed by the
// unit's own time: every decoded frame is counted from the stream's start,
// and each burst's time says where its frames go.
//
// Settings from the server - layout, routing, trims, delays, the crossover
// and the decoder's own - are checked when they arrive and applied by the
// decode task at the next burst boundary.
