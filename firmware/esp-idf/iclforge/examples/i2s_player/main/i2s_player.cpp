// Decode AC-3 and play it out of an I2S DAC.
//
// The smallest thing that is actually a player rather than a measurement: it
// takes the 5.1 fixture testdata/baremetal/fixture.hpp already carries, folds it to
// stereo with the decoder's own §7.8 output stage, and writes 16-bit frames to
// an I2S peripheral in a loop. Flash it at a MAX98357A, a PCM5102 or any other
// I2S DAC and it makes a noise.
//
// WHY THIS IS AN EXAMPLE AND NOT PART OF THE PROBE. firmware/baremetal/probe.cpp is
// a measuring instrument whose numbers CI holds to ceilings; adding a
// peripheral, a DMA buffer and a playback loop to it would move every one of
// those numbers and measure something nobody asked about. This is the other
// half - what the decoder is FOR - and it is kept where an integrator can copy
// it.
//
// IT ALSO ANSWERS THE OPEN QUESTION. Whether this part decodes in real time is
// unmeasured, and QEMU cannot say: it is not cycle-accurate and reports a CPU
// clock that disagrees with its own boot log (docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md). On
// hardware, I2S is a clock - the DMA drains at exactly 48,000 frames a second
// whatever the CPU is doing - so a decode that cannot keep up underruns
// audibly, and the numbers this prints are from silicon rather than from an
// emulator. That is why it counts and reports the margin rather than only
// playing.
