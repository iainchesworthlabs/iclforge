# ICL Forge as an ESP-IDF component

Dolby Digital (AC-3) and Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) decoding for the ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3,
ESP32-C6 and ESP32-P4 (the manifest's targets), and encoding, which only the S3 has run, in the
library's minimum-footprint profile: a static archive built without exceptions or RTTI, sized to
run out of internal SRAM with no PSRAM. The decode arithmetic is `float` on a part with a
floating-point unit and fixed point on one without. On a part with a floating-point unit and
PSRAM the component can also decode AC-4, behind `CONFIG_ICLFORGE_AC4` ([AC-4](#ac-4)): the
ESP32-P4 has run it on a board, and the ESP32-S3 under QEMU.

This directory is the component. For the codec it is a wrapper: `CMakeLists.txt` pre-seeds the
repository's options, `add_subdirectory()`s the repository root and links `iclforge::ac3_minimal`,
so the library is built from the same target definitions every other platform uses and nothing
here can drift from `libs/ac3/minimal.cmake`. What it adds of its own is the layer that cannot
live in the library because it is made of FreeRTOS:

- **`iclforge::Player`** ([`include/iclforge/player.hpp`](include/iclforge/player.hpp)): a fetch
  task reading a `ByteSource` into a ring buffer, a decode task draining it through the
  incremental framer and both decoders a block at a time, rendering each block onto the
  configured speaker layout, and a `PcmSink` taking one block of planar float per output slot.
  The layout, the fold, whether to reconstruct objects, cores, priorities, the ring's size and
  whether it sits in PSRAM are `PlayerConfig`. It reports frames, decode time, the worst frame,
  how low the ring ran, and why a run ended. An integrator implements the two seams for their
  transport and their DAC and gets the rest.
- **`iclforge::Control`** ([`include/iclforge/control.hpp`](include/iclforge/control.hpp)): a REST
  surface over whatever owns a player - `GET /status`, `GET /hardware`, `POST /play` with a
  location, `POST /stop`, `POST /volume`, `GET`/`PUT /layout` - on `esp_http_server`, with
  callbacks the owner supplies so the server's task never touches the player itself. The board's
  own settings (`/name`, `/slot-width`, `/wiring`, `PUT /network`), a Sendspin player's pairings
  (`/pairing`) and updates over the network (`/firmware`, `/firmware/mode`, `/firmware/rollback`,
  `/firmware/coredump`, `POST /restart`, and the console's recent output at `GET /log`) go
  through the same server. `GET /` is a web page for the routes, and the only client they need:
  the state, the stream, the layout, the volume and the decode's timing, and the four actions,
  from two files in [`ui/`](ui) sent from flash as they are
  ([`planning/esp32-device-ui.md`](../../../planning/esp32-device-ui.md)). `GET /api` lists the
  routes.
- **`iclforge/interleave.hpp`**: planar float to interleaved 16-bit or 24-in-32 with slot padding,
  free of ESP-IDF and tested on the host. It and the other headers of the component that need no
  ESP-IDF (the sink planner, the playout and DAC queue models, the firmware image rules, Improv,
  the pairing records) are the host-portable library [`libs/device`](../../../libs/device); this
  component puts its include directory on its own, so they are included by the names they always had.
- **`iclforge::DacQueueModel`**
  ([`iclforge/dac_queue_model.hpp`](../../../libs/device/include/iclforge/dac_queue_model.hpp)): what an I2S
  DAC heard, worked out from the one fact the hardware guarantees - its DMA drains at exactly
  the sample rate. A sink tells it when each block arrives and when its write has returned, by a
  clock the sink passes in, and it counts, per play, the blocks that arrived to an empty queue,
  how long the queue was dry, and the least that was left. The streaming example's `i2s` and
  `i2s_wide` sinks keep one each for their `sink.*` line. Free of ESP-IDF and tested on the host
  against a simulated DMA (`libs/device/tests/test_dac_queue_model.cpp`).

The player renders through the library's `iclforge::render` headers, which began in this component
and moved to `libs/render/include/iclforge/render/` so that the desktop player and its test sink render
with the same code ([`planning/hearth-reference-player.md`](../../../planning/hearth-reference-player.md)).
**`iclforge::render::OutputLayout`**
([`layout.hpp`](../../../libs/render/include/iclforge/render/layout.hpp)) is the speakers a player has, one
per slot, from a name (`2.0`, `5.1`, `7.1.4`, `9.2.4`) or a speaker list (`L,R,C,LFE,Ls,Rs`, or
angles). **`iclforge::render::LayoutRenderer`** ([`render.hpp`](../../../libs/render/include/iclforge/render/render.hpp))
turns the decoder's block - the coded channels and, when the stream has them, the objects with
their positions - into one block per slot: a stereo or mono layout is the decoder's own §7.8
fold; anything else has the bed placed channel by channel through `iclforge::spatial::pan_direction`,
and a layout with height speakers has the objects placed by their own positions instead. Both
are tested on the host (`libs/render/tests/test_layout.cpp`).

`idf_component.yml` is the registry manifest, and it is not published yet — see
[the CI workflow](../../../.github/workflows/esp-component.yml) for why the publish job is gated.

## Using it

Two lines in a project's top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, both **before** the include of
`project.cmake`, because the component is read during IDF's component scan:

```cmake
set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS "/path/to/iclforge/firmware/esp-idf")   # the directory CONTAINING components
set(ICLFORGE_ESP_PROFILE "decoder")                      # or "encoder"
include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)
```

The two profiles are mutually exclusive: no two of decode, AC-3 encode and E-AC-3 encode fit in
this part's internal SRAM at once. Switching needs `idf.py fullclean` first, since the choice
reaches the library as CMake cache variables a warm build directory has already resolved.

Packed for the component registry, the archive carries `libs/ac3` and `cmake` inside this
directory, staged by [`tools/packaging/pack_esp_component.py`](../../../tools/packaging/pack_esp_component.py);
the component's own CMake finds the library either way.

## AC-4

`CONFIG_ICLFORGE_AC4` (`idf.py menuconfig`, off by default) builds the AC-4 inspector, core and
decoder into the component, in single precision on a part with a floating-point unit and in the
fixed-point tier on one without, and lets the player read a stream that opens with an AC-4 sync word: the same ring,
renderer and sinks, and `iclforge::ac4::SyncFrameSplitter` and `iclforge::ac4::Decoder` in place of the AC-3 and
E-AC-3 framer and decoders. With it off the component builds as it always did. It needs PSRAM,
since the decoder alone peaks at 286 KB of heap at 2.0 and 1.50 MB at 5.1.4 on the footprint
probe's streams, and a decode task with a stack of 40 KB, which `firmware/hearth-sink/sdkconfig.ac4`
sets: the decoder uses 19 to 30 KB of it. The [ESP32-P4 page](../../../docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-p4.md#ac-4) has what a stream of
each kind held and how fast it decoded on a board: 2.0 and 5.1 streams in SIMPLE, A-SPX and A-CPL mode 2
in real time, A-CPL mode 3 and 5.1.4 slower. On the ESP32-S3 an AC-4 play puts the decoder's state in
PSRAM: `CONFIG_ICLFORGE_AC4_INTERNAL_BELOW`, 512 bytes on that part and ESP-IDF's own limit on any
other, is the size below which its allocations try internal RAM first, and the player sets it for the
length of the play only. The S3 decodes the footprint probe's streams under QEMU with the PCM equal to
the pins, and has not been timed on a board
([ESP32-S3](../../../docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md#ac-4)). It builds for the ESP32-C6 and the ESP32-C3,
which have no PSRAM; 2.0 is level with what a C6 has free beside WiFi with WiFi's code in flash
([ESP32-C6](../../../docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-c6.md#ac-4)), and more than a C3 has. No sink built on the
component takes AC-4 in a Sendspin group. A component archive carries the AC-4
sources only when it was packed with `pack_esp_component.py --with-ac4`.

## The examples

| Example | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [`examples/i2s_player`](examples/i2s_player/README.md) | Decodes a fixture linked into the image and plays it out of an I2S DAC, printing per-lap timing from the DAC's own clock. The measurement anyone with a board can repeat. |
| [`firmware/hearth-sink`](../../hearth-sink/README.md), beside the component and naming it as its dependency | Bytes from a flash partition, an SD card, a FAT volume in flash or an HTTP body over WiFi, through the incremental framer, rendered onto a configured layout - stereo, 5.1, 7.1.4 with the objects placed - to an I2S or TDM DAC; a `capture` sink for CI. With `sdkconfig.sendspin` it is a Sendspin player that takes updates over its network. How a real player gets its audio. |

Both are built by CI under `espressif/idf:v6.1`, in the `esp` lane of `ci.yml`, which runs after a
merge to main that changes the ESP32 trees or a tree its component ships, and nightly
([the lane table](../../../docs/ci-lanes.md#lane-table)). `hearth_sink` runs under QEMU there in seven
shapes, one of which renders a height-object stream onto 7.1.4 and checks every slot's level
against the footprint probe's. Timing figures come only from a board: QEMU is not cycle-accurate.

## On a board

The examples ask for 240 MHz in their `sdkconfig.defaults`; ESP-IDF's own default is 160, and a
decode that has to finish inside a 32 ms frame should name the clock it was measured at. On an
`ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1` reached through its native USB connector, add each example's
`sdkconfig.hw` overlay (`SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.hw"`) so the console
comes out of the same cable, and expect the USB-Serial-JTAG reset trap: every host-initiated
reset lands in `boot:0x0 (DOWNLOAD)` and the application never starts, so flash, press the
board's RESET button, then attach with `idf.py monitor --no-reset`. Building several shapes on
one machine, give each its own build directory and its own `-DSDKCONFIG=<build dir>/sdkconfig`.

## Where this is going

[`planning/esp32-player.md`](../../../planning/esp32-player.md) is the plan for what the component
should carry beyond the library for a player — buffering and tasks, the source and sink seams,
a control surface — and for the ESPHome component that sits on it. The platform page,
[`docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md`](../../../docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md), has the footprint and timing figures
and what the port required from the library.
