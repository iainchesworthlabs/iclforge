// The plumbing, not a player.
//
// This owns the two things any ESPHome integration of iclforge needs and that
// are awkward to own from a media_player: a decoder, and the streaming framer
// that turns arriving bytes into whole access units. Another component feeds it
// bytes and takes PCM back; nothing here touches an output device, because
// which device is not this component's business.
//
// See __init__.py for what is deliberately absent.

// The component's namespace is esphome::iclforge, so the library's is written ::iclforge:: here.
