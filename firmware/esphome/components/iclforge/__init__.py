"""iclforge as an ESPHome external component.

What this does and does not do, because the difference matters to anyone reading
the YAML.

DOES: pull the iclforge ESP-IDF component into the build, and expose a small C++
object that owns a decoder and the streaming framer, so another component can
feed it bytes and get PCM back.

DOES NOT: implement a media_player or a speaker source. ESPHome's `speaker`
platform is ESP-IDF-only, so the frameworks are compatible and that is the
obvious next step - but it is a component in its own right, and shipping the
plumbing first is what lets it be built against something that already works.

The library is fetched as a GIT dependency rather than from the ESP Component
Registry, because iclforge is not published there yet (see
.github/workflows/esp-component.yml for why that is deliberately not armed).
ESPHome's add_idf_component writes `git:`, `version:` and `path:` straight into
the generated idf_component.yml, which is exactly the form the IDF component
manager wants for a component living in a subdirectory of a repository.
