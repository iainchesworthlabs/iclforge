// The real-audio fixture every member of the performance suite is fed, and
// the frame-at-a-time view the whole-frame benches read it through.
//
// This exists because the suite's three producers had drifted apart on the
// one question that decides whether their numbers mean anything: what goes
// in. kernel_bench.cpp had the rule right from the start ("every kernel is
// fed REAL audio ... this project's own validation rule - silence and frame
// 0 give false passes on correctness checks - applies just as much to timing
// here"), while iclforge-bench and iclforge-perf ran a 440 Hz sine on every channel.
//
// A single stationary tone is not a cheaper version of programme material,
// it is a different workload: its spectrum is one bin wide, so the SNR
// offset search converges against an allocation almost nothing competes
// for, coupling has near-nothing to share between channels, rematrixing
// sees a pair that is already identical, and the transient detector never
// fires, so the block-switched transform never runs at all. A regression
// confined to any of those paths could not move the number. Feeding the
// same reference_51.wav the gold-reference and kernel numbers already use
// puts all of them back in the measurement.
//
// Header-only and shared by iclforge-bench, iclforge-perf and iclforge-kernelbench so the
// three cannot drift again: one loader, one fixture, one set of rules about
// what a missing or too-short file means (exit, never fall back to
// synthetic audio - a bench that silently substitutes a tone is worse than
// one that does not run).

// A WAV's channel order (FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR) is not A/52 Table 5.8's
// (L, C, R, SL, SR, LFE), and feeding it through unpermuted would put a
// full-bandwidth channel where the encoder expects the LFE - which is not
// just wrong, it is wrong in a way that changes the cost: the LFE's coded
// bandwidth is 7 mantissas against a full channel's 253. ac3_layout_for()
// is the same permutation the CLI's encode path uses.
//
// The fixture is 2.5 seconds - 78 whole frames - and the benches run 200,
// so frame indices wrap. Wrapping keeps every frame real audio instead of
// padding the tail with silence (which would make the back three quarters
// of the run measure the cheapest possible workload); the seam it creates
// between the last frame and the first is one transient in 200, and it
// lands in exactly the same place on every run, so it costs the series
// nothing in comparability.
