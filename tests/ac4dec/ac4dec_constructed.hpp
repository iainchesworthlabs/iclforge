// Streams of the channel elements DEE's streams do not reach, built for the
// decoder's tests: the 3.0 element, the 5.X element in every coding_config
// and 2ch_mode, and the 7.X element in its three channel modes, in the SIMPLE
// and ASPX codec modes (ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1 clause 4.2.6); the channel
// pair, 5.X and 7.X elements in the A-CPL modes; the immersive element of
// the 7.X.4 modes (ETSI TS 103 190-2 V1.3.1 clause 6.2.4) in its five codec
// modes, every core_5ch_grouping and 2ch_mode, with step 4's and Table 20's
// parameters; and the 22.2 element (clause 6.2.4.3) in SIMPLE and ASPX. Each
// output channel carries a tone of its own, so a channel coded in the wrong
// place shows as its tone in the wrong channel.
//
// The immersive element's tracks are the tones worked back through what full
// decoding does to them, by the text: S-CPL's Table 23, A-CPL's Pseudocode 2 or
// A-JCC's Pseudocode 8 with constant parameters that route whole signals, then
// Table 20's prediction and step 4 undone, and Table 19's assignment. So each
// tone comes back on its own channel only where the decoder reads those as
// printed; core decoding puts it on the core's channel of its pair.
//
// In the A-CPL modes the parameters are constant: alpha 1 in every band, which
// sends each module's downmix to its first output and leaves the second
// silent, or -1, the other way round, with beta 0; ASPX_ACPL_1's residuals
// carry the second outputs below acpl_qmf_band 8 (3 kHz), above every tone.
// ASPX_ACPL_3 routes L and R's downmixes to L and R, or Ls and Rs, by gamma1
// and gamma4 (and alpha 1 or -1). The tracks are the tones worked back through
// Pseudocodes 115 to 120 as printed, with Table 202's pairs for the 7.X
// element, so the decoder must read those as printed for the tones to come
// back where they started.
//
// They are written with the encoder's writer (src/ac4enc/src): its audio
// spectral frontend coder, chparam_info(), companding_control() and A-SPX
// writers, and its frame writer. The element syntax around those, and where
// each channel goes (Tables 180, 182 and 183), are written here, a
// transcription separate from the decoder's routing (src/ac4dec/src/pcm/
// routing.cpp). Where stereo processing mixes tracks, the tracks are the
// channels through the inverse of the printed matrix (ac4dec_printed_matrices.
// hpp), so the decoder's matrix must be the printed one for the tones to come
// back where they started. A-SPX data are one FIXFIX envelope per channel,
// loud with noise for one aspx_data element and silent for the others, so the
// channels A-SPX fills show which element the decoder gave them.
