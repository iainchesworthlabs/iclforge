// Admission between the servers connected to one client (connection.md, Multiple servers
// (server-initiated)): which connection the client holds, which it rejects, and which one an
// incoming connection displaces.
//
// A client holds one admitted connection, ranked by the highest activity it declares: playback
// above pairing above none. A connection is provisional until its first admissible
// server/activate, whose rank is compared with the holder's: equal or higher is admitted and
// displaces the holder, lower is rejected. Three exceptions: a pairing attempt in progress is
// not displaced by incoming playback or pairing; when neither declares anything, the incoming
// one is admitted only if it comes from the last-playback server and the holder does not; and
// one incoming pairing connection is held beside a playback holder, then arbitrated against it
// as if incoming once it drops pairing. Later activations change a connection's rank without
// arbitration.
//
// The arbiter only decides. Its owner makes the sessions act on the verdicts - a rejected
// session refuses its activation, a displaced one is told to leave with
// PlayerSession::displace() - and persists last_playback(). It has a lock of its own, so the
// sessions' listeners may call it from any thread.
