class SendspinTimeFilter;

// A client's side of Sendspin's clock synchronisation (messaging.md, Clock Synchronization):
// client/time out, server/time back, and the time filter that maps server time to local time
// and back.
//
// Exchanges run in bursts, as the time filter's Recommended Usage describes: a burst sends
// kBurstLength exchanges one after another, each waiting for its reply, and feeds the filter
// only the sample with the smallest max_error. Until the clock has converged the bursts follow
// one another at once. The next kLearningBursts run kLearningInterval apart, since the bursts
// before them all came within a second or two and say little about drift; after that one runs
// every kBurstInterval. A reply that has not come within kReplyTimeout ends the burst with the
// samples it has.
//
// Once converged, a burst whose best sample has a max_error well above the least of the last
// kFloorBursts bursts' (floor_limit()) is left out of the filter. Measured on ESP32-S3 boards
// over Wi-Fi, the replies to a player that is being sent a stream wait behind its chunks: every
// sample of a burst can then come back several milliseconds late, and the filter would take
// that one-sided delay for a change of offset. Every burst counts towards the floor, so a
// network that has become slower for good is followed once the window has passed.
//
// The filter's own error estimate says how well its samples agree with each other, not with
// the truth, and bursts before convergence follow one another at once - so a run of exchanges
// taken in the seconds right after a Wi-Fi reconnect, where reassociation, mDNS's re-announce
// and an ARP round can all delay a reply the same way, can agree with each other as tightly as
// a run of accurate ones and read as converged regardless. Convergence is therefore taken in
// two steps: once the error estimate has stayed under kConvergedError for kConvergedUpdates
// updates in a row (planning/hearth-sendspin-extension.md, Q4), one more burst - a learning
// interval later, so genuinely apart in time from the run before it - must measure within
// kConvergedError of that run's own last raw measurement, not the filter's error estimate
// again, before the filter counts as converged. A run whose confirming burst disagrees is not
// the truth catching up with a stale estimate; it starts over. A player reports available: true
// only once converged.
//
// Every time is a local monotonic microsecond count the caller passes in; nothing here reads
// a clock. The filter itself ignores any update not later than its starting point of zero, so
// local times reach it counted from just before the first exchange, and come back out of it
// on the caller's scale: a clock that reads negative works like any other.
