// Runs one session over one transport::Connection on a computer. A reader thread hands the
// session each frame that arrives; a writer thread sends what the session answers, in the order
// the session produced it, and ticks the session when its timers are due. The owner's own calls
// go through call(), so the session sees one caller at a time, as PlayerSession and
// ServerSession require.
//
// Sending happens outside the session's lock, so a slow peer holds up only its own writer. What
// waits to be sent is bounded: a peer that stops reading until more than max_queued_bytes are
// waiting is disconnected, and an owner that paces audio reads queued_bytes() first.
//
// A session's listener callbacks run inside the driver's calls, on the driver's threads with
// the session's lock held. They must not call call() on the same driver, which would deadlock:
// an owner that answers an event, such as activating a client once its hello arrives, does so
// from a thread of its own.
//
// Drivers can share one lock. A client's sessions share its pairing state, which the owner
// serialises every call on them for, so a player gives all its drivers the same lock; a callback
// then must not call call() on any of them.
//
// A board has no driver: its WebSocket handler calls the session directly.
