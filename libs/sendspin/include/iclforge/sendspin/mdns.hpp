// The discovery seam's backend on a computer: DNS-SD over IPv4 mDNS with mjansson's mdns.
//
// Each uses one socket on UDP port 5353 per interface, so it answers and announces on every
// network the computer is on with that network's own address, a VMware or VPN adapter beside
// the LAN included. Answers follow RFC 6762: multicast unless the question asked for unicast,
// and the legacy unicast form for a query from a port other than 5353. An advertiser announces
// twice on start and says goodbye when destroyed; a browser queries at 1 s, 2 s, 4 s and so on
// up to once a minute, asks for the SRV, TXT and A records a response left out, and expires
// what it learnt by the records' TTLs.
//
// Not implemented: probing for a unique name (RFC 6762, section 8), so instances on one network
// need distinct names, which a friendly name usually gives; and IPv6.
//
// Each advertiser and browser runs a thread of its own. A browser calls its listener on that
// thread.
