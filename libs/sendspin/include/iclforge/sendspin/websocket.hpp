// The transport seam's backend on a computer: Sendspin's plain ws:// WebSocket over
// cpp-httplib (connection.md, Establishing a Connection). The spec lets either side dial,
// so both halves need both directions: a player that advertises _sendspin._tcp listens and
// the server dials it, and a server that advertises _sendspin-server._tcp listens for the
// players that dial it. Listener accepts; connect() dials.
//
// Every connection keeps transport.hpp's threading contract, and on top of it:
//   - a receive() in progress returns within ConnectionOptions::poll_interval of a close()
//     from another thread, whether or not the peer answers the Close frame;
//   - an accepted connection may outlive its Listener: stop() ends it, and afterwards its
//     receive() returns nothing and its sends fail.
//
// An accepted connection holds one of the Listener's worker threads until it ends, since
// cpp-httplib keeps each WebSocket on the worker that upgraded it. A dialled one holds no
// thread of its own. Each also has cpp-httplib's ping thread while ConnectionOptions::
// ping_interval is non-zero.
