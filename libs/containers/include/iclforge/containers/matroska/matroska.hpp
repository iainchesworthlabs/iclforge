// A minimal Matroska (MKV) muxer, per the EBML and Matroska specifications.
//
// This is a container writer and nothing more: it knows how to nest EBML
// elements and lay out clusters, and it takes each frame as opaque bytes. It
// has NO dependency on iclforge::ac3 and no knowledge of AC-3 - which is the
// point of keeping it a separate library. A caller muxing E-AC-3 hands over
// whole access units; a caller muxing something else hands over whatever its
// own frames are.
//
// Deliberately small. Enough to produce a file a player will open with the
// right channel layout and duration:
//   - one audio track,
//   - one SimpleBlock per frame, clusters closed on a time budget,
//   - Info carrying TimestampScale and Duration.
// No SeekHead, no Cues, no chapters, no tags. Those matter for seeking in
// large files, not for playing back what this project produces.

// to be streamable, so this needs no invention: Segment is written with
// EBML's own reserved "unknown size" pattern (a size vint whose value bits
// are all ones), the standard way a streamed Matroska declares a length it
// cannot know yet - real players (and other streaming muxers, e.g. a live
// WebM recording) already handle this. Duration is omitted from Info for the
// same reason - there is nothing to put in it yet. Everything else - Tracks,
// cluster layout, SimpleBlock framing - is identical to mux().
//
// No more than one cluster's worth of frames (`options.cluster_ms`, a second
// by default) is ever held at once, so a caller streaming push()'s returned
// bytes straight to disk keeps memory bounded for a session of any length -
// the property mux() cannot offer, since it needs the whole frame list
// resident to call it at all.
