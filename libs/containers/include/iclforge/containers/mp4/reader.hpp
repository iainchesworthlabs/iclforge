// The read side of iclforge::containers::mp4::mux()/iclforge::containers::mp4::fragment(): pulling
// one audio track's samples back out of an MP4, plain or fragmented.
//
// A container reader and nothing more, in the sense mp4/mp4.hpp's writer is a
// container writer and nothing more: it walks ISOBMFF boxes, finds the
// 'ac-3'/'ec-3'/'ac-4' track, and hands each sample back as opaque bytes. It links
// nothing from iclforge::ac3. The one place MP4 forces a codec-shaped decision on
// this module is the same place the writer already had one - the sample
// entry's dac3/dec3 configuration box - and CodecConfig below is where that
// lands: the read twin of iclforge::ac3::io::build_codec_config_box (ac3/io/dec3.hpp),
// parsed here because the box is an ISOBMFF structure the walk is already
// standing on, and reported as plain numbers for a caller that knows what
// they mean.
//
// Two shapes, mirroring the write side, over one box walker:
//
//   demux()  - batch, and ZERO-COPY: samples come back as spans into the
//              caller's buffer. Reads a file whose moov sits either side of
//              mdat, since it can reach any offset.
//   Reader   - incremental, for a file too big to hold: push() chunks in,
//              samples come back through a callback. Needs moov BEFORE mdat
//              (the "faststart" layout mux() and fragment() both write); a
//              moov-last file is kMoovAfterMdat, because locating a sample
//              means seeking backwards and a stream cannot.
//   demux_seekable() - the same bounded memory for a source that CAN be read
//              at an offset: the boxes first (mdat jumped over), then each
//              sample where the table says. Reads a moov-last file a stream
//              refuses.
//
// UNTRUSTED INPUT. Every box length, chunk offset and sample size in an MP4
// is self-declared, and the sample table is an INDEX - a hostile stsc can
// point a chunk past the end of the file, an stsz can claim four billion
// samples, and boxes can nest until a recursive walker's stack gives out.
// ReadOptions bounds each of those, the walk is iterative, and every sample
// range is checked against the data actually present rather than trusted.
// libs/containers/fuzz/fuzz_mp4_demux.cpp drives the walker with arbitrary bytes.
