// Decoded-domain distortion measurement for the encoder's own candidates.
//
// The encoder's only in-loop quality criterion has been the composite SNR
// offset step 9 maximises, and that number answers a narrower question than
// it looks like it does: it is the largest offset at which the frame still
// FITS. Two candidate parameter sets are only comparable through it when
// they produce the same masking curve, because the offset is measured
// against that curve rather than against the signal. Change dbpbcod, or an
// exponent strategy, or a delta segment, and the curve moves under the
// number - so "this candidate reached a higher offset" stops meaning "this
// candidate sounds better", and every search built on it either measures
// nothing (the per-frame BitAllocCodes search) or loses (the cost-based
// exponent-strategy dynamic program). Both were tried and both are recorded
// as dead ends in encoder.cpp for exactly this reason.
//
// What is missing is a criterion in the units the listener is served in:
// how much error the DECODER will reconstruct. That is computable here
// without a decoder, because the encoder already holds every input to it -
// the coefficients, the decoded exponents (§8.2.10's mirror rule guarantees
// they are the decoder's), and the bit allocation pointers it just derived.
// A/52 §7.3's quantizers are deterministic functions of those three, so the
// reconstruction error is too.
//
// This header computes that error exactly, in the coefficient domain the
// encoder's MDCT output already lives in, banded onto §7.2.2.3's own 50
// bands so the result lines up bin-for-bin with the allocator it is judging
// and band-for-band with the delta bit allocation segments (§7.2.2.6) that
// can correct it.
//
// EXACTNESS. accumulate_block() does not call quantize_mantissa() and
// dequantize_mantissa(); it evaluates their composition in closed form, as
// an integer residue plus one scaling, which is roughly an order of
// magnitude cheaper per bin and is what makes a per-candidate measurement
// affordable inside the encoder's frame loop at all. That is a duplicated
// arithmetic model of the kind this project has been bitten by before (see
// ac3/verify/mirror.hpp), so it is pinned by an exhaustive equivalence test
// rather than by inspection: libs/ac3/tests/quality/test_distortion.cpp sweeps every
// bap against the real quantize/dequantize pair and requires bit-exact
// agreement, over the full mantissa range, at every exponent.
//
// SCOPE. This measures the quantizer, which is what a parameter search
// chooses between. It does not measure the coupling channel's decoupling
// error, spectral extension's regenerated band, or rematrixing - each of
// those is a different decision with a different candidate set, and folding
// them into one number here would price them all at once. A caller that
// wants them measures the streams it wants and sums.
