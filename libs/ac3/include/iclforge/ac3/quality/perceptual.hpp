// A psychoacoustic model for the AC-3 encoder's transmitted knobs.
//
// WHY THERE IS ONE AT ALL. A/52 §7.2.2's bit allocation is a masking model,
// but it is a masking model built from the exponents alone: psd[bin] is
// 3072 - (exp << 7) and nothing else, so two bands with the same energy get
// the same treatment whether one is a held violin note and the other is
// cymbal wash. That is not a defect of the format - the routine has to be
// reproducible bit-for-bit inside every decoder, so it can only use what is
// transmitted - but it does mean the ENCODER is the only side that can know
// the difference, and this encoder has never computed it. Nothing
// psychoacoustic existed in the tree before this file: no tonality
// estimate, no spreading, no absolute threshold, no perceptual entropy.
//
// What the encoder can do about it is bounded and specific. It can move the
// whole curve (csnroffst/fsnroffst), change its shape globally
// (BitAllocCodes - dbpbcod's knee, fgaincod/sgaincod's leak rates), or
// correct it per band by up to +-3 steps (§7.2.2.6 delta bit allocation).
// This model exists to price those choices: it produces, per band, the
// noise power that band can actually hide, which iclforge::ac3::quality's measured
// reconstruction noise can then be compared against.
//
// THE MODEL. Johnston's perceptual-entropy formulation (J. D. Johnston,
// "Transform Coding of Audio Signals Using Perceptual Noise Criteria",
// IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications 6(2), February 1988,
// pp. 314-323), with the tonality estimate taken from the unpredictability
// measure of ISO/IEC 11172-3:1993 Annex D.2 (MPEG-1 psychoacoustic model
// 2). Concretely, per band:
//
//   1. Band energy over A/52 Table 7.13's own 50 bands - deliberately the
//      codec's banding rather than a separate critical-band partition, so
//      that a threshold lands exactly where a delta bit allocation segment
//      can act on it and in the same bands iclforge::ac3::quality::BandNoise
//      measures.
//   2. Tonality from inter-block spectral unpredictability (Annex D.2.4):
//      this block's magnitude spectrum against a linear extrapolation of
//      the previous two, normalised. Steady tones extrapolate well and
//      score near 1; noise and transients do not and score near 0.
//   3. Spreading across bands by Schroeder's function (M. R. Schroeder,
//      B. S. Atal, J. L. Hall, "Optimizing digital speech coders by
//      exploiting masking properties of the human ear", JASA 66(6), 1979,
//      pp. 1647-1652), over Bark distances from Zwicker and Terhardt's
//      analytical expression (JASA 68(5), 1980, pp. 1523-1525).
//   4. A signal-to-mask requirement interpolated between the tone-masking-
//      noise and noise-masking-tone limits by tonality, as Johnston §II.
//   5. An absolute threshold of hearing floor (Terhardt's approximation),
//      optional and off-by-default-able, because this project has already
//      been caught once by a change that scored well precisely because it
//      discarded high frequencies (see encoder.cpp's chbwcod comment).
//   6. Perceptual entropy per block, Johnston §III - an estimate of the
//      bits needed to code the block transparently, which is the number
//      that says whether a frame is tight or comfortable independent of
//      the rate table.
//
// WHAT IS APPROXIMATE, AND WHY IT IS SAID OUT LOUD. Annex D.2.4's
// unpredictability is computed on a complex FFT spectrum, using magnitude
// AND phase. This encoder has an MDCT, which is real; its coefficients
// carry phase as sign in a form that does not linearly extrapolate. What is
// implemented is therefore the magnitude half of that measure, on a
// three-bin smoothed magnitude - smoothed because a stationary sinusoid's
// MDCT magnitude is modulated block to block by time-domain aliasing, and
// an unsmoothed per-bin magnitude would call a held note unpredictable.
// The published model is not being claimed here; a documented reduction of
// it is. libs/ac3/tests/quality/test_perceptual.cpp pins the behaviour that matters
// - tones score tonal, noise and clicks do not.
