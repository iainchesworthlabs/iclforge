// Turning a BYTE STREAM into whole access units, without owning any memory.
//
// iclforge::ac3::split_frames and iclforge::ac3::split_access_units both take a span over the
// entire stream and hand back every boundary in it at once. That is the right
// shape for a file that is already in memory and the wrong one for anything
// arriving over time: an HTTP body, an SD card read in blocks, a UART, a flash
// partition read a page at a time. None of those can be spanned before the last
// byte has arrived, and on a part with 280 KB of RAM the whole stream is not
// going to be in memory anyway.
//
// This is the same boundary rule, applied incrementally. The caller owns the
// storage and drives the loop:
//
//     std::array<std::byte, 16384> buf;
//     iclforge::ac3::io::AccessUnitAccumulator acc{buf};
//     for (;;) {
//         auto unit = acc.next();
//         if (unit.status == Status::kNeedMoreInput) {
//             const auto n = read_from_somewhere(acc.writable());
//             if (n == 0) { acc.finish(); continue; }
//             acc.commit(n);
//             continue;
//         }
//         if (unit.status != Status::kUnit) break;   // kEndOfStream or an error
//         decoder.decode_access_unit_into(unit.bytes, channels);
//     }
//
// WHY ACCESS UNITS AND NOT SYNCFRAMES. Because that is what the decoder takes.
// Eac3Decoder::decode_access_unit_into wants an independent substream together
// with the dependents that extend it (§E3.8.2), and handing it one syncframe at
// a time would lose exactly the grouping it needs. For AC-3 the two are the
// same thing, so a caller that only ever sees AC-3 pays nothing for the
// distinction.
//
// NO ALLOCATION, ANYWHERE. The storage is the caller's span and nothing here
// grows it - which is what lets this be used from the minimum-footprint profile
// (minimum-footprint decoder profile) whose whole subject is not allocating during decode. The cost
// of that choice is that the buffer has to be big enough for the largest access
// unit in the stream, and the caller finds out it was not by getting
// kBufferTooSmall rather than by silently reallocating. See kMinimumBuffer.

namespace iclforge::ac3::io {

// The largest a single syncframe can be: E-AC-3's frmsiz is 11 bits and the
// frame is (frmsiz + 1) * 2 bytes, so 4,096. AC-3's worst case is smaller -
// 640 kbit/s at 32 kHz is 3,840 - so this covers both.

// header, which is what deciding where an access unit ENDS requires - the
// boundary is only known once the following frame's strmtyp has been read.
//
// It is only enough for a stream whose access units are ONE syncframe: plain
// AC-3, or E-AC-3 with no dependent substreams. An Atmos access unit is an
// independent substream plus its dependents and needs the sum of them, so a
