// What a stream IS, as opposed to what it sounds like.
//
// Everything else in this project that reads an elementary stream reads it in
// order to do something with the audio: decode it, measure it, wrap it in a
// container. This reads it in order to describe it - the question a pipeline,
// a bug report or a CI gate asks first, and the one nothing here could answer
// without decoding the whole file and inferring backwards from the result.
//
// Two passes' worth of information, taken in one walk:
//
//   - the header tier, from io::read_frame_header. Bounded, cheap and
//     independent of the decoder, so a syncframe whose AUDIO is unreadable
//     still reports its bsid, layout, rates and substream identity truthfully.
//     A CRC check rides alongside it for the same reason.
//   - the parse tier, from the real decoders run with
//     DecoderConfig::skip_reconstruction. This is what dynrng words, EMDF
//     payload ids, the OAMD/JOC object layer and the per-block tool usage
//     come from, and it costs the parse but not the transform.
//
// A frame the parse tier refuses is counted, reported and walked past - the
// header tier's answers for it stand. That is deliberate: an inspection tool
// is at its most useful on exactly the stream that does not decode.
//
// Memory is flat in the length of the stream. The report holds counters,
// ranges and one entry per substream IDENTITY - never per frame - and
// per-frame detail is handed to a callback as the walk reaches it rather than
// accumulated. AccessUnitReader below extends that to the input side, so a
// caller need not hold the file either.
