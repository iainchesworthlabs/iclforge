// Named loudness/true-peak delivery gates a decoded stream's measurement can
// be checked against (`forge qc`). Each preset
// states a target integrated loudness, how that target is enforced, a true
// peak ceiling, and the document/clause/date it was read out of - see
// qc_preset()'s own comment on each case for the exact wording cited; every
// number here was read out of the primary document, not recalled from memory.
//
// Deliberately the same shape iclforge::ac3::meta::Profile/ProfileId (drc.hpp) uses for
// the §7.7.1 DRC profile table: a small enum naming the presets, a constexpr
// accessor returning the numbers, and a name<->id parser - so a caller
// (forge qc, and the GUI's own QC panel) reads one table instead of
// hand-copying the same magic numbers more than once.
//
// Three specifications considered for this table are deliberately NOT in it,
// because adding them would mean shipping a second name for a verdict already
// on offer:
//
//   * EBU R 128 s4 "Loudness Normalisation of Cinematic Content" (Geneva,
//     November 2023). Its recommendation (m) normalises Programme Loudness to
//     "a Target Level of -23.0 LUFS" and defers tolerances to R 128 itself,
//     and its recommendation (l) repeats the -1 dBTP ceiling - so numerically
//     it IS ebu-r128-s2 below. What s4 adds that R 128 does not have is
//     recommendation (j), a Loudness-to-Dialogue Ratio "not exceed[ing] 5 LU"
//     - a Programme-minus-Dialogue Loudness figure, and LoudnessMeter has no
//     dialogue gate, so the one clause that would distinguish an s4 preset is
//     also the one clause this meter cannot evaluate.
//
//   * Netflix "Dolby Atmos Home Mix Deliverable Requirements" v2.3. Its
//     loudness spec is "-27db LKFS +/- 2 LU 1770-1 dialog-gated" with peaks
//     that "should generally not exceed -2dBFS true-peak", which is exactly
//     the kNetflix row below. What it adds is scope, not numbers: "Loudness
//     and peaks should be measured via a 5.1 rerender." That is a choice of
//     what to meter rather than what to compare against, so it belongs to
//     `forge qc`'s own layout= switch, not to a preset.
//
//   * Amazon. Figures for Prime Video delivery are widely repeated at
//     -24 LKFS/-2 dBTP, but every source found for them is a third-party
//     summary; Amazon's own delivery specifications sit behind a partner
//     portal. Nothing here is cited to a document that was not read, so this
//     row is absent rather than guessed - and -24/+/-2/-2 would in any case
//     restate kAtscA85.

namespace iclforge::ac3::meta {

// How a preset enforces its loudness target. Most delivery specs state a
// target to hit and a symmetric tolerance around it; a distribution platform
// that normalises on playback instead states only a level not to exceed, and
// quieter content is compliant however quiet it is. Gating a ceiling as a
// band would fail material the specification actually accepts, so the two
// cases are distinguished rather than approximated.
