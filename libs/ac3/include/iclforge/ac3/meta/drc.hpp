// Dynamic range metadata — A/52 §7.7.
//
// Two control signals with genuinely different jobs, so this file generates
// them from different measurements rather than deriving one from the other:
//
//   dynrng (§7.7.1) sits in audblk, so it resolves to a block (5.3 ms). Its
//   job is "subjectively pleasing dynamic range reduction" — an RMS-detected
//   compressor riding a static curve anchored at dialogue level, with attack
//   and release slow enough that the gain itself is inaudible.
//
//   compr (§7.7.2) sits in bsi, so it resolves only to a syncframe (32 ms).
//   Its job is an assured peak ceiling in the MONO DOWNMIX, for links that
//   overmodulate rather than merely sound loud. §7.7.2.1 is explicit that
//   dynrng gives "no assurance that it will control instantaneous signal
//   peaks", which is why compr cannot be a rescaled dynrng: it is driven by
//   the true peak of the §7.8 downmix, not by programme RMS, and it attacks
//   instantaneously, because a ceiling met one frame late is not a ceiling.

// compression to dialogue rather than to full scale.
