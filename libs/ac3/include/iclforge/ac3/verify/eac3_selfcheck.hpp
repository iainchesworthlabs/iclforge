// The encode-then-decode-then-compare driver over ac3/verify/eac3_mirror.hpp,
// and the E-AC-3 counterpart of ac3/verify/selfcheck.hpp.
//
// Eac3MirrorEncoder is a drop-in for eac3::AccessUnitEncoder that
// additionally decodes every access unit it emits with this repo's own
// decoder and diffs the decoder's model against the encoder's own. It is a
// debugging and test facility, not a production encode path: it costs a full
// decode per access unit on top of the encode. AccessUnitEncoder itself is
// untouched by using this - the trace pointer eac3::FrameConfig now carries
// is null unless something like this class sets it, and a null trace means
// one predictable branch per block and no allocation.
//
// The access unit, rather than the syncframe, is the unit here because that
// is what an E-AC-3 encoder produces: a 7.1.4 program is an independent
// substream plus two dependents, all coding the same 1536 samples, and a
// check that looked at one substream at a time would have nothing to say
// about the ones beside it. Each substream is decoded on its own
// (Eac3Decoder::decode_substream) rather than through decode_access_unit,
// because what is being compared is what each side PARSED, and the §E3.8.2
// render that decode_access_unit adds on top is downstream of every field
// the trace records.
