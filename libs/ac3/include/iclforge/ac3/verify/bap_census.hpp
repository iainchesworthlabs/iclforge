// How many bins each coded stream gave zero bits to, counted over a whole
// decode.
//
// This exists to make a masked comparison honest, and it has to land BEFORE
// one. tools/checks/compare_wav.py measures agreement between two decoders
// over every bin, which means the bins the encoder spent nothing on - where
// §7.3.4 lets a decoder substitute "any reasonably random sequence" and two
// correct decoders are therefore REQUIRED to differ - are inside the
// measurement, and on a 5.1 fixture they dominate the surround channels. The
// obvious fix is to exclude them and score only what was actually coded.
//
// The trap in that fix is that the mask would come from the decoder under
// test. If a bit-allocation misread made this decoder believe a bin was
// bap == 0 when the stream allocated it bits, the unmasked comparison catches
// it - we would dither a bin that should carry audio, and the SNR falls - but
// a masked comparison would EXCLUDE that bin precisely because the wrong bap
// said to, and report an improvement. That is the class of defect the
// external-baseline fixtures exist to catch (verify_gold_reference.sh lists
// five real ones; firstcplcos[ch] is per channel by nature), so a mask that
// can swallow it is worse than no mask.
//
// So the population of bap == 0 bins is itself pinned. A decoder bug that
// shifts the allocation shows up here as "this stream now gives zero bits to
// a different share of its bins than every previous run did" - a direct,
// binary statement about the allocation rather than an inference from a
// changed SNR, and a much sharper signal than the SNR was ever going to be.
//
// Counts, not fractions, are what accumulate; fractions are derived on the way
// out. A count is exact and comparable, and dividing early would lose the bin
// total that says how much evidence each figure rests on.
