// E-AC-3 encoder/decoder mirror verification - Annex E's counterpart to
// ac3/verify/mirror.hpp, which this deliberately parallels rather than
// extends.
//
// The reasoning is the AC-3 one, only more so. An encoder carries a model of
// the decoder it writes for, every mantissa field's WIDTH comes out of that
// model, and the moment the two copies disagree the shared bit stream stops
// being parseable somewhere downstream of the field that actually diverged.
// What Annex E changes is how much model there is and how little else checks
// it:
//
//   - There is strictly more of it. Exponent strategies and coupling-in-use
//     are hoisted to a frame-level audfrm element, the adaptive hybrid
//     transform packs a whole frame of one stream's mantissas into block 0
//     under its own allocation table and gain-adaptive quantizer, spectral
//     extension replaces a band with per-band scale factors, enhanced
//     coupling replaces a per-band scale factor with an amplitude/angle/
//     chaos triple, and a program can be split across an independent
//     substream and its dependents.
//   - There is less to check it against. docs/verification.md's own table:
//     FFmpeg reads no enhanced coupling and no transient pre-noise syntax at
//     all, refuses a second dependent substream (so 7.1.4 has no external
//     oracle), and refuses fscod2 audio - as, on the same streams, does
//     Dolby's Reference Player. For those the in-repo round trip is the only
//     check there is, and a round trip cannot see a misreading of the spec
//     that BOTH sides share.
//
// That last case is what this closes. A shared misreading produces identical
// audio on both sides and an identical bit layout, so no round trip and no
// SNR gate can see it - but the two sides reach that layout through
// independent code, and comparing the intermediate model is what makes the
// agreement mean something. Where they part company for any other reason,
// the per-block bit offset localises it exactly as it does for AC-3.
//
// Nothing here is on by default: a trace is written only where an
// eac3::FrameConfig/DecoderConfig carries a non-null pointer to one, so an
// ordinary encode or decode pays one null test per block and no allocation.
// See ac3/verify/eac3_selfcheck.hpp for the encode-then-decode-then-compare
// driver most callers actually want.
