// Encoder/decoder mirror verification.
//
// An AC-3 encoder carries a model of the decoder it is writing for: the
// exponents that decoder will reconstruct, the bit allocation it will derive
// from them, the delta correction it is holding. Every mantissa field's WIDTH
// comes out of that model, so the moment the two copies disagree the shared
// bit stream stops being parseable - not visibly, and not at the field that
// diverged. Each side keeps reading confidently at its own idea of where it
// is, and the failure surfaces some blocks later as whatever §7.10.2 guard
// the misaligned bits happen to trip first. The bug that motivated this
// (deltbaie == 0 read as "no delta" instead of "keep the previous block's",
// §5.4.3.47) presented as "exponent walks outside 0..24" two blocks
// downstream, in a different channel, and was investigated in the wrong file
// for it.
//
// So rather than adding another guard for another symptom, this compares the
// two models directly. Both sides record what they believed, per block, into
// a FrameTrace; compare() diffs them and names the first block where they
// part company.
//
// The bit offset at each block boundary is the check that does most of the
// work. It is one number per block, it needs no agreement about WHY the sides
// differ, and it catches every desync there is - any disagreement about a
// field's width, whatever caused it, shows up as an offset delta at the next
// block boundary. The per-stream exponent/bap/delta comparison is what turns
// "block 3" into "block 3, channel 1, delta segments", and it runs first at
// the block where the offsets are still equal, which is where the CAUSE lives
// rather than where the damage shows.
//
// Nothing here is on by default: a trace is written only where an
// EncoderConfig/DecoderConfig carries a non-null pointer to one, so an
// ordinary encode pays one null test per block and no allocation at all. See
// ac3/verify/selfcheck.hpp for the encode-then-decode-then-compare driver
// most callers actually want.
