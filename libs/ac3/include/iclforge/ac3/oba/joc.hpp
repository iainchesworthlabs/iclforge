// Joint Object Coding - ETSI TS 103 420 clause 6. The tool that gets more
// objects out of a decoder than there are channels in the bitstream.
//
// JOC codes no audio of its own. It carries a matrix: for each output object,
// how much of each downmix channel to take, per QMF parameter band and
// interpolated across the frame. The decoder (§6.6.6) computes
//     object[obj] = sum over channels of downmix[ch] * mix[obj][ch]
// in the complex QMF domain, so the "matrix" is really a set of per-band
// gains, and the whole tool is 5 channels in, up to 16 objects out.
//
// Because the reconstruction is a linear combination of the downmix, objects
// that were mixed into the SAME downmix channels with the same gains cannot be
// pulled apart again. JOC is a parametric approximation, not a lossless
// separation, and its quality depends entirely on how well-separated the
// objects were in the downmix.

// --- Audio reconstruction -----------------------------------------------

// Domain and reconstruction_delay() live in ac3/oba/joc_domain.hpp.

// §6.6.6's reconstruction runs in the 64-band complex QMF of §7.1, and
// iclforge::dsp::QmfAnalysis/QmfSynthesis is that filterbank. Domain::kQmf runs
// it there, which is what every licensed decoder does and therefore the
// only domain in which a matrix this encoder estimates means the same thing
// on the other side.
//
// Domain::kMdctBand is the path that predates the filterbank: the same
// per-band linear combination applied in the 512-sample MDCT domain. It
// stays because it is cheaper and because a stream whose matrix was
// estimated in that domain reconstructs best there - but it is an
// approximation twice over. The MDCT is critically sampled and real, so its
// subbands only behave like subbands while neighbouring blocks agree on
// what was done to them; a per-band matrix that changes every frame breaks
// that time-domain alias cancellation and leaves the residue in the output.
// And its 256 bins map to §7.1's 64 subbands only four-to-one, so the
// matrix's time resolution is the 256-sample block rather than the QMF's
// 64-sample timeslot.
//
// Carried frame to frame for one program's worth of reconstruction, the same
// way Eac3Decoder's own overlap-add delay_ is: `bed_history` gives block 0 of
// each frame real pre-roll instead of zero-padding across the frame seam,
// and `object_history` is each object's own overlap-add tail. `previous_*`
// is what §6.6.5's ramp interpolates FROM; a shape mismatch against the
// frame just decoded (object or channel count) is treated exactly like
// FrameParameters::seq_count == 0 - no ramp, this frame's matrix applies to
// the whole frame outright - since there is nothing meaningful to ramp from.
//
// §6.6.5 keeps joc_mix_mtx_prev per QMF SUBBAND rather than per parameter
// band, which is what lets an object change its band count from one frame to
// the next and still ramp; `previous_matrix` follows it, sized
// objects * channels * kQmfSubbands.
//
// One state object serves either domain, and only the members that domain
// uses are ever touched; `qmf` in particular stays null until a kQmf call
// allocates it, so a decoder that never leaves the MDCT path carries none
// of the filterbank's own state.
// The scalar reconstruction carries its state in.
//
// float, in every build, and not decode_scalar_t. It is the same argument the
// decoders' coefficient stores made - single-precision is all the target
// hardware has and all the arithmetic needs - plus two this type has and they
// do not:
//
//   - ReconstructionState is INSTALLED. src/ac3/include/ ships wholesale and
//     joc::reconstruct is exported, so an external caller declares one of
//     these. decode_scalar_t lives in a header deliberately never installed,
//     being a fact about how the library was built rather than part of its API;
//     putting it in a shipped struct's layout would make a build variant part
//     of the ABI.
//   - The size is why the type is being changed at all. At double this struct
//     is 147,504 bytes in ONE allocation - larger than the biggest contiguous
//     block an ESP32-S3 has free after any other decode, so it fails on
//     contiguity before any budget is consulted. A variant that is only smaller
//     in some builds does not answer that.
//
// reconstruct() takes and returns float on both sides already, so nothing about
// the API boundary moves; only what happens behind it. The accuracy cost is
// measured rather than assumed - tests/ac3/oba/test_atmos.cpp pins this
// reconstruction against the direct form and against the objects that went in.

//
// `bed` must be exactly `params.channels` channels of one frame's samples
// each - kSamplesPerFrame ordinarily, or 256/512/768 for a §E2.3.1.4 short
// syncframe; the frame length is taken from the spans themselves and must be
// a whole number of 256-sample blocks. Channels are in Table 53's JOC
// channel order (L, R, C, Ls, Rs, and for a 7-channel downmix a further pair
// at positions 5/6 - Lb, Rb for kDmxConfig7X, or Tfl, Tfr for
// kDmxConfig5XPlus2/kDmxConfig5XPlus2PhaseShift; Table 53 itself is generic
// on POSITION, keyed only by joc_num_channels - it is Table 47 that says
// which physical channels occupy 5/6 for a given joc_dmx_config_idx) - NOT
// AC-3's Table 5.8 order (L, C, R, Ls, Rs); the caller permutes, the same
// permutation atmos.cpp's AtmosEncoder applies on the way in (see its
// kAc3FromJoc). Returns one waveform per object, `params.objects` of them,
// each the bed's own length, in the SAME order
// build_payload's own `objects`/matrix rows use - which, for a program this
// project's own AtmosEncoder produces (dynamic-object-only with a bypassed
// LFE, no bed), is exactly oba::DecodedProgram::objects' order too. An
// object whose ObjectShape says it is absent this frame comes back silent.
// Spans rather than vectors so the caller's permutation into JOC order is
// a pointer shuffle, not a channel copy.
//
// Table 47's two "90 degree phase shift" configurations are reconstructed
// like their unshifted siblings: the shift belongs to how the downmix was
// BUILT (it buys a better legacy stereo fold-down), and §6.6.6 says nothing
// about undoing it before matrixing. There is no Hilbert filterbank here to
// undo it with either. Confirmed against the actual ETSI TS 103 420 V1.2.1
// text, not just inferred from its silence: §6.6.1-6.6.6's full decode
// pseudocode (Pseudocode 2 through 7) has no branch, flag or note keyed on
// joc_dmx_config_idx anywhere - Pseudocode 7's reconstruction sum is the
// identical linear combination for every configuration. Empirically
// confirmed too, not just textually: tests/ac3/oba/test_dee_joc_fixture.cpp
// decodes a real Dolby-Encoding-Engine-produced stream using
// kDmxConfig5XPhaseShift through exactly this code path and every
// tone-identified object comes back correct.

//
// The returned audio LAGS `bed` by reconstruction_delay(domain) samples -
// 256 for kMdctBand, 576 for kQmf. Both are the algorithmic delay of the
// transform pair that domain runs, and neither can be shortened; a caller
// comparing the result against a known source has to shift by it, or it
// measures the delay instead of the reconstruction.
//
// `fast_mdct` and `fast_imdct` apply to Domain::kMdctBand only, and do
// nothing under kQmf, whose transform has only the one form. `fast_mdct`
// selects the §7.9.4 fold for the per-block forward analysis of the five
// bed channels; `fast_imdct` selects the same core for step 3 of each
// object's own §7.9.4.1 synthesis inverse - one per object per block, so 96
// of them in a 16-object frame, which is where nearly all of kMdctBand's
// time goes. Both default to the spec's own direct evaluations, the forms
// every fast-path test validates against; Eac3Decoder passes
// DecoderConfig::fast_mdct for the first and DecoderConfig::fast_imdct for
// the second.
