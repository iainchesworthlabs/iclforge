// How a player serves its layout: which of the decoder's own §7.8 folds it
// asks for, if any, and whether the decoder reconstructs the stream's objects
// for the renderer to place.
//
// A stereo or mono room is the decoder's fold (OutputLayout::fold); anything
// wider is rendered as coded (ac3/render/render.hpp). Objects are worth their
// cost only when the layout asks for what the bed cannot give. This is the
// ESP32 player's policy, moved out of the player so that every player that
// renders - the boards, the desktop player's engine and its test sink - makes
// the same decision from the same inputs (planning/hearth-reference-player.md,
// "Decoder configuration").

// kAuto reconstructs exactly when the layout has height speakers, which is
// the case the bed cannot serve; kAlways does so for any rendered layout;
// kNever plays the bed, the objects' own 5.1 fold, which is the complete mix
// for a stereo or 5.1 room. A layout that folds never reconstructs, whatever
// this says. On an ESP32-S3 reconstruction costs about 10 ms of every 32 ms
// frame and, under the QMF domain, about 233 KB of heap.
