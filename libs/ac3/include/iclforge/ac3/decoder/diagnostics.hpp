// A consumer-facing diagnostic sink: a callback hook for the recoverable,
// informational decode events a caller otherwise has no way to hear about -
// the CRC on this frame did not check out, or an EMDF container carried a
// payload id this decoder does not interpret and moved past. Neither of
// those stops the decode (see DecodeError for what does), so today they
// leave nothing behind: a CRC failure is only visible in the returned error
// (and, with DecoderConfig::concealment set, not even that - the same frame
// comes back as a SUCCESSFUL result), and a skipped EMDF payload id was never
// reported anywhere at all.
//
// A plain function pointer plus an opaque context, not std::function -
// matching DecoderConfig::trace/syntax's own pointer convention immediately
// above this field, this costs one null check and no allocation on a path
// that has to run from the minimum-footprint decoder profile
// (ICLFORGE_MINIMAL_DECODER: no exceptions, no RTTI) and from a real-time
// caller. Distinct from Tracy (ac3/internal/profiling.hpp): that answers
// "how fast", built only when ICLFORGE_ENABLE_TRACY is on and absent from
// the minimal profile entirely; this answers "what happened", always
// compiled in, and aimed at production rather than development.
