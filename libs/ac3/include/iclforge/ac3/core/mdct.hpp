// The AC-3 long (512-sample) transform pair.
//
// Forward (encoder side, informative A/52 §8.2.3.2, alpha = 0):
//   XD[k] = (-2/N) * sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] * cos((2pi/4N)(2n+1)(2k+1)
//                                              + (pi/4)(2k+1))
// evaluated in direct form by default — at THIS level the reference form
// stays the default, because the direct evaluation is the spec's own
// statement of the transform and the oracle every fast-path test validates
// against. `fast` selects the §7.9.4 fast N/4-FFT structure behind this same
// interface: verified max relative error ~3e-12 against the direct form on
// random data and real audio (libs/ac3/tests/core/test_mdct_fast.cpp), and since the owner
// accepted that evidence it is what every encoder config defaults to
// (EncoderConfig::fast_mdct / eac3::FrameConfig::fast_mdct default true and
// are what an encoder actually reads to decide - a caller of THIS function
// still opts in explicitly). All three forward transforms accelerate - this
// one and both halves of a block-switched pair, each down its own
// independently-derived fold; see mdct256_forward_first/second's own doc
// comment below.
//
// Inverse (decoder side, NORMATIVE §7.9.4.1): the N/4-point complex
// transform with xcos1/xsin1 pre/post twiddles and the windowing/
// de-interleaving map, transcribed exactly from the pseudocode. The forward
// transform is validated by round-tripping through this normative inverse
// plus the §7.9.4.1 step-6 overlap-add (pcm = 2 * (x + delay), the factor
// of 2 undoing encoder headroom scaling).
//
// The inverses' `fast` selects an FFT for step 3's N/4-point complex sum
// ONLY - the spec's own pseudocode evaluates that step as a direct O(N^2)
// sum against a tabulated (k, n) matrix, and with the +j*sin sign
// convention it is exactly an unscaled inverse DFT, so the fast path is
// conj(FFT(conj(Z))) through the same kernel the forward's fast fold
// already uses (iclforge/dsp/detail/fft_stockham.hpp). Steps 2, 4 and 5 - the normative twiddles
// and the windowing/de-interleave map - are the identical code either way.
// Direct remains the default at THIS level for the forward's own reason:
// the direct evaluation is the spec's statement of the transform and the
// oracle the fast path's tests validate against. DecoderConfig::fast_imdct
// is what a decoder actually reads to decide.
