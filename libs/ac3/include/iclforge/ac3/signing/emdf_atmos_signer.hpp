// EMDF Atmos object-signing - clean-room.
//
// Computes the keyed EMDF-protection primary tag over an iclforge Atmos
// syncframe and writes it into protection_bits_primary (recomputing crc2), so a
// decoder that validates the emdf_protection field will accept the frame's JOC
// object container instead of falling back to the 5.1 bed. See
// docs/concepts/object-signing.md.
//
// Provenance: the HMAC-SHA-256 construction (RFC 2104 / FIPS 180-4) and the
// choice of which frame regions are authenticated are derived from the public
// container layout this codec already emits (libs/objects/src/emdf.cpp,
// ETSI TS 103 420 / the E-AC-3 syntax) and reuse this project's own clean-room
// parsing primitives (BitReader, decode_exponents, compute_bit_allocation, the
// spx helpers). The ONLY externally-provisioned input is the key (SigningKey),
// which the operator supplies at runtime and this code never embeds - the same
// posture a licensed tool (DEE, via iLok) takes with its own key. A stream
// signed with a key that does not match a given decoder's simply fails that
// decoder's check, exactly as an unsigned one does; nothing here reconstructs a
// key.
//
// verify_atmos_frame/verify_atmos_stream below check a tag this same signer
// wrote - round-trip testing, tamper detection on this project's own signed
// test assets, and CI/delivery QC. That is NOT the same thing as, and grants
// no interoperability with, a real Dolby-licensed decoder's own proprietary
// auth gate: that one uses a completely different key and scheme baked into
// Dolby's binary, and this project has deliberately never attempted to forge
// or replicate it. See docs/concepts/object-signing.md.
