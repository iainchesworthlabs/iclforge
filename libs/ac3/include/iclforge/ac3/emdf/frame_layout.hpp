// Where things ARE in an E-AC-3 syncframe that carries an EMDF object
// container - a bit-accurate map of the frame, with no opinion about what to
// do with it.
//
// Two very different jobs need the same map, which is why it lives here
// rather than inside either of them:
//
//   - iclforge::ac3::signing (src/signing) authenticates a frame by hashing everything
//     EXCEPT the regions a licensed decoder is allowed to rewrite - the
//     framing words, the metadata flags, the skip fields and the CRC tail.
//     It needs those regions ("holes") and the container's own position.
//   - iclforge::ac3::io::strip_objects (ac3/io/object_strip.hpp) removes the object
//     layer without touching the audio. It needs the skip fields' exact bit
//     ranges, the frame-level skipflde flag, the addbsi object-audio marker,
//     and where the last mantissa ends.
//
// Walking a syncframe to bit accuracy means re-deriving every field width
// that depends on content - exponent strategies, spectral extension geometry,
// delta bit allocation, the bit allocation the mantissa widths come from -
// so having two copies of this walk would mean two copies of every one of
// those subtleties, drifting apart one bug fix at a time.
//
// SCOPE. The full map covers the shape iclforge's own Atmos encoder emits
// (see src/ac3/src/encoder/eac3_frame.cpp): one independent substream, 3/2
// with LFE, six blocks, frame-level exponent strategy and SNR, no coupling.
// That is exactly the shape both callers were written against. A frame
// outside it comes back with `supported` false rather than with a map
// derived from assumptions that do not hold - a bit offset wrong by one is
// not a smaller error here than a missing one, because both callers WRITE
// using these offsets.
//
// The object-layer SIGNALS are the exception, and are read for any E-AC-3
// syncframe whatever its shape: everything up to and including skipflde is
// reachable without a single content-dependent field width, so "does this
// frame carry an object layer at all?" always has an answer. That is what
// lets iclforge::ac3::io::strip_objects pass an ordinary stereo stream through
// untouched instead of refusing it for being out of scope. See
// FrameLayout::object_signals.
