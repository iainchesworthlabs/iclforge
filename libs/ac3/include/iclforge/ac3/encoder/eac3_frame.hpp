// E-AC-3 (Dolby Digital Plus) framing - ATSC A/52:2018 Annex E, bsid 16.
//
// E-AC-3 is not a variant of the AC-3 frame; it is a different container for
// the same coding tools:
//   - syncinfo is ONLY the sync word. There is no crc1, so the GF(2) leading
//     -CRC solver AC-3 needs has no counterpart here.
//   - frmsiz is an arbitrary 11-bit word count rather than a table lookup, so
//     any frame size is directly expressible and the 44.1 kHz padding
//     alternation AC-3 needs disappears.
//   - Exponent strategies and coupling-in-use for EVERY block are hoisted
//     into a frame-level audfrm element ahead of the blocks, and several
//     per-block fields become conditional on frame-level flags.
//
// This first step emits a valid, decodable bsid-16 frame carrying digital
// silence, the same way the AC-3 work started: all SNR offsets zero, which
// §7.2.2.1.1 defines as an all-zero bit allocation, so no mantissa data
// exists and the frame is pure syntax.

namespace iclforge::ac3::eac3 {

// kBsid, StreamType and the Table E2.5 chanmap live in
// ac3/core/eac3_tables.hpp: the decoder reads the same fields this writes, and
// one definition is what keeps the two agreeing on what a bit pattern means.
// This encoder writes only strmtyp 0x0 and 0x1 - 0x2, an independent substream
// whose program was previously coded as AC-3, drags in a blkid/frmsizecod
// branch nothing here would ever emit, so validate() refuses it.

// Average bit rate: a long-run rate target that still lets each frame's size
// move with the content. CBR holds every frame to the same size; VBR holds
// every frame to the same quality and lets the rate go where it likes;
// neither delivers what a streaming ladder rung or a DVB mux contracts for,
// which is a deliverable AVERAGE at a frame size still free to move.
//
// Set VbrConfig::abr and the encoder holds one composite SNR offset across
// frames and steers it - up while the stream is running under its target,
// down while it is running over - so a quiet frame stays cheap and a busy
// one is allowed to cost more, with the average landing where it was asked
// to. Underneath that, `window_frames` consecutive frames pool one budget as
// a hard ceiling, so no window can overrun whatever the offset is doing.
//
// VbrConfig::quality is NOT read under ABR. The two are different rate
// controls: quality fixes the offset, ABR's whole job is to move it, and the
// stream's first frame seeds the offset from its own budget search rather
// than from a number a caller guessed. VbrConfig::min_kbps/max_kbps do still
// apply - they bound each individual frame, which composes with a long-run
// average rather than competing with it.
