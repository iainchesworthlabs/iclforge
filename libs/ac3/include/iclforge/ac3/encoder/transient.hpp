// Transient detection (A/52 §8.2.2): the basic-encoder recipe that decides
// blksw[ch], the one-bit-per-channel-per-block flag driving block switching.
// Shared by both encoders - the recipe is generation-agnostic, and neither
// this project's exponent/bit-allocation/mantissa layers nor the decoder need
// to know how blksw was chosen, only what it says.

namespace iclforge::ac3 {

// One instance per full-bandwidth channel of a continuous encode: both the
// cascaded biquad's filter memory and the hierarchical peak tree's P[j][0]
// carry (§8.2.2 step 3's own note - "P[j][0]... is defined to be the peak of
// the last segment on level j of the tree calculated immediately prior to
// the current tree") persist from one 256-sample segment to the next, so
// state belongs to the channel's stream, not to a single call.
//
// A template on the scalar the filter runs in (float32 for the minimum-footprint profile).
// TransientDetector below - the double instantiation - is what every
// ordinary build and both encoders' double forms use, and its arithmetic is
// exactly what the non-template class's was. The float instantiation is for
// the minimum-footprint profile (ac3/internal/encode_scalar.hpp), whose
// targets have single-precision hardware at best: on an ESP32-S3 this
// detector in double was 57 ms of a 201 ms AC-3 5.1 frame, every biquad tap
// a call into the ROM's software floating point (docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md).
// The recipe is the same in both; only the rounding differs, and with it,
// now and then, a decision that sits on a threshold.
