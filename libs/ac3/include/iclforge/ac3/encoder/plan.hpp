//
// This exists because there are two front ends. Every name here was previously
// spelled out inside forge: the layout table, the Annex E tool token, the
// widening of AC-3's coarse downmix levels into E-AC-3's finer ones. A GUI that
// re-derived any of them would be free to disagree with the command line about
// what "5.1.4" means or which tools "all" turns on, and nothing would catch it.
// So the layouts, the tokens and the config construction live here, and the
// front ends only collect and display.
//
// Nothing in this file encodes anything. It builds EncoderConfig and
// AccessUnitConfig values and says how a source's channels reach them; the
// encoders are unchanged and unaware of it.
