// Where the coded spectrum should stop.
//
// Both encoders used to answer this from the bit rate alone - AC-3 from a
// per-channel-kbps curve, E-AC-3 not at all (a fixed chbwcod 60, the whole
// 23.7 kHz, even at 96 kbit/s per channel). The bit rate says how many bits
// there are to spend; it says nothing about whether there is anything up
// there to spend them on, and the two questions have different answers on
// different programme material at the same rate.
//
// The trap this has to avoid is documented in encoder.cpp: narrowing the
// band improves every waveform metric this project measures, on real
// programme material as much as on the checked-in fixtures, because the
// energy discarded is a vanishing fraction of the total whatever the source
// (measured: 3.5e-8 of a solo piano recording's energy sits above 14.7 kHz,
// against 7e-5 of reference_51.wav's). An SNR-led rule therefore narrows
// until it is plainly audible and still reports a win. So the criterion here
// is not "is this band small" - it always is - but "is this band audible",
// which is a question A/52's own psychoacoustic model already answers.

// `peak_exponents` is one exponent per bin from bin 0 - the per-bin MINIMUM
// over every full-bandwidth channel and every block of the frame, a minimum
// exponent being a maximum magnitude. That makes this the frame's loudest
// spectrum rather than an average: a band is kept if ANY channel in ANY block
// has something audible in it, which is the only safe direction when one
// decision covers all six blocks and every coupled channel.
//
// The test is §7.2.2.2's psd curve, banded by §7.2.2.3, against Table 7.15's
// absolute hearing threshold - the same `hth` compute_bit_allocation() floors
// its own masking curve with. A band below it is a band whose mask is the
// threshold itself, so the allocator would have to be handed a positive SNR
// offset before it put a single bit there; dropping it costs nothing coded
// and returns its exponents. Above 17 kHz Table 7.15 rises 34 dB in one band
// step, which is why this keeps roughly 17 kHz on ordinary material and more
// only when the material is genuinely bright up there.
//
// Returns at least `endmant_for_chbwcod(0)` (73 bins, 6.9 kHz): the floor
// exists because a frame of near-silence has nothing above the threshold
// anywhere, and a bandwidth that collapses on quiet passages and reopens on
// loud ones would be audible as pumping rather than as detail.

// rule over the whole corpus - real programme material (piano, thunderstorm,
// church bells, speech, samba) and both checked-in fixtures - at each
// per-channel rate the AC-3 legs reach:
//
//   per channel     64      89      96     128     192     224

//
// The 128 column is where it turns, and it turns on the material that has
// the least harmonic structure to mask a missing band. Split out, that
// column is +0.004 MOS over the six stereo legs and -0.355 on
// reference_51.wav at 640 kbit/s, whose FIR-smoothed noise is flat to
// Nyquist. The real thunderstorm leg makes the same point without the
// fixture: +0.004 MOS at 128 kbit/s per channel, -0.017 at 192, -0.050 at
// 224. 128 is the last rate at which noise-like content still gains.
//
// What this costs is the 128-per-channel column's stereo wins - E-AC-3
// stereo at 256 kbit/s measured +1.0 to +3.5 dB SNR and up to +0.015 MOS -
// given up to keep the rule from ever losing. Separating those cases wants
