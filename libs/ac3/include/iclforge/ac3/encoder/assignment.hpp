// Multi-source input: an explicit alternative to route()'s automatic,
// direction-based panning. route() places ONE source onto a target by where
// its channels sit in the room; a caller with several sources - several
// files, several capture devices, or dual mono's two independent programmes
// - instead says exactly where each of THEIR channels goes, channel by
// channel. Assignment is that statement, and the route() overload below
// turns it into the same Routing render() already knows how to apply.
//
// This lives beside plan.hpp rather than in it because it is a distinct
// concern - plan.hpp says what to encode, this says how a source's channels
// reach it - and because most callers (a single WAV onto a named layout)
// never need it: they stay on the automatic route().
