// The whole point of this file: prove the AVX2 build/link/dispatch/test
// pipeline end to end with something that carries no bit-exactness stakes
// at all, before any real kernel is built on top of it (SIMD kernels's
// dynamic-dispatch follow-on).
//
// avx2_probe.cpp is compiled with an AVX2 target flag (/arch:AVX2 or
// -mavx2 - see libs/ac3/CMakeLists.txt's forge_simd_avx2 object library
// and tests/CMakeLists.txt's matching per-source flag on the SAME file
// compiled a second time directly into the test binary) TWICE: once into
// the library proper, once into iclforge-tests, so the AVX2 codegen path is
// exercised - proven to compile, link and execute correctly - on both,
// independent of whether ICLFORGE's own consumer (iclforge-tests) links the
// static or the shared library (see the config-linux-llvm-shared CI leg).
// Only the compiled-in TEST copy needs to be directly callable without
// crossing a possible DLL export boundary, which is exactly why it is
// compiled a second time rather than linked against the library's own
// forge_simd_avx2 object - the same white-box arrangement
// tests/CMakeLists.txt already gives src/signing/src.
//
// Internal to libs/ac3/ on purpose - never installed, never part of the
// public ac3/ API, exactly like ac3/internal/profiling.hpp beside it.
