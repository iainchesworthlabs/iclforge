    // zero-bap bins are the whole input and payload.bap only holds the
    // winning offset's allocation from the evaluation just above; the flags
    // cost nothing in bits (dithflage is on regardless), so nothing about the
    // frame's size depends on this.
    //
    // Two streams are left out of the weighing, both because the decoder does
    // not dither them:
    //   * an AHT stream, whose zero-hebap bins reconstruct as literal zero
    //     whatever dithflag says (§E3.4's mantissas are read once for the
    //     whole frame, and there is no per-block substitution step);
    //   * every stream at all, when spectral extension is in use - see below.
    //
    // Spectral extension is the one place this encoder holds a reconstruction
    // of what the decoder will produce (the `rebuild` lambda in step 10),
    // because the extension bands are scaled to match the copy source's own
    // energy. Dither would change that source, and the encoder cannot
    // reproduce the values: DitherGenerator is deterministic per decoder
    // instance, but the sequence a given bin receives depends on how many
    // zero-bap bins the decoder walked before it, across every stream and
    // block. Mirroring that would mean duplicating the decoder's traversal
    // order in the encoder, which is exactly the kind of shadow model this
