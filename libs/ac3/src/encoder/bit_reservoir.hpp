// The sliding-window bit reservoir behind E-AC-3's average-rate (ABR) mode.
//
// VBR fixes quality and lets each frame cost whatever the content asks for;
// CBR fixes the frame size and lets quality follow. Neither delivers what a
// streaming ladder rung or a DVB mux actually contracts for, which is an
// AVERAGE rate over time with the per-frame size still free to move. This is
// the accounting that makes that deliverable: a window of consecutive frames
// shares one pooled budget, so a cheap frame's leftover words are still there
// for the frame after it, and a frame that overspends is paid for by the
// frames it slides past.
//
// Deliberately just the accounting - it hands out a word allowance and takes
// back what was actually spent. What the encoder does with that allowance is
// AbrController's job below, and it is deliberately NOT "search for the
// offset that fills it" - see that class for why.
//
// Internal to src/ac3/src/encoder/ for the same reason snr_search.hpp is:
// plumbing between the encoder's own translation units, not library surface.

// reservoir" design reduces to - spends the whole budget every frame by
// construction, so the frame size stops following the content and ABR
// becomes CBR with extra steps. That was measured, not assumed: with the
// offset capped at a fixed quality the reservoir banked words it could never
// spend, and scored 1.75 dB BELOW plain CBR at the same average rate on
// material with real dynamics.
//
// So the offset is HELD across frames and nudged instead. At a fixed offset
// a quiet frame is genuinely cheaper than a loud one - that is the whole of
// VBR - and an integral controller moves the offset until the average of
// those varying costs is the rate that was asked for. The window's allowance
// stays on as a hard ceiling underneath, so no window can overrun its budget
// however the controller is behaving.
