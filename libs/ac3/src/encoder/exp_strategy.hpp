// Exponent-run planning, shared by both encoders' §8.2.8 reuse-span decisions
// (AC-3's encoder.cpp and E-AC-3's eac3_frame.cpp).
//
// The strategy a chosen span earns under Table E2.10 is a spec rule and lives
// with the rest of the exponent pipeline (iclforge::ac3::strategy_for_span,
// core/exponents.hpp). What follows is the other half of the plan - WHERE the
// spans end - and that is a judgement about cost rather than anything the
// standard states, which is why it sits here in the encoder's own headers.
//
// Internal to src/ac3/src/encoder/ on purpose, the same way snr_search.hpp
// is: plumbing between the two encoder translation units, not library surface.
// tests/ac3/encoder/test_exp_strategy.cpp includes it directly.

namespace iclforge::ac3::internal {

// §8.2.8: "when the variation exceeds a threshold, new exponents will be
// sent".
//
// The threshold is a judgement about COST, so it is not one number. A full-
// bandwidth channel's set is 4 + 7*ngrps bits - about 590 at D15 over a
// 250-coefficient band - and spending that mid-frame has to buy back more
// than it costs, so it waits for the exponents to have really moved: a mean
// change above two steps, 12 dB per bin.
//
// The LFE's set is always two groups, 18 bits, thirty times cheaper. Holding
// it to the same bar means almost never refreshing it, and the frame's one
// set is then the per-bin minimum across six blocks - a scale chosen by the
// loudest of them. Any block quieter than that is quantized against the wrong
// scale for the sake of not spending 18 bits. So the LFE refreshes as soon as
// its exponents move at all, which is the trade its own cost argues for.
//
// This is the AC-3 encoder's rule, kept because that is the encoder it was
// measured on. plan_exponent_runs below replaces it for E-AC-3 with an
// explicit accounting of the same trade - see its own comment for why a fixed
// threshold turned out not to travel.

// The best plan for one stream, by exhaustive dynamic programming over every
// partition of its blocks and (where the frame form allows it) every strategy
// for every run.
//
// Both halves of the trade are counted in bits, which is what makes them
// comparable at all:
//
//   cost   - the exponent set itself, 4 + 7 * ngrps.
//   waste  - the mantissa precision the set gives up. One exponent step is a
//            factor of two of scale, so a bin quantized against a set one step
//            coarser than its own block wanted carries about 6 dB more
//            quantization noise - one bit of accuracy.
//
// The waste is bounded, per bin, by what that bin was actually given
// (`precision`). Without that bound the model is badly wrong in the direction
// that matters: a quiet block's bin sits 18 exponent steps below the loud
// block that set the run's scale, and counting all 18 as recoverable would
// value a refresh at thousands of bits when the bin is allocated three. It
// cannot lose precision it never had - a bin with no bits at all loses
// nothing, and reconstructs to zero either way.
//
// That bound is the whole reason this is not a fixed threshold. At 192 kbit/s
// stereo a frame has roughly 1.5 mantissa bits per bin-block to spend, so most
// bins are allocated nothing; a rule that counts every bin's headroom as a
// saving will happily spend a tenth of the frame on exponent sets that buy
// silence. The AC-3 encoder's fixed "mean two steps" threshold is right for
// AC-3, which is where it was measured - this is not a claim that it is wrong
// there, only that it does not travel to a different rate regime by itself.
//
// Annex E has two frame forms, and the encoder wants the best plan under
// each: hoisted (expstre == 0, every run's strategy fixed by Table E2.10 from
// its span) and per-block (every strategy free). Both are the same dynamic
// programme over the same candidate runs, differing only in which strategies
// a run may take, so plan_exponent_runs_both scores both in one pass: each
// candidate's exponent set and its waste are computed once and offered to
// whichever form admits it. What each form is offered, and in what order, is
// exactly what its own pass would have seen, so the plans are the plans the
// separate passes found - the tie-breaking is the same strict comparison in
// the same sequence.
//
// Four things keep the pass short without changing its answer. A candidate's
// waste is never negative, so a run whose exponent set alone already costs
// as much as the best plan found for its end block cannot improve on it:
// the set's cost is the lower bound, and a candidate below it is skipped
// before its set is built. A bin allocated no precision loses none, so only
// the coded bins are summed - at low rates a minority of them. A run's
// banded set depends only on its per-bin minimum, so while extending the run
// by a block moves no minimum the set stands, and the extended run's waste is
// the waste so far plus the new block's row. And that row is summed along
// the block's own exponents rather than bin by bin down a column, which is
// the order they are laid out in.
//
// Complexity was blocks^2 * strategies passes over the bins per form - about
// 32k operations for a 253-bin channel, twice per stream per frame.
