    // material at one rate is not enough to move a default that touches every
    // AC-3 stream - fgaincod below took five rates on two materials plus a

    // each fbw channel's chfsnroffst and the coupling channel's cplfsnroffst,
    // and this encoder was writing the shared fine offset into it - the same
    // value every fbw channel gets. That is legal, and it is what FFmpeg does too (its
    // lfefsnroffst matches its chfsnroffst in every block of its own 448 kbit/s
    // 5.1 stream), but it leaves the LFE a price-taker in a search it cannot
    // influence: step 9 picks the one composite offset at which the frame's
    // TOTAL mantissa cost fits, and that total is set by channels of ~250 bins
    // each. The LFE's 7 bins (kLfeEndmant) are rounding error in that
    // sum, so the offset that governs the LFE's precision is decided entirely
    // by channels 36 times its size - and when the frame tightens, the LFE
    // loses precision at the same rate as they do despite costing a fraction as
    // much to serve.
    //
    // Raising only its own field corrects that asymmetry, and it is cheap for
    // the same reason it was mispriced: at 448 kbit/s 5.1 the LFE holds 2.5% of
    // the frame's mantissa bits, so +4 fine steps moves about 12 bits per frame
    // out of 14336 and leaves the frame's total mantissa cost unchanged to
    // within a bit.
    //
    // +4 measured on two materials (the committed fixture and quality_race's
    // synthesized full-band decorrelated 5.1) at 192/256/320/384/448/640:
    // LFE +0.04 to +5.70 dB, overall SNR up at every one of the twelve points
    // (worst +0.00), ViSQOL MOS flat (worst -0.005, best +0.004). At 448 on the
    // fixture the LFE goes from 5.20 dB behind FFmpeg 8.0.1 to 1.77 behind.
    // The response plateaus by about +6 fine steps and the 4-bit field clamps
    // it regardless, so this cannot run away on unusual material.
    //
    // Independent of, and complementary to, the LFE exponent-refresh fix: with
    // both, the LFE at 448 reaches 0.71 dB AHEAD of FFmpeg. That one stops the
    // LFE being quantized against a scale meant for a louder block; this one
    // stops it being allocated by a search that cannot see it.
    //
    // The LFE's other private field, lfefgaincod, was measured as
    // the alternative and rejected: raising it to 6 or 7 is worth far more SNR
    // (LFE +11 to +18 dB at 448) but it pushes the LFE to 55-72 dB, well past
