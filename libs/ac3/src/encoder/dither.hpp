// §7.3.4's dithflag[ch], decided from content.
//
// A bin the allocator gave no bits to is not transmitted at all, so the
// decoder has to invent it. dithflag says WHICH invention: clear means a true
// zero, set means a random value uniform on ±0.707 of that bin's own exponent
// scale (DitherGenerator, ac3/core/mantissas.hpp). Neither is the coefficient
// the encoder had, and the two fail in opposite directions - a run of true
// zeros is a hole in the spectrum, audible as the "birdies"/warbling the tool
// exists to cover, while dither over a bin that really was near-silent is
// noise added to nothing.
//
// So the decision is a comparison, per channel per block, between the energy
// the decoder will NOT receive and the energy the dither would put there
// instead:
//
//   signal = sum over zero-bap bins of the real coefficient's energy
//   noise  = sum over the same bins of the dither's own variance,
//            0.1666 * 2^(-2*exponent) per bin
//
// Dither goes on when signal >= noise. Read plainly: substitute noise only
// where what is being replaced was at least as loud as the substitute. Above
// that line the bins hold real content the allocator could not afford and
// filling them is what §7.3.4 is for; below it - and digital silence is the
// limiting case, where `signal` is exactly zero - dither would be the loudest
// thing in the band.
//
// The threshold is a ratio, which is what makes it usable on a coupled
// channel: the decoder dithers a zero-bap COUPLING bin once per receiving
// channel and then scales it by that channel's coupling coordinate, and the
// real coefficient behind it is scaled by the same coordinate, so the two
// sides of the comparison move together and the coordinate cancels.
//
// Two reference encoders were read out of tests/golden/external-baseline/ to
// check this against something other than a metric (both AC-3 5.1 at
// 448 kbit/s, 79 frames each). FFmpeg 8.0.1 sets every dithflag in every
// frame. Dolby's own DEE 6.5.4 sets dithflag to exactly the inverse of that
// channel's blksw - 392 blocks of (blksw 0, dither on) and 3 of (blksw 1,
// dither off), no exception either way. So real encoders dither by default
// and switch it off on a transient; the block-switch half of that rule is
// applied at both call sites, and the comparison above is what decides the
// rest.
//
// Internal to libs/ac3/src/encoder/ on purpose, like snr_search.hpp beside
// it - shared between the AC-3 and E-AC-3 encoders, not library surface.
