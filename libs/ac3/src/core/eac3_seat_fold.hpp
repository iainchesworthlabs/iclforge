// Where a rendered Table E2.5 location seats once a programme with no §7.8
// fold of its own - a wide layout such as 7.1.4 or 5.1.2 - has to be reduced
// to the nearest acmod before §7.8 can fold it at all.
//
// This IS an extension beyond §7.8, and worth being plain about: §7.8 defines
// folds FROM the eight AC-3 acmods and says nothing about the wide layouts
// Annex E's chanmap can express - a 7.1.4 program has no §7.8 fold, because
// §7.8 predates anything that could code one. Reducing first is the least
// invented thing available: every extra location has an obvious §7.8 seat (a
// wide left is a left, a rear surround is a surround, a top front left is a
// left), and once it is in that seat the actual downmix is the spec's own,
// with the stream's own levels. The alternative - dropping the channels §7.8
// cannot name - would silently discard the whole height layer.
//
// -3 dB on every secondary contribution, so two locations sharing one seat
// sum to the power of one. A location already IN the reduced layout arrives
// at unity, which makes the reduction an exact identity for every plain
// acmod bed - the overwhelmingly common case, and the one that must not
// change by so much as a bit.
//
// Shared between iclforge::ac3::OutputStage's rendered-layout fold (decoder/output.cpp,
// a decoder rendering a wide programme for a listener) and
// iclforge::ac3::eac3::AccessUnitEncoder's whole-programme §7.7.2 peak measurement
// (encoder/eac3_frame.cpp, an encoder deciding what ceiling to promise for
// one) - one definition of which seat a location falls into is what keeps an
// encoder's promise and a decoder's protection describing the same fold.
