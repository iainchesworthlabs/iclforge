// The REFERENCE (direct-form) halves of §8.2.3.2's forward MDCT and §7.9.4.2
// step 3's inverse inner sums, behind a declaration so their tables can be
// left out of a build entirely (minimum-footprint decoder profile).
//
// Why this exists as a seam at all: each of the five entry points below is
// backed by a full (k, n) cosine/sine matrix, lazily constructed but
// STATICALLY allocated - the storage is reserved by the linker whether or not
// the function is ever called. Measured on the object file
// (dumpbin /HEADERS over mdct.cpp.obj):
//
//     ForwardCosTable<512>      1,048,576 B   forward, long
//     ForwardCosTable<256> x 2    524,288 B   forward, the two short halves
//     InnerSumTable               262,144 B   inverse, long
//     InnerSumPairTable            65,536 B   inverse, short
//                                ----------
//                                1,900,544 B  (1.81 MiB) of .bss
//
// - against about 12 KiB for every table the FAST paths need. A set-top box
// or DSP port paying 1.81 MiB of RAM for the arithmetic it is not running is
// the whole of what the minimum-footprint profile's table ROM budget is about.
//
// So the definitions live in ONE of two CMake-selected translation units -
// src/core/transform/{reference,stub}/reference_transform.cpp - exactly as
// ac3/internal/profiling.hpp and src/audio's platform backends are selected,
// and for the same reason (tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1: no
// #ifdef). iclforge::ac3::internal::kReferenceTransformAvailable
// (ac3/internal/profile.hpp, selected the same way) says which one is in the
// build, and the public API refuses a configuration that would need the
// missing one rather than silently substituting the fast path - see
// DecoderConfig::fast_imdct and EncoderConfig::fast_mdct.
//
// The stub variant's bodies are unreachable by construction, not merely
// unused: every caller checks kReferenceTransformAvailable first.

// changes where the code lives, not what it computes.
