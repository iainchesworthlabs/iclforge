// compute_bit_allocation, with its internal §7.2.2.5 masking curve exposed to
// the caller - the one quantity that routine derives and then discards, and
// the piece the research trace export needs that exponents/bap
// alone do not carry. Internal to src/ac3/src/ (decoder.cpp and
// eac3_decoder.cpp are its only two callers, feeding
// verify::StreamTrace::mask/Eac3StreamTrace::mask), matching the convention
// src/decoder/gain.hpp and src/encoder/snr_search.hpp already use for
// cross-translation-unit plumbing that is not library surface.
//
// A second entry point rather than a parameter added to the public, exported
// iclforge::ac3::compute_bit_allocation: that function's signature is part of this
// library's ABI, and growing it would change every consumer's link
// requirement for a facility only the trace has any use for. See
// CONTRIBUTING.md's ABI-gate note and tools/ci/abi-allowlist/.
