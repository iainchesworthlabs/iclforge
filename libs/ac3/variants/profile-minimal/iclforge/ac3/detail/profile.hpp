// Build-profile facts, in the MINIMUM-FOOTPRINT DECODER variant
// (ICLFORGE_MINIMAL_DECODER, minimum-footprint decoder profile). Every ordinary build compiles the
// identically-pathed header under src/internal/profile/full/ instead;
// src/ac3/CMakeLists.txt picks the directory, so no source file here asks
// which profile it is in with a preprocessor conditional
// (tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1's rule, the same mechanism
// ac3/internal/profiling.hpp and src/audio's platform backends use).
//
// Internal, never installed: these are facts about how this library was
// built, not part of its API. A caller that needs to know whether the
// reference transform is present finds out the way any caller does - by
// asking for it and being refused (DecodeError::kNoReferenceTransform).

namespace iclforge::ac3::internal {

// ICLFORGE_MINIMAL_DECODER. True here: this build is decode-only, has no
// direct-form transform tables, and is compiled without exceptions or RTTI.

// now, on its own CMake-selected seam: which profile this is and which
// scalar the decoder carries are independent questions, and welding them
// together meant the float32 path could only exist in a build with no CLI
// to measure it against. See that header.
