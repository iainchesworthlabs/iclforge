// Build-profile facts, in the variant every ORDINARY build compiles
// (the full profile). The minimum-footprint decoder profile compiles the
// identically-pathed header under src/internal/profile/minimal/ instead;
// libs/ac3/CMakeLists.txt picks the directory, so no source file here asks
// which profile it is in with a preprocessor conditional
// (tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1's rule, the same mechanism
// ac3/internal/profiling.hpp and libs/audio's platform backends use).
//
// Internal, never installed: these are facts about how this library was
// built, not part of its API. A caller that needs to know whether the
// reference transform is present finds out the way any caller does - by
// asking for it and being refused (DecodeError::kNoReferenceTransform).

// to measure it against. See that header.
