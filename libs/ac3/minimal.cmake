# iclforge::ac3_minimal - the whole of libs/ac3 under the minimum-footprint
# profile (ICLFORGE_MINIMAL_DECODER, or ICLFORGE_MINIMAL_ENCODER for the
# encode-only archive). Included and returned from by CMakeLists.txt in this
# directory, so the ordinary static+shared build below it cannot be perturbed
# by this profile at all:
# there is exactly one `if` between the two shapes, at the top of that file,
# and everything specific to this one lives here.
#
# The differences from the ordinary build, and why each is here rather than
# expressed as options on the normal targets:
#
#   - STATIC only. A shared library needs a dynamic loader; this profile's
#     targets are bare metal (see cmake/toolchains/arm-none-eabi.toolchain.cmake).
#     Declaring iclforge_ac3_shared at all fails outright for arm-none-eabi.
#
#   - Decode-only sources. See the list below for what each one is for; the
#     encoder, the WAV/container I/O, the analysis and QC layers and the
#     object ENCODER are all absent, and the sources that remain are exactly
#     what a decode reaches. This is checked, not asserted: the archive is
#     linked into firmware/baremetal's probe with --gc-sections and any missing
#     symbol is a link error.
#
#   - src/core/transform/stub/ instead of src/core/transform/reference/, and
#     src/internal/profile/minimal/ instead of .../full/ - the two
#     CMake-selected variants that carry the profile's one behavioural
#     difference. See src/core/reference_transform.hpp.
#
#   - cmake/MinimalDecoder.cmake's iclforge::minimal_profile compile options, and
#     PUBLIC rather than PRIVATE: -fno-exceptions is not a private
#     implementation detail of an archive, it is a property a consumer has to
#     share or the two disagree about whether a call can throw.
