// The spatial/object layer: applications place and move mono sources around
// the listener; the renderer turns the scene into a 5.1 channel bed that
// feeds the AC-3 encoder (or any other sink — nothing here knows about
// AC-3 except the bed's channel order).
//
// Design:
// - 2D pairwise amplitude panning (VBAP on the horizontal ring — 5.1 has no
//   height): pick the adjacent speaker pair around the target azimuth, solve
//   the 2x2 system, clamp, and normalize to Σg² = 1 (energy preservation).
// - Speaker geometry per ITU-R BS.775: C 0°, L +30°, R −30°, SL +110°,
//   SR −110° (azimuth counterclockwise from front, degrees).
// - Objects never feed the LFE implicitly; an explicit lfe_send exists.
// - Automation is clocked at the 256-sample block: targets set between
//   blocks, applied with per-sample linear ramps (no zipper noise).
// - The render path performs no allocation.
