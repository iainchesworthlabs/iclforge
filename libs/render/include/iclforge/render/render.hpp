// From what the decoder rendered to what the speakers want, one 256-sample
// block at a time.
//
// The decoder hands over a PcmBlock: the coded channels of the programme in
// Table E2.5 order and, when the stream carries an object layer and the
// decoder reconstructed it, the objects beside them with the metadata that
// places them. This turns that into one block per output slot of an
// OutputLayout, two ways:
//
//   THE BED, when there are no objects to place (an AC-3 or plain E-AC-3
//   stream, or a player that chose not to reconstruct). Every coded channel is
//   a source at its Table E2.5 direction, panned onto the layout's speakers by
//   iclforge::spatial::pan_direction - which for a channel whose location the layout
//   has is unit gain to that one slot, exactly, and for one it lacks (a 7.1
//   stream's rear surrounds on a 5.1 room) is the pairwise spread the panner
//   gives. The LFE goes to the LFE slots and nowhere else.
//
//   THE OBJECTS, when a unit carries them and the player asked for them. Each
//   object's own reconstructed audio is summed into the speakers by its OAMD
//   position, at its own gain - the render firmware/baremetal/probe.cpp's
//   eac3_atmos_render row performs and forge's `qc objects=` meters, in the
//   same arithmetic and the same order, so a level measured here agrees with
//   the probe's reference to the digit. The bed's other channels are NOT added
//   on top: for a JOC programme the bed IS the objects' 5.1 fold, and adding it
//   would render everything twice. The bed's LFE passes through, because it is
//   not an object - and it passes through late. A reconstructed object comes
//   out oba::joc::reconstruction_delay() samples after the bed it was pulled
//   from (docs/library/decoding.md, "Atmos objects lag the bed"): 576 in the
//   QMF domain a decoder reconstructs in by default, 256 in the MDCT-band one
//   (set_joc_domain). Played as it arrives, the LFE would reach the room that
//   far ahead of the objects it goes with, so it goes through a delay line of
//   that length first. The bass a small speaker hands to the LFE feed (below)
//   is the objects' own and already late, so it is not held back again.
//   libs/render/tests/test_object_lfe_timing.cpp measures both, end to end.
//
// The gains are trigonometry in double, refreshed when the coded layout
// changes (set_bed) and once per unit for the objects (set_objects, on the
// unit's first block); the per-sample work is float multiply-adds on the FPU,
// which is where an ESP32-S3 spends its time well. render() never allocates.
// Outside it, nothing here does but describe_objects' own vector of
// descriptions, once per unit, and the LFE's delay line, once, when
// set_objects() first has an object to place - 2,304 bytes for a 5.1 bed in
// the QMF domain, 1,024 in the MDCT-band one, and nothing for a renderer that
// only ever plays the bed. The line is a vector rather than an array in the
// object because this object is copied by value onto small FreeRTOS stacks
// (the ESP32 player constructs one there), the case OutputLayout::kTextBytes'
// comment records a boot loop from.
//
// Moved from the ESP-IDF component with layout.hpp, and tested on the host in
// libs/render/tests/test_layout.cpp: the geometry has its own tests under
// libs/render/tests/, so what is checked here is the indexing between coded
// channels, objects and slots - the part where a swapped subscript is silent.
//
// Bass management. A slot marked ":small" (OutputLayout::listed()) cannot
// reproduce the bottom two octaves, so its bass is redirected to the LFE
// feed rather than sent there - the same thing every AVR's speaker-size
// setting does. A matched high-pass/low-pass pair per small slot, same
// corner frequency and Q (Butterworth, 1/sqrt(2)) on both sides, since a
// mismatched pair would leave a dip or a peak in the room's response around
// the crossover. Only ever reached through render(): fold() never returns a
// target for a layout with an LFE feed, and a small speaker is rejected
// unless the layout has one, so a layout with any small speaker can never
// reach render_folded() - nothing to branch on there. The filters are
// FloatBiquad (ac3/render/float_biquad.hpp), which says why they are float
// rather than iclforge::dsp::Biquad. The corner is a setting (set_crossover_hz),
// in the range an AVR's speaker setup offers.
