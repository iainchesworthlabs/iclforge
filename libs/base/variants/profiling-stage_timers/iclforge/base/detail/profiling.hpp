// Zone macros, stage-timer variant - the third answer to
// "ac3/internal/profiling.hpp", beside tracy_enabled/ and tracy_disabled/,
// and selected the same way: CMake puts this directory on the include path
// (libs/ac3/minimal.cmake, under ICLFORGE_STAGE_TIMERS) rather than any
// source asking with an #ifdef.
//
// What it is for. Tracy needs a host with a socket and a build with the
// Tracy client in it; a minimum-footprint decoder on a bare-metal part has
// neither, and the question that profile eventually has to answer - "where
// do the microseconds of one frame go on this silicon?" - cannot be answered
// from the emulator (docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md's Timing section). So the same
// ICLFORGE_ZONE_SCOPED_N() markers the Tracy build uses are routed here to two
// plain functions the APPLICATION supplies: one at zone entry, one at exit.
// The library carries no clock, no table and no output of its own, because a
// clock is exactly the thing that differs per platform (esp_timer on
// ESP-IDF, semihosting under QEMU, std::chrono on a host) and the probe
// already owns that seam as iclforge_probe::now_us().
//
// apps/baremetal/stage_timers.cpp is the one implementation today: a stack
// of open zones and a per-name accumulator, reported per fixture as
// `<codec>.stage[<name>]` lines beside the decode timing the probe already
// prints. Any other application linking a library built with this variant
// must define the same two functions or fail to link - which is the intended
// failure, loud and at link time, rather than a zone quietly timing nothing.
//
// Cost when selected: two calls and two clock reads per zone, which the
// probe measures on itself and reports as stage.pair_cost_ns so a reader can
// subtract them. Cost when not selected: none, since tracy_disabled/ is then
// the directory on the path and every macro below expands to nothing there.
