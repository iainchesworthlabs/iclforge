// clang-cl deliberately does NOT use this file even though it is Clang

// linked in, which is a given on a normal Clang toolchain but not
// guaranteed under clang-cl's usual MSVC-CRT-linked configuration this
// project uses - see the msvc/ sibling directory, which clang-cl shares
// with real MSVC for exactly that reason.
