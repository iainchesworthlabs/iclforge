// Zone macros for Tracy instrumentation, real-Tracy variant - selected by
// CMake (libs/ac3/CMakeLists.txt adds this directory, not the tracy_disabled
// sibling, to forge_objects's private include path when ICLFORGE_ENABLE_TRACY
// is on - see cmake/Tracy.cmake) rather than an #ifdef, per the project's
// platform/feature-isolation rule (tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1):
// exactly one of this file and tracy_disabled/ac3/internal/profiling.hpp is
// ever compiled, both at this same "ac3/internal/profiling.hpp" relative
// path, so every call site's #include "ac3/internal/profiling.hpp" and every
// ICLFORGE_ZONE_SCOPED()/ICLFORGE_ZONE_SCOPED_N() use compiles unchanged either way.
//
// Internal, not installed: this is a build-diagnostics tool, not part of the
// library's public interface - hence living under src/, not include/.

// A second, independent frame view alongside the default one - for a
// real-time cadence that is not "the" main loop (e.g. Qt Quick's render
// frames in an app whose own primary loop, like Crucible's audio frame,
// already marks the default/unnamed set - two unrelated cadences on one
// frame set would interleave into a single meaningless graph).
