// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The portable (no-SIMD) member of the arch seam.
//
// One of src/base/variants/{arch-generic,arch-x86_64,arch-aarch64}/ is put on
// the include path by src/base/CMakeLists.txt (iclforge::base_headers's INTERFACE), so every
// `#include "ac3/internal/arch/simd.hpp"` in the codec core resolves to
// exactly one of these three identically-pathed headers - the mechanism
// src/internal/profiling/tracy_{enabled,disabled}/ already uses for the
// profiling seam, and src/audio's backend tree uses for the operating
// system. No translation unit ever asks which architecture it is being
// compiled for, which is what tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1
// enforces (no preprocessor conditional anywhere in the first-party trees).
//
// WHAT THE SEAM IS. Two vector types, both 128 bits wide - two doubles or
// four 32-bit integers. 128 bits is not a compromise width picked to keep
// the code simple: it is the native width of every platform this work names
// as the reason to do it at all (NEON on the Raspberry Pi and the Shield's
// Tegra X1, WASM's simd128), and it is the only x86-64 width that needs no
// -march= flag and therefore no runtime dispatch. Anything wider on x86-64
// (AVX/AVX2's 256 bits) is a CPU-feature question, not an architecture
// question, and belongs behind a cpuid dispatch this seam deliberately does
// not have - see docs/building.md.
//
// WHY IT IS THIS SMALL. Every kernel that uses the seam lives ONCE, in
// shared code (mdct.cpp's dct4_scaled and IMDCT twiddle stages,
// bitalloc.cpp's exponents_to_psd, exponents.cpp's to_fixed25_block,
// fft.cpp's dft512 normalisation), written against these types. The
// per-architecture directories carry the type and its operations, not a
// copy of each kernel. That is what makes the bit-exactness argument
// tractable: every operation below maps to a single IEEE-754
// add/subtract/multiply (or a single exact integer operation) per lane, so
// a kernel written against f64x2 performs exactly the operations, in
// exactly the order, that the scalar loop it replaced performed -
// tests/ac3/core/test_simd_kernels.cpp asserts that bit-for-bit for every
// primitive here, and the kernels built from them inherit the guarantee
// rather than needing their own bit-exact unit test (see that file's own
// header comment). The FFT (iclforge/dsp/detail/fft_stockham.hpp)
// is NOT part of this seam - it is an algorithmic change, not a
// wider-lane one, and carries its own correctness argument.
//
// FUSED MULTIPLY-ADD is the one way that argument can fail, and it is
// disabled project-wide rather than worked around here: the top-level
// CMakeLists.txt pins -ffp-contract=off. See that file's own comment, and
// docs/building.md's "Floating-point contraction" section.
//
// NaN is out of contract for every operation below. Nothing in the codec
// core produces one (the fuzz harnesses assert that at the API boundary),
// round_ties_away propagates it because the instruction sequences happen to,
// and no other member of the seam makes a promise about it.
