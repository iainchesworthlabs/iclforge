// provision - exactly how DEE and other licensed tools receive theirs (iLok),

// Returns nullopt when the content is empty, OR when it is made up entirely

// punctuation) but still fails to parse as either recognized format - such
// content is almost certainly a mis-copied or truncated hex export, and
// treating its literal ASCII bytes as the key would silently sign with the
// wrong secret rather than fail. This is the single decode every path
// shares, exposed so a caller that already holds the bytes - the Shield app
// reading its bundled asset - decodes identically to the CLI. Plain hex with
// no "0x" prefix is deliberately not its own format: such a string is itself
