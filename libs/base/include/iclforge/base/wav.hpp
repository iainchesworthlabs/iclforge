// WAV reading and writing, shared by the CLI and the GUI so neither carries
// its own copy.
//
// Reading accepts what a professional delivery actually arrives as:
// WAVE_FORMAT_PCM at 8, 16, 24 or 32 bits, WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT at 32 or
// 64, either of those wrapped in WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE, and the RF64 (EBU
// Tech 3306) / BW64 (ITU-R BS.2088-1) container whose ds64 chunk carries
// 64-bit sizes for files past RIFF's 4 GB ceiling. Every depth converts to
// the same [-1, 1) floats, so nothing downstream of a reader knows or cares
// which it was. 24-bit in particular is the normal professional interchange
// depth, and needing a pre-conversion pass before this encoder could touch
// one was the gap this widening closed.
//
// Writing stays deliberately narrow - float32 (write_wav_f32,
// WavStreamWriter) and raw PCM16 passthrough (write_wav_pcm16_raw,
// WavPcm16StreamWriter) - because those are the only two shapes this project
// produces: decoded audio, and an IEC 61937 burst carrier.
