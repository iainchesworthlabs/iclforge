// iclforge::audio::PlaybackCounter against a fake device's clock
// (libs/audio/include/iclforge/audio/playback_counter.hpp).
//
// The counter is the platform-independent half of MonitorPosition: every
// backend hands it the frames it has given the device and the frames the
// device says it still holds, and what a caller reads back follows from those
// two. So a fake device with a clock of its own - it takes frames, plays them
// at whatever rate the test chooses, and reports what it has left - drives the
// same code the real backends do, which is what A2's exit asks for. What no
// test on a build machine can check is the platform call each backend reads
// its two numbers FROM; that is what the receiver and the Pi are for.
