// iclforge::audio::PcmOutput's two decisions, against fake device records
// (src/audio/src/pcm_output.cpp): how wide to open the stream, and which
// output each rendered channel goes to.
//
// No device is opened here. Both decisions are made from a RenderDeviceInfo,
// which is a plain record the enumeration fills in, so a fake one puts every
// case - an 8-channel HDMI endpoint, a stereo jack, a backend that cannot say
// how many channels it has - in front of the same code the real enumeration
// feeds. The scatter itself belongs to iclforge::render::Routing and is tested in
// tests/render/test_routing.cpp; playing through a real device is
// test_monitor_live.cpp's [.][monitor-live] case and the receiver.
