// Windows CI runner has WASAPI/COM available (they are core OS components,
// not drivers), so the only thing this file cannot exercise is what
// ComScope/make_enumerator actually touch - COM itself, and whatever
// endpoints happen to be attached. What is left, and worth testing on its
// own, is stream_gone(): a pure HRESULT classifier, the same shape
// libs/audio/tests/backend/android/test_android_support.cpp's track_is_dead() is for
// AudioTrack.write()'s return value.
//
// CMake adds this file to the suite only when it selected the windows/
// platform directory, and puts that directory on the include path - the same
// selection libs/audio/tests/backend/alsa, libs/audio/tests/backend/android and libs/audio/tests/backend/macos
// already use for their own backend's internal header.
