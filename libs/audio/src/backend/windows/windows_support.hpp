// The handful of things capture.cpp, device_watcher.cpp, monitor.cpp and
// passthrough.cpp all need from WASAPI/COM, kept in one place so the four
// cannot drift - the same role alsa_support.hpp plays for the ALSA backend
// (see its own header comment), coreaudio_support.hpp for CoreAudio, and
// pipewire_support.hpp for PipeWire.
//
// Before this existed, ComScope and the CLSID_MMDeviceEnumerator/IID byte
// arrays below were hand-copied into each Windows backend file that needed
// them, capture.cpp's own copies being the ones the others' comments pointed
// back to ("same as capture.cpp's") rather than actually sharing. That the
// copies can drift is not hypothetical: monitor.cpp and passthrough.cpp each
// grew their own "the render device went away under me" detection
// independently, on their own schedules, and disagreed on which HRESULT
// codes end the stream - see stream_gone()'s own comment below for what
// that disagreement is and why part of it is intentional rather than a bug.
//
// spatial.cpp is not wired to this header yet. It duplicates ComScope and
// the two enumerator constants the same way the other four once did, and its
// render loop does not check for device loss at all today - see
// stream_gone()'s own comment for the shape that would need.

// use this narrow allowlist to tell apart from an actual loss - anything
// else FAILED() reports is treated as the driver being uncooperative rather

// passthrough.cpp (exclusive mode) is this predicate's original and current
// caller, around GetCurrentPadding: real hardware has been seen to decline
// that call without the device having gone - see docs/platforms/windows.md -
// so only these two codes end the stream there.

// monitor.cpp's shared-mode GetCurrentPadding checks deliberately do NOT
// call this, and that is not an oversight this header should paper over: a
// shared-mode stream always answers for its padding (monitor.cpp's own
// comment on the point), so there a refusal for ANY reason already means the
// stream is over, and narrowing that check to this allowlist would silently
// stop noticing a real loss that happens to fail a different way. The two
// backends are answering different questions that happen to look like the
// same call.

// has no equivalent of monitor.cpp's/passthrough.cpp's `lost` flag today.
// Its ISpatialAudioClient is activated off the same IMMDevice/audio engine
// as the other two, and Microsoft's own reference pages for
// BeginUpdatingAudioObjects/GetAvailableDynamicObjectCount list the same
// AUDCLNT_E_DEVICE_INVALIDATED endpoint-removal code this predicate already
// matches, so it is the plausible starting point once that loop gains one -

// loop needed a different one from passthrough.cpp's exclusive-mode loop.
