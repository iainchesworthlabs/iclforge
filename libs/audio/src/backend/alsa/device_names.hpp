// Everything the ALSA backend does with device names and IEC 60958 channel
// status, expressed without touching libasound.
//
// It lives in its own header for one reason: it is the part of the backend
// that can be tested on a machine with no sound card, no ALSA configuration
// and - since nothing here includes <alsa/asoundlib.h> - no libasound at all.
// libs/audio/tests/backend/alsa/test_alsa_device_names.cpp covers it, and CMake adds
// that file to the suite in the same breath as it selects this directory.
//
// The subject is the one thing ALSA does differently from WASAPI. WASAPI has a
// non-PCM *format* (KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_IEC61937_DOLBY_DIGITAL) that a driver
// either accepts or refuses. ALSA has no such format: an IEC 61937 burst
// stream is opened as ordinary 16-bit stereo PCM, and what tells the receiver
// on the far end of the cable that these bytes are a Dolby Digital bitstream
// rather than music is the *channel status* carried alongside the samples -
// specifically the non-audio bit, AES0 bit 1 of IEC 60958. Getting that bit
// wrong does not fail; it plays the bitstream as noise at full scale.
//
// alsa-lib sets those bits from arguments on the device name, which is why
// this file is about strings: "iec958:CARD=PCH,DEV=0" is a device, and
// "iec958:CARD=PCH,DEV=0,AES0=0x06,AES1=0x82,AES2=0x00,AES3=0x02" is that
// device carrying a non-audio 48 kHz stream.

// "Representing Formats for IEC 61937 Transmissions" states it as a
// requirement; the Windows backend applies it by building a 4x
// WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE, and this backend by opening the device at 4x. AC-4
// runs its link at the content rate, and its HBR4 bursts at 4x like E-AC-3's
// (IEC 61937-14 5.3.1 and 5.3.3): audio::carrier_ratio() has every format's.
