// machine, in card then device order, with both the alsa-lib device name
// (CARD=/DEV= carries a config-relative logical index - "hdmi:DEV=0" is the
// card's first HDMI PCM whatever hardware device number it happens to have)
// and the raw hardware device index device_names.hpp's own comment warns not
// to confuse it with. sink_capabilities.cpp needs the raw index because that,
// not the logical one, is what /proc/asound/card<N>/eld#<dev>.<port> is keyed
// by - see eld_proc.hpp.
//
// Header-only and libasound-light in the same spirit as alsa_support.hpp:
// only <alsa/asoundlib.h> for snd_pcm_stream_t, which for_each_pcm already
