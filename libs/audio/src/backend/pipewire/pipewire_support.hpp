// The pid is **not on the node**, which is the thing worth writing down: a
// Stream/Output/Audio node carries application.name, media.class and a
// client.id, and nothing else about who owns it. The process lives on the
// **Client** object that client.id names. Reading application.process.id off
// the node - the obvious thing, and the wrong thing - matches nothing at all,
// so a tap keyed on it never finds a process and a session list is always
// empty. Both happened, and neither shows up without a real session to walk.
//
// Of the two pids the Client carries, pipewire.sec.pid is the one the daemon
// took from the socket credentials, while application.process.id is whatever
// the client said about itself. The credentials are the better answer right
// up until the socket belongs to a **relay**, and on a desktop it usually
// does: pipewire-pulse speaks the PulseAudio protocol on one side and the
// native one on the other, so every application that uses the Pulse API -
// VLC, Firefox, Chromium, Spotify, most of a Debian desktop - reaches the
// daemon through that one process, and every one of their Clients carries
// pipewire-pulse's pid. Taking it at face value gives a session list with a
// single entry called pipewire-pulse however many applications are playing,
// and a per-process tap that matches none of them. Measured on a Raspberry
// Pi 4B, 2026-09-05: VLC's Client said pipewire.sec.pid 32005, which was
// pipewire-pulse; VLC itself was 49692.
//
// The relay says so on each node it creates: client.api, a registry key, is
// "pipewire-pulse" there and absent or "pipewire" for a native client. Where
// it names a relay the credentials describe the relay rather than the
// application, and application.process.id - which pipewire-pulse copies from
// the Pulse client's own proplist - is the pid that means something. That
// key is not in the registry subset either, so those nodes are bound for
// their info whatever identity depth the caller asked for: a wrong pid is
// not an identity nicety, it is the difference between a tap that works and
// one that captures silence.
//
// The icon identity is the second thing the registry dictionary lacks (see
// StreamIdentity), so this is a bind-for-info walk in the shape of
// audio_sinks_with_info(): the registry pass records the facts it always
// did - target, application.name, client.id, the Client's pid - and
// additionally binds each stream node and each Client; a second sync waits
// for the info events those binds provoke. The registry facts never depend
// on a bind: a machine where a bind fails, or a server that sends no info,
// yields the list this function returned before, with the three identity
// fields empty. A core error, or a first sync that never comes back, is the
// other case: nothing is returned at all, as the registry-only walk did.
//
// Cost, measured on a Raspberry Pi 4B on 2026-09-05: the binds and the
// second round trip take about a second there with a graph of a few dozen
// objects. The Linux session monitor pays it twice a second on a thread of
// its own and does not care; the tap does, because Capture::
// start_process_loopback calls this from the engine's frame thread, where a
// second is thirty dropped frames. So the identity is asked for rather than
// assumed: kRegistryOnly, the default, binds nothing it does not have to -
// only the relayed nodes above, and only because their pid is wrong without
// it - and the session monitor, which needs an icon name for every stream,
// asks for kWithInfo. A graph with no Pulse application in it costs
