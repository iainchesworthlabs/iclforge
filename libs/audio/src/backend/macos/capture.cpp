#include "iclforge/audio/capture.hpp"

// The macOS capture backend. CMake compiles this directory's capture.cpp
// under APPLE and another platform directory's everywhere else, so there is
// no #ifdef here - the file's path is what says "macOS".
//
// This is the CoreAudio Audio HAL (AudioObjectID / AudioDeviceIOProc) - the
// same layer passthrough.cpp uses, not the higher-level AVAudioEngine or
// Audio Queue Services APIs. That choice mirrors why platform/alsa is ALSA
// rather than PulseAudio/PipeWire (see platform/alsa/passthrough.cpp's own
// header): passthrough's exclusive-mode physical-format switch has to
// happen at the HAL, so the HAL is where device enumeration, hog mode and
// format negotiation all live in one place (coreaudio_support.hpp), and
// capture sharing that layer means it shares that code rather than talking
// to a second, higher-level API with its own device model. AVAudioEngine
// also has no equivalent to a persistent per-endpoint UID the way
// kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceUID gives every HAL object, which every
// DeviceInfo.id in this project's other backends already assumes is stable
// across a session (see capture.hpp).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Loopback
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Unlike WASAPI (any render endpoint reopened in loopback mode) or PipeWire
// (a sink's monitor, targeted via stream.capture.sink), there is no HAL-level
// "capture what a render device is playing" - the Audio HAL this file already
// uses for real input has no loopback concept at all. So enumerate_devices()
// below reports every real input endpoint and no loopback ones, and start()
// refuses DeviceKind::kLoopback outright rather than silently substituting a
// microphone. That is the same category of gap platform/alsa/capture.cpp
// documents for a machine with no snd-aloop module loaded: the honest answer
// rather than a failure.
//
// What macOS 14.2 does provide is the PER-PROCESS tap, and
// start_process_loopback() at the bottom of this file is built on it: a
// CATapDescription over one audio process object, carried by a private
// aggregate device whose IOProc reads exactly the way a real input device's
// does. process_tap.hpp and process_tap.mm hold the Objective-C++ half -
// CATapDescription has no C entry point - and describe the three objects
// involved. What belongs here is what a CALLER of Capture sees, which is three
// places where this backend's contract is narrower than the Windows one it is
// modelled on (see CONTRIBUTING.md's "Where behaviour is deliberately
// narrower than the standard, say so and say why"), plus a fourth where what
// it REPORTS differs rather than what it promises:
//
//   - ONE PROCESS, NOT A TREE. ProcessLoopbackMode::kIncludeProcessTree is
//     honoured as "this process", kExcludeProcessTree as "everything except
//     this process". Windows' activation walks the target's children because
//     a browser renders its audio from a utility process under the browser;
//     a CATapDescription takes a list of audio process objects with no
//     descendant relation for it to follow, so there is nothing here to walk.
//     A caller that wants a browser's audio has to name the process that is
//     playing it. PipeWire's tap has the same property for its own reason
//     (see docs/crucible/design/promotion.md's Phase 4 record), so Windows is the
//     only one of the three backends with a tap where that mode name is
//     literal.
//
//   - MONO OR STEREO, AND NOTHING ELSE. WASAPI's activation lets a caller
//     state any WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE and has the audio engine convert to it;
//     a CATapDescription's mixdown descriptions are mono and stereo, with no
//     converter behind them at all. ProcessLoopbackFormat::channels of 1 or 2
//     is accepted and anything else - including the eight channels
//     capture.hpp offers so a surround-rendering application's tap reaches a
//     bed intact - is refused with kFormatUnsupported rather than quietly
//     delivering two and letting the caller believe it asked for them.
//
//   - THE RATE IS THE MACHINE'S, AND IS CHECKED RATHER THAN CONVERTED. A
//     mixdown tap runs at the rate of the device it mixes down to, which
//     neither this code nor its caller chose. capture.hpp promises samples
//     land in the ring "at exactly `format`", so a tap whose own
//     kAudioTapPropertyFormat disagrees with what was asked for is refused
//     with kFormatUnsupported. The alternative - taking it anyway and
//     reporting the true rate through sample_rate() - would keep more
//     machines working at the price of the one promise that header makes,
//     and a caller that had already sized an encoder from the number it
//     passed in would be the one to discover the difference.
//
//   - NO SILENCE IS SYNTHESISED, and this is the bullet to distrust. The
//     Windows and PipeWire taps poll and fill wall-clock gaps because a quiet
//     process delivers no packets at all. The aggregate device here is clocked
//     by the output device it names as its main sub-device rather than by the
//     tapped application, so on the API's own account its IOProc is called
//     every device period whether that application is playing or not, the
//     timeline advances on its own, and CaptureStats::frames_silence_filled
//     stays zero for a tap as it already does for a real input device. That
//     reading of the API has not been observed to be right - no Mac has run
//     this - and it is the assumption most likely to be wrong, because a tap
//     that instead delivers nothing while its process is quiet would need the
//     wall-clock fill the other two backends have and this file has not
//     written.
//
// Two things this file cannot answer, and neither of them is a code question.
// Creating a tap raises a TCC consent prompt under its own permission
// category (SystemAudioCaptureRequests, driven by an
// NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription Info.plist key, separate from microphone
// access); that prompt is keyed to the requesting binary's code-signing
// identity and, per every report surveyed while writing this, never fires at
// all for an unsigned binary - and forge/forge-gui/Crucible ship unsigned today
// (macOS code signing, blocked on certificates). A denial and a prompt that never
// appeared both arrive here as one refusal from AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap
// and are reported as kComFailure, because the API offers nothing to tell
// them apart. And no Mac has ever run any of this backend (DR9): what is
// claimed for everything past this comment is that it compiles, which is the
// whole of the claim and is why nothing below says "verified" or "works".
// See docs/platforms/macos.md.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// No worker thread
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// See coreaudio_support.hpp's own header comment: the IOProc callback both
// start paths below register runs on a realtime thread the OS owns (between
// AudioDeviceStart and AudioDeviceStop), not one this library spawned -
// there is no jthread field in Impl the way the ALSA/Windows backends each
// have one. It is a static member of Impl rather than a free function or a
// lambda - see Impl::io_proc's own comment for why. The Windows tap needs a
// polling thread of its own to synthesise silence for a quiet process; this
// one does not, because the aggregate device carrying the tap is clocked
// whether the tapped application is playing or not.
