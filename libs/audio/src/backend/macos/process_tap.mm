#include "process_tap.hpp"

// The Objective-C++ half of the macOS process tap. See process_tap.hpp for
// why this file exists at all, for what is and is not claimed about it, and
// for the C++ interface it implements.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The shape of a Core Audio process tap
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Three objects, created in this order and destroyed in the reverse of it:
//
//   1. An audio PROCESS OBJECT. The HAL gives every audio client an
//      AudioObjectID of its own; kAudioHardwarePropertyTranslatePIDToProcessObject
//      turns a unix process id into one. This is the only place in the
//      backend that passes qualifier data to AudioObjectGetPropertyData (the
//      pid is the qualifier, the object id is the answer), which is why it is
//      written out here rather than reached through coreaudio_support.hpp's
//      get_property<T>.
//
//   2. The TAP itself, AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap over a CATapDescription.
//      The description is the Objective-C object this whole translation unit
//      exists for. It carries the process list, the mixdown shape, a UUID we
//      choose (so that step 3 can name this tap), and the mute behaviour.
//
//   3. A private AGGREGATE DEVICE that carries the tap. A tap is not a device
//      and has no IOProc of its own; the way audio comes out of one is to
//      build an aggregate device whose kAudioAggregateDeviceTapListKey names
//      it, and then register an ordinary AudioDeviceIOProcID on that device -
//      which is exactly what capture.cpp already does for a real input
//      device, so the read side needs nothing new.
//
// The aggregate's main sub-device is the current default output device, and
// that device also appears in its sub-device list. That is the arrangement
// every published implementation of this API surveyed while writing this file
// uses (Apple's own audio-tap sample and the widely-copied AudioCap project
// both build the dictionary this way), and the reason is clocking: a tap
// carries no clock, so the aggregate is timed by the device the tapped
// application was playing to in the first place. kAudioAggregateDeviceIsPrivateKey
// keeps the device out of every other process's device list, including the
// user's Sound preferences, so tapping an application does not leave a
// stray "Aggregate Device" behind for someone to wonder about.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// muteBehavior, and why this platform needs no silent device
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CATapMutedWhenTapped mutes the tapped application at the point the tap
// takes its audio: the application keeps rendering, this process receives the
// samples, and nothing reaches the speakers by the ordinary path. On Windows
// and Linux the equivalent effect needs a silent device to move applications
// on to - an installed driver on one, a PipeWire node created at run time on
// the other - and moving the default output is a visible change to the user's
// machine that has to be explained and undone. Here the mute rides on the tap
// itself, so nothing in the sound settings changes and there is nothing to
// restore on quit. What it mutes is whatever the description covers, which
// for TapScope::kEverythingExceptListedProcess is every other application on
// the machine - see create_process_tap()'s comment in process_tap.hpp, where
// that consequence is spelled out for the caller who chooses the scope.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Memory management
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file is compiled with -fobjc-arc (see the APPLE block of
// libs/audio/CMakeLists.txt), so the Objective-C objects below are released by
// the compiler and the toll-free bridge to CFDictionaryRef is spelled
// __bridge. The @autoreleasepool is not decoration: create_process_tap() is
// called from whatever thread the caller happens to be on, which on this
// project's callers is never the main thread and therefore never has a run
// loop draining a pool for it.
