// The macOS backend's pure half: everything here is ordinary arithmetic and
// struct inspection over types <CoreAudio/CoreAudio.h> defines, with no
// AudioObjectGetPropertyData/AudioObjectSetPropertyData call - or any other
// live round-trip to the HAL - anywhere in the file. The include itself is
// the full umbrella header rather than the narrower <CoreAudio/CoreAudioTypes.h>
// only because AudioStreamRangedDescription (find_physical_format's own
// currency) is declared in AudioHardwareBase.h, not CoreAudioTypes.h - a
// function-declarations-only header is not a live device the way an actual
// AudioObjectGetPropertyData call would be, so this file's claim to being
// "pure" is about behaviour (nothing here ever touches a device), not about
// which sub-header a type happens to live in.
//
// Unlike platform/alsa/device_names.hpp, whose whole point is testability on
// a machine that might not have libasound installed, what this file is pure
// OF is a live HAL round-trip, not a library that might be missing:
// CoreAudio.framework's headers ship with every macOS SDK, so there is no
// "not installed" story here to design around. libs/audio/tests/backend/macos/
// test_macos_support.cpp covers this file directly, on real macOS CI, the
// same role libs/audio/tests/backend/alsa/test_alsa_device_names.cpp plays for
// device_names.hpp.
//
// coreaudio_support.hpp next door is the impure half: property fetching,
// device enumeration, hog mode, and the async wait a physical-format or
// nominal-rate change needs before it can be trusted.
//
// The process-tap version floor below is a third kind of "pure": it never
// touches CoreAudio.framework at all, just the OS version - but that makes it
// no less pure by this file's own definition (no live round-trip to a
// device), so it lives here rather than earning its own header for two
// constants and a function. See capture.cpp's own "Loopback" section, and
// process_tap.hpp, for what it is for.

// so that one translation unit is Objective-C++; see process_tap.hpp).
//
// What is written down once here is the ARGUMENT for the number, and the one
// sentence a refused caller is shown. The number itself is not, and cannot
// be: three of the four places that name it - system_audio_tap_api_available()
// below, process_tap.mm's @available guard, and the API_AVAILABLE annotations
// on the functions behind it - spell the version as a token the compiler
// reads at parse time, not as a value it can take from a constant. The fourth
// is the refusal sentence, which has to read as English and so carries the
// version as text. So the number appears in four places by necessity, and
// what holds them together is a check rather than a definition:
// libs/audio/tests/backend/macos/test_macos_support.cpp asserts that the refusal
// sentence names the version kSystemAudioTapMinimumOs does, and that the two
// reports of the refusal are the same string. Neither of those can catch an
// @available guard left behind at an older version - that one has to be moved
// by hand, and the list above is here so that whoever moves the floor knows
// how many places to look.
//
// 14.2, not 14.4, and the choice is worth recording because both figures are
// in circulation. Apple's SDK annotates the tap API API_AVAILABLE(macos(14.2)),
// which is the version __builtin_available and @available compile against and
// the version the weak-linked symbols are keyed to - so 14.2 is where the API
// is present by the operating system's own account. Several third-party
// write-ups, and at least one widely-copied sample project, require 14.4
// instead, on reports of taps misbehaving on 14.2 and 14.3. Taking 14.4 here
// would mean refusing a machine whose OS declares the API present, on the
// strength of a report nobody on this project can check: no Mac has ever run
// this backend (ROADMAP.md DR9), and neither figure has been observed to be
// right or wrong here. So the floor follows the SDK, and this comment records
// the other number rather than losing it. If a 14.2 or 14.3 machine is ever
// found to misbehave, this is the constant to move, and the four places
// listed above move with it. Chosen 2026-09-06.

// Silicon macOS CI leg (macOS 26.6.2). Creating the tap succeeded, creating
// the private aggregate device succeeded, reading the tap's format succeeded
// - and then AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID on that aggregate never returned.
// `sample` caught it three times in three separate processes, in every case
// parked in mach_msg2_trap inside
// HALC_ProxyIOContext::_TellServerAboutStreamUsage, waiting on a reply from
// coreaudiod that did not come within ctest's 300-second limit. Worse than
// the tap simply not working: while that request was outstanding the whole
// process's HAL client was unusable, so an ordinary
// AudioObjectGetPropertyData on ANOTHER thread - Crucible's window, asking
// for the device list - blocked behind it, and the application froze rather
// than reporting that a tap had failed.
//
// So this backend does not make that call by default. Nothing above it can
// bound a synchronous HAL round trip, and there is no property to ask first:
// every precondition the API documents was satisfied on the machine where it
// hung. What CAN be said honestly is that no machine has been seen to
// complete it, and a capability report that says "available" on the strength
// of a version test alone was the thing that turned out to be wrong.
//
// The macOS 15.7.9 Intel leg ran the same code without hanging on the same
// day, which is why this is not written as "macOS cannot do this": what is
// known is that one host wedged and no host has ever produced a sample
// through a tap. Two variables separate those legs, the OS version and the
// architecture, and nothing here can say which matters.
//
// ICLFORGE_MACOS_PROCESS_TAP in the environment turns the path back on for
// whoever has a Mac to settle it on. Read once, at first use, because
// audio_backend()'s table is built once per process; it is a decision about
