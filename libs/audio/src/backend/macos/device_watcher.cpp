#include "iclforge/audio/device_watcher.hpp"

// The Core Audio device watcher: HAL property listeners on the system object.
// CMake compiles this directory's device_watcher.cpp under APPLE and another
// platform directory's everywhere else, so there is no #ifdef here - the
// file's path is what says "macOS".
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Three listeners, four events
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Everything this file needs is a property of kAudioObjectSystemObject, so
// there is no per-device registration to keep in step with a device list the
// way a naive reading of the header's DeviceChange enum might suggest:
//
//   kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices             -> kAdded / kRemoved
//   kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice -> kDefaultRenderChanged
//   kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultInputDevice  -> kDefaultCaptureChanged
//
// The first of those is the one with work behind it. IMMNotificationClient
// hands Windows separate OnDeviceAdded/OnDeviceRemoved calls and PipeWire's
// registry hands out global/global_remove; Core Audio says only "the device
// list changed" and leaves the caller to work out what changed, so this
// keeps the previous list of device UIDs and diffs against it - the same
// bookkeeping the PipeWire watcher's `nodes` map does, for the opposite
// reason (there, to recover an id the removal event does not carry).
//
// kStateChanged is never raised here, and that is a difference rather than
// an omission. It exists because a Windows endpoint can stay in the
// enumerator while becoming disabled, unplugged or not-present; a HAL device
// that goes away leaves kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices, which is already
// reported as kRemoved. A caller that re-probes on kAdded/kRemoved sees
// everything this platform has to say.
//
// The default-INPUT listener is a third registration where Crucible cross-platform promotion's
// plan for this backend named two. It is here because DeviceChange has a
// kDefaultCaptureChanged case that both other backends raise - Windows from
// OnDefaultDeviceChanged with eCapture, PipeWire from the metadata key
// default.audio.source - and a watcher that could never raise it would be the
// odd one of the three, for the cost of one more address in the array below.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Which thread a callback arrives on
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The HAL's, not this library's: there is no jthread field below the way the
// Windows watcher has one, for the same reason capture.cpp has none (see
// coreaudio_support.hpp's "No worker thread"). Unlike the IOProc that file
// registers, this is NOT a realtime thread - it is the HAL's notification
// thread, so the property reads snapshot() makes and the std::string it
// allocates are allowed here, which is what lets the diff happen where the
// event does.
//
// Nothing here writes kAudioHardwarePropertyRunLoop, and that is a decision
// rather than an oversight. The HAL's older listener API delivered on the
// process's MAIN run loop, so a program that never runs one - forge, a test
// binary - would register and then never hear anything, and setting that
// property to a null CFRunLoopRef is the lever that asks for a dedicated
// notification thread instead. Three reasons it is not pulled here. It is
// process-wide, so a library reaching for it decides the question for
// whatever else is in the process. AudioObjectAddPropertyListener, the API
// used below, is the newer of the two and is documented as delivering on a
// thread the HAL owns, so on the deployment target this project builds for
// (13.3, cmake/toolchains/macos.llvm.toolchain.cmake) the lever should have
// nothing to change. And that selector carries a deprecation annotation in
// recent SDKs - which nobody on this project can check, having no Mac (DR9) -
// where -Wdeprecated-declarations under this project's -Werror would turn a
// best-effort call that nothing depends on into a red build on both macOS
// legs. If notifications turn out not to arrive in a process with no run
// loop, that property is the thing to set, and this paragraph is why it was
// left out first. Decided 2026-09-06.
//
// Delivery is under `mutex`, and the whole handler runs under it rather than
// only the callback invocation, because the diff reads and rewrites the
// device list that stop() is entitled to tear down from another thread. That
// single lock is also what lets stop() promise the header's guarantee: it
// unregisters first, so the HAL stops calling, then takes the lock and clears
// the callback, so anything already inside the handler has finished and
// anything that was waiting on the lock finds nothing to call. Exactly the
// shape platform/windows/device_watcher.cpp's Listener::disarm() has.
//
// Be precise about what that buys, because the header's sentence is easy to
// over-read. What is guaranteed is that the CALLER'S callback is not invoked
// again once stop() has returned: it is cleared under the lock, and every
// path to it checks. What is not guaranteed, because the API gives no way to
// ask for it, is that no HAL thread is still somewhere inside handle() taking
// that lock - AudioObjectRemovePropertyListener stops future dispatches and
// says nothing about one already dispatched. Impl outlives stop() in every
// case this class allows (the destructor calls stop() before ~Impl runs), so
// the mutex it is blocking on is still there; a caller that could destroy the
// watcher from a second thread the instant stop() returned on a first is the
// case this shape does not cover, and the header already tells a caller not
// to drive it that way.
//
// This runs on CI and on nobody's desk. The library's own device-watcher
// contract case starts and stops a watcher on both macOS runners, and since
// 2026-09-06 the Crucible Qt Quick suites do too, through the engine's
// watcher.start() - so registration, unregistration and the stop() ordering
// below execute. What has never been observed is a NOTIFICATION: a hosted
// runner's device list does not change while a test runs, so handle(),
// diff_devices() and every emit() in this file are still unexecuted, and
// nothing here is a report of what they do. Written 2026-09-06.
