#include "iclforge/audio/monitor.hpp"

// The macOS monitor backend. CMake compiles this directory's monitor.cpp
// under APPLE and another platform directory's everywhere else, so there is
// no #ifdef here - the file's path is what says "macOS".
//
// This is meant to be the easy one, and for the same reason it is easy on
// Windows/ALSA: a preview wants to share the output with everything else on
// the machine rather than demand the hardware exactly. Where this backend
// differs is channel count and sample rate, and for a reason neither of the
// other two has: a raw HAL device has no audio-engine layer of its own to
// adapt a foreign format the way WASAPI shared mode does, and no `plug`-
// style conversion plugin to fall through to the way ALSA does - the
// physical device itself runs at exactly one nominal sample rate at a time.
// So this backend requires an exact channel-count match (no downmix/upmix
// matrix of its own, the same limit platform/alsa/monitor.cpp documents for
// itself) and, if the device's CURRENT nominal rate does not match the
// caller's, asks the device to retune via kAudioDevicePropertyNominalSampleRate
// - the same kind of asynchronous-settle wait passthrough.cpp needs for its
// own, very different reason (see that file's header and
// coreaudio_support.hpp's wait_for_nominal_rate). Device-wide and thus not
// perfectly "shared" in WASAPI's sense, but no worse in kind than what
// passthrough.cpp already does, and unavoidable at this API layer - a
// device already running at 44.1 or 48 kHz (by far the common case) never
// touches this path at all.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// No worker thread
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// See coreaudio_support.hpp's own header comment: the IOProc callback
// start() registers below runs on a realtime thread the OS owns, not one
// this library spawned - there is no jthread field in Impl the way the
// ALSA/Windows backends each have one. It is a captureless lambda defined
// inside start() itself, not a free function - see platform/macos/capture.cpp's
// own start() for why (the private Impl type is only reachable from there).
