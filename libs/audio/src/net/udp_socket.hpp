// A UDP socket: bind to a local IPv4 address, block-with-timeout for one
// datagram, send one, close - LivePositionSource itself only ever needs the
// receiving half; send_to() exists for the test suite (see its own comment
// below). Pimpl'd
// like every other OS-facing type in this library (Capture, MonitorSink,
// PassthroughSink - see capture.hpp's own struct Impl/unique_ptr shape) -
// not a virtual interface, since this codebase's platform seam has never
// been one.
//
// Its own small platform tree, libs/audio/src/net/{posix,windows}/ - a
// SECOND axis from libs/audio/src/backend/<backend>/, deliberately, not a
// fifth file added to every one of that tree's six directories. See
// libs/audio/CMakeLists.txt's own comment on the net/ block for why: the
// backend axis is the AUDIO SUBSYSTEM (WASAPI vs ALSA vs PipeWire vs
// CoreAudio genuinely differ), sockets are the OPERATING SYSTEM (Berkeley
// sockets are one implementation across Linux/macOS/Android; only Windows
// differs), and folding one into the other would mean five near-identical
// copies of the same POSIX file.
//
// Internal - not installed under include/ac3/audio/. Nothing outside
// live_positions.cpp needs a socket type at all.
