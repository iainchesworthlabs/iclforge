// Detects a capture device that has stopped delivering audio. A read loop
// polling a vanished device (unplugged, disabled, the endpoint torn down
// under it) sees nothing but zero-byte reads forever - `while (got == 0)
// sleep 2ms` alone never learns the difference between "briefly starved" and
// "gone", so a live session just sits there reading "Running" with nothing
// coming in. This tracks time since the last non-empty read and answers
// whether that gap has crossed a threshold; the read loop decides what
// "stop the session" means, this only decides when.
//
// Header-only and Qt-free (matches BasicRingBuffer's own shape in
// ring_buffer.hpp) so it is usable from a plain Catch2 test without pulling
// in anything platform-specific, and the caller drives the clock explicitly
// rather than this reading it itself - a test can then advance time in exact
// steps instead of sleeping for real.
