// Reading a render endpoint's own advertised capabilities - CEA-861 Short
// Audio Descriptors, the part of EDID (over HDMI) or ELD (ALSA's own
// EDID-Like Data, which carries the same SADs) that says which codecs, how
// many channels and which sample rates the sink accepts - rather than
// PassthroughSink's enumerate_render_devices(), which finds out the AC-3/
// E-AC-3 answer by opening the device and trying.
//
// The two are deliberately kept apart. enumerate_render_devices() is a probe
// against every render endpoint at once and only ever answers "AC-3/E-AC-3/
// exclusive PCM, yes or no" - the CLI's 'outputs' table. This is a read of
// what ONE endpoint's own descriptor says, in more detail (sample rates,
// channel count), and it is not available everywhere: reading raw EDID/ELD
// content is a per-platform question with a real "cannot" answer on some
// platforms today (see each backend/<platform>/sink_capabilities.cpp), so a
// caller that wants the AC-3/E-AC-3/PCM question answered unconditionally
// should fall back to enumerate_render_devices() rather than treat kNoBackend
// as a hard failure - see 'forge play' (play/monitor follow mode) for that fallback.
