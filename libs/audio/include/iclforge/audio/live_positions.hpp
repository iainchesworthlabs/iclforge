// A live object-position source over OSC (live OSC object positions): a UDP listener on
// its own thread, feeding an iclforge::objects::oba::SceneCursor once per encoder frame.
// This is the socket-and-thread half; the OSC 1.0 wire form itself
// (iclforge::objects::oba::parse_osc_packet/apply, libs/ac3) is pure and portable, and
// lives in the distributed library instead - see that header's own comment
// for why the split falls where it does.
//
// The seam both front ends share: `forge live mode=atmos positions=osc:
// <port>` (apps/cli/commands/live_audio.cpp) and the GUI's live room
// (apps/gui/encoder_controller.cpp) each construct one of these and call
// drain_into() once per encode frame, exactly the way the GUI's live room
// already drains its own mutex-guarded manual-placement snapshot every
// frame - this generalises that established pattern rather than inventing a
// new one.
