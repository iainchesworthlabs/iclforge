// Lock-free single-producer / single-consumer ring buffer: one thread writes,
// one reads, with no locks, no allocation and no system calls once
// constructed, so an audio thread never blocks.
//
// Used in both directions: the WASAPI capture thread writes float samples for
// the encoder to drain, and the encoder writes IEC 61937 burst bytes for the
// exclusive-mode render thread to drain.
//
// Exactly one thread may write and one may read. Capacity is rounded up to a
// power of two so the index wrap is a mask rather than a modulo.
