// WASAPI loopback tap. An audio endpoint arriving, leaving, changing state or
// becoming the default: the events an application that follows the sink
// (docs/platforms/windows-demo.md, "Output modes and hot switching") needs
// in order to re-probe and switch outputs, instead of polling
// enumerate_render_devices() on a timer and hoping to notice.
//
// Three backends implement it, each over the notification mechanism its own
// audio system offers: Windows over IMMNotificationClient, Linux/PipeWire
// over the registry and the default.audio.sink/source metadata keys, and
// macOS over Core Audio property listeners on kAudioObjectSystemObject. ALSA
// has no such API (that is udev's job on Linux) and posix/android have no
// backend at all, so those three refuse start() with kNoBackend, the way the
// rest of this tree does - the API stays, the answer is no. Ask
// audio_backend().device_watch first if the answer wants to be a sentence
// rather than an error code.
//
// kStateChanged is a Windows event. An endpoint can stay in that
// enumerator while becoming disabled, unplugged or not-present, which is a
// state to report; on the other two an endpoint that goes away leaves the
// list, and kRemoved already says so.
