// Two-device live capture runs one WASAPI shared-mode endpoint as the
// session's clock master and a second as its slave - and shared-mode
// endpoints never share a hardware clock, even nominally-identical ones on
// the same PC, let alone a genuinely different device. Left alone, the
// slave's stream drifts against the master's a sample at a time: its FIFO
// toward the encoder either fills (slave running fast) or empties (slave
// running slow) until it over- or underruns, however good the two devices'
// individual clocks are on their own.
//
// This file is the pair of caller-driven, allocation-free pieces that
// correct that drift on the audio thread: DriftResampler applies a ratio to
// interleaved float PCM one render() call at a time, carrying only a
// fractional read position between calls; ClockDriftEstimator is the servo
// that turns a caller-owned FIFO's occupancy into the ratio DriftResampler
// should use next. Neither object owns a buffer or reads a clock itself -
// matching BasicRingBuffer's (ring_buffer.hpp) and SilenceWatchdog's
// (watchdog.hpp) own discipline of leaving ownership and timing entirely to
// the caller, so both are exercisable from a plain Catch2 test with
// synthetic data instead of a real device pair.
