// A render-device list that keeps itself current, however the platform says
// so - or does not.
//
// enumerate_render_devices() answers once, and DeviceWatcher reports that
// something changed on the three backends whose audio system has a
// notification mechanism (Windows, PipeWire, Core Audio). ALSA has none -
// that is udev's job on Linux - so a player that wants the receiver it was
// just plugged into to appear has to re-probe there instead. Both halves are
// the same job from a caller's point of view, so this is the one place that
// does it: notifications where they exist, a timer where they do not, and a
// list plus a generation either way.
//
// Two things it deliberately does NOT do on the platform's own notification
// thread: enumerate, and call the caller back. A WASAPI notification arrives
// on a thread inside the audio service's own COM apartment, and re-entering
// the enumerator from there is a documented way to deadlock; the same
// caution applies to a PipeWire loop thread and a Core Audio property
// listener. So an event only wakes this class's worker, which does the
// enumeration and the callback - a caller's callback therefore always runs
// on one thread it can reason about, and may take its own locks.
//
// Tested without a sound card in libs/audio/tests/test_render_devices.cpp, through
// the Sources seam below: an enumeration of the test's own and no platform
// watcher is exactly the shape ALSA runs in.
