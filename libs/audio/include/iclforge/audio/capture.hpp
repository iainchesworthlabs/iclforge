// real input endpoint (microphone, line in), a render endpoint opened in
// loopback mode, which captures whatever the machine is playing, or - roadmap
// UX11 - a process-loopback tap, which captures what one process (and its
// children) renders and nothing else, whichever endpoint it renders to.
//
// The capture thread only ever writes interleaved float samples into a
// RingBuffer; callers pull from that buffer at their own pace. Nothing on the
// capture side allocates, locks or blocks.

// stereo is the shape a live encoder wants; eight channels is granted too,
// and is how a surround-rendering application's tap reaches a bed intact.

// That is WASAPI's account of it, and it is the widest of the three. Core
// Audio has no converter behind a tap at all: its mixdown descriptions are
// mono and stereo, and a mixdown runs at the rate of the device it mixes down
// to rather than one the caller picks. So the macOS backend accepts channels
// of 1 or 2 and refuses anything else with kFormatUnsupported, and refuses a
// sample_rate its tap does not already deliver rather than resampling to it -
// which is how start_process_loopback()'s "at exactly `format`" below stays

// libs/audio/src/backend/macos/capture.cpp's own header comment, for the rest
