// What this build can do with the machine's audio hardware.
//
// Capture, passthrough and monitor playback are the only parts of iclforge
// that are not pure file I/O, and they are the only parts a platform can fail
// to provide. That makes "is this available here?" a question with a
// per-platform answer, and under the no-#ifdef rule a per-platform answer is
// a file in a platform directory - not a conditional at the call site.
//
// Exactly one src/audio/src/backend/<os>/audio_backend.cpp is compiled, chosen by
// CMake alongside that platform's capture.cpp, passthrough.cpp and
// monitor.cpp, so this report can never disagree with the implementations it
// describes. Callers read it as data: the CLI marks its usage listing from it
// and refuses the live-audio commands before running them, without naming an
// OS.

namespace iclforge::audio {

struct Capability {
    bool available = false;
    // Empty when available. Otherwise one line saying what is missing and
    // why, printed verbatim by whoever had to turn a caller away - so the
    // wording lives beside the implementation it is making excuses for.

    // Enumerating capture endpoints and reading samples from one:
    // iclforge::audio, behind the CLI's 'devices' and 'record'.
    Capability capture;
    // Enumerating render endpoints and bitstreaming to one in exclusive
    // mode: iclforge::audio, behind the CLI's 'outputs' and 'play'.
    //
    // Kept separate from capture rather than folded into one "audio" flag
    // because the two are separately hard: capture is an ordinary PCM stream,
    // while passthrough needs exclusive/hog-mode access to a device that will
    // accept a non-PCM format. A platform gaining one and not the other is
    // the expected order, not an edge case.
    Capability passthrough;
    // Enumerating render endpoints and playing ordinary shared-mode PCM to
    // one: iclforge::audio::MonitorSink, behind the CLI's 'monitor' and 'live
    // --monitor'. Closer in difficulty to capture than to passthrough (no
    // exclusive-mode format negotiation), but kept as its own flag for the
    // same reason capture and passthrough are separate: a platform can gain
    // this without gaining bitstreamed passthrough, or vice versa.
    Capability monitor;
    // Rendering decoded Atmos objects and bed through an OS object renderer
    // (Windows' ISpatialAudioObjectRenderStream): iclforge::audio::SpatialObjectSink,
    // behind the CLI's 'spatial'. "Available" here means the same thing it
    // does for the other three - this build has the code, not that any
    // particular endpoint on this machine currently has a spatial sound
    // format enabled. That per-endpoint question is start()'s own
    // SpatialError::kNoSpatialFormat, exactly parallel to passthrough's
    // per-device kFormatRejected split.
    Capability spatial;
    // Tapping one process's rendered audio on its own, whichever endpoint it
    // renders to: Capture::start_process_loopback (WASAPI loopback tap). Separate
    // from `capture` because a platform with an ordinary loopback path can
    // still lack a per-process one - and Windows itself does, before build
    // 20348 - so this is the one report that depends on the machine the
    // build is RUNNING on, not just the one it was compiled for. The same
    // answer, as a bool, is process_loopback_available().
    Capability process_loopback;
    // Being told when an endpoint arrives, leaves, changes state or becomes
    // the default, rather than polling for it: iclforge::audio::DeviceWatcher
    // (WASAPI loopback tap).
