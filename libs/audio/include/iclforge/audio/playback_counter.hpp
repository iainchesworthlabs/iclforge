// The arithmetic behind MonitorPosition, which is the same on every platform
// even though nothing else about the backends is.
//
// Each backend can obtain two numbers, both counted from the last start or
// flush: how many sample-frames it has handed the device, and how many of
// those the device has not played yet. WASAPI reads the second from
// GetCurrentPadding, ALSA from snd_pcm_delay, PipeWire from the queued and
// delay figures in pw_stream_get_time_n, Core Audio from the lead between the
// IOProc's two timestamps, AAudio from the gap between the frames written and
// the presentation position. Getting them is all that is platform-specific;
// what follows from them is not, and lives here - so a fake device's clock in
// iclforge-tests drives the same code the real backends do rather than a
// reimplementation of it.
//
// The device thread calls report(); a caller asking where playback has got to
// calls position() on its own thread. Two relaxed atomics rather than a lock:
// a reader that catches a new frame count beside an old unplayed count is out
// by less than one device period, no thread ever waits for another (a render
// callback must not wait for anything), and a device's own clock is not that
// precise to begin with. What must not happen - and cannot, since report()
// stores the difference rather than the reader subtracting one from the
// other - is a played count that runs backwards or wraps.
