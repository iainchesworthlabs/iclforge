// A PCM output at the device's own width, with each rendered channel placed
// where a routing patch says.
//
// MonitorSink opens a stream as wide as the CALLER asks and leaves the device
// to the platform: a 5.1 programme on an 8-channel HDMI endpoint becomes a
// six-channel shared-mode stream that Windows spreads over eight outputs
// however its mixer sees fit, PipeWire and ALSA likewise, and Core Audio
// refuses outright - a HAL device has no engine layer to do the reconciling
// (libs/audio/src/backend/macos/monitor.cpp's own header says why). None of
// that is what a player wants. Which speaker a rendered channel comes out of
// is the room's business, and the renderer already has the type that records
// it: iclforge::render::Routing.
//
// So this opens the stream at the DEVICE's channel count and writes each
// rendered channel to the output the patch names, with silence in the outputs
// no channel is patched to. The platform is then never asked to widen
// anything, Core Audio's exact-width requirement is met by construction
// rather than worked around, and a patch with two channels swapped comes out
// of the swapped speakers - which is what A2's exit asks for.
//
// The default patch is built from the device's speaker mask where the backend
// reports one, so a 5.1 programme lands on a 7.1 device's front, centre, LFE
// and surround outputs and leaves its rear pair silent, rather than counting
// outputs off from zero and hoping the orders agree. See speaker_routing().
//
// Everything else - the queue, the position, flush, pause - is MonitorSink's,
// forwarded unchanged. Per-output trim and delay are deliberately NOT applied
// here: they are iclforge::render::TrimDelay's, applied to the rendered channels
// before they are submitted, so one pass covers every output whatever it is
// plugged into.

// which Routing::unpatched_channels() reports and a settings page should
// say - are a slot whose speaker the device has not got, an empty slot, and
// a slot placed by angle rather than named by a speaker, which has nothing
// to match against and is the caller's own patch to make.
//
// With no mask - a backend that cannot say - the standard arrangement for the
// device's width is assumed instead (speakers.hpp's default_speakers, which
// RenderDeviceInfo::speakers names as the most a caller can assume from the
// width alone), and the same matching runs against that. Counting outputs off
// from zero would be wrong, not merely uninformed: a rendered programme's
// slots are in the coded channel order - L C R Ls Rs, with the LFE feed last -
// while a device's outputs are in WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE's, so on a 5.1 device
// the identity would send the centre to the right speaker and the LFE to a
// surround. Only a width no single arrangement fits (ten channels is 5.1.4 or
// 7.1.2, and nothing says which) falls back to the identity, there being
// nothing left to match against.
