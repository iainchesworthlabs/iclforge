// The channel mask WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE defines, and how its speaker positions
// relate to the locations the renderer places (iclforge::base::Location,
// Table E2.5).
//
// Every output backend here already speaks some version of this vocabulary:
// WASAPI carries it as dwChannelMask, ALSA answers snd_pcm_query_chmaps with
// SND_CHMAP_* positions, PipeWire lists audio.position names, and CoreAudio
// gives channel labels in an AudioChannelLayout. They name the same speakers,
// so this file is the one place that maps between them and the renderer's
// locations - a device record can then say which speaker each of its channels
// is (passthrough.hpp's RenderDeviceInfo), and a routing patch from the
// renderer's slots to the device's channels can be built from that
// (render::Routing, A1) rather than guessed from a channel count.
//
// The bit values are ksmedia.h's SPEAKER_* constants, spelled out because
// nothing in src/ includes a Windows header on another platform, and because
// the ALSA, PipeWire and CoreAudio backends need the same numbers to report a
// mask of their own.
