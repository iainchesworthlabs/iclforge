// the objects ARE: how many, where each one sits in the room, how loud, and
// which of them are nailed to speakers rather than free to move.
//
// OAMD carries no audio. The essences come out of the JOC decoder, one per
// object, and OAMD is matched to them BY POSITION (§4.3 decodes the essences
// at step 3 and the properties at step 5, and never pairs them by name) - so
// object order is a wire contract, not a presentation detail. §5.6.4.8 fixes
// it: objects contained in a bed first, then ISF objects, then dynamic ones.
//
// Two channel orderings collide here and they are not the same:
//   - a bed's own order is Table 12's, read from array index 9 downwards, so
//     5.1 is L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs;
//   - AC-3 codes 3/2 + LFE as L, C, R, Ls, Rs, LFE (Table 5.8).
// C and R swap and the LFE moves. The JOC downmix (Table 47) agrees with the
// former, so the encoder permutes once on the way in and everything object-
// facing stays in Table 12 order.
