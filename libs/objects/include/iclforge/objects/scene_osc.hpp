// The OSC 1.0 wire form of a live scene update - the third reader of a
// per-object placement, beside the JSON and keyframe-text forms in scene.hpp
// (scene_json.cpp, scene.cpp's own scene_objects_from_keyframe_text). Where
// those two AUTHOR a timeline up front, this one feeds iclforge::objects::oba::SceneCursor
// while a session is running: parse one UDP datagram from a show-control rig
// or a DAW into zero or more updates, merge each onto the object's current
// placement, push the result.
//
// Deliberately narrow, per CONTRIBUTING.md's "say so" rule for behaviour
// short of the standard - this is not a general OSC client:
//   - UDP only. No SLIP/TCP framing, no OSC 1.1's mid-stream length prefix.
//   - Address patterns match LITERALLY. No '?'/'*'/'[]'/'{}' glob matching -
//     nothing a live position source needs sends a pattern, and implementing
//     the matcher is the single largest piece of an OSC 1.0 implementation.
//   - Argument types 'f' (float32) and 'i' (int32, widened losslessly to
//     double) only. 'd'/'s'/'b'/anything else drops the message.
//   - A message with no OSC Type Tag String (OSC 1.0 permits this for
//     pre-1.0 compatibility) drops rather than guessing argument types.
// No third-party OSC library (oscpack, liblo) is linked or consulted for
// this - the ROADMAP.md JSON-not-YAML argument applies verbatim: OSC 1.0's
// binary grammar is small enough to transcribe completely from the published
// specification (opensoundcontrol.org, "OSC 1.0 Specification"), so there is
// never a need to borrow an implementation of it.
//
// Untrusted input (docs/threat-model.md): this is the project's first
// network-facing parser. It cannot crash, read out of bounds, or loop
// unboundedly on any input - see parse_osc_packet's own comment for the
// specific bounds - and is covered by fuzz/fuzz_osc_parse.cpp accordingly.
