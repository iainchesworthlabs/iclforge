// iclforge::adm::parse_bw64(std::istream&) (libs/adm/src/adm.cpp) - the BW64/RF64
// container walk plus the ADM XML document inside <axml>.
//
// The widest untrusted surface in the tree by input language: a BW64 file is
// chunk-structured binary carrying an arbitrary XML document, and both halves
// come straight from whoever produced the file. It is also the one parser
// here that is not clean-room - it delegates to the vendored libbw64 and
// libadm (see libs/adm/CMakeLists.txt) - so a report from this harness may
// land in third-party code rather than in iclforge's own; that is worth
// knowing either way, since the bytes reach it through an iclforge API.
//
// Built only with -DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON, which is off by default and
// additionally needs vcpkg's "adm" feature for libadm's Boost headers, so
// this harness is not in tools/fuzz/run.sh's default target list - see fuzz/
// README.md's "The ADM harness is opt-in".
//
// parse_bw64 spools the stream to a temporary file and reopens it by path
// (libbw64's reader has no istream constructor - see the header's own note),
// so each execution costs a file create/write/read/unlink. That is the same
// unavoidable round trip fuzz_wav_read already pays, and the reason this
// harness runs at a fraction of the others' exec/s.
