# Patch step for the vendored libbw64, run by src/adm/CMakeLists.txt's
# FetchContent_Populate(libbw64 ... PATCH_COMMAND), in libbw64's source directory,
# which `cmake -P` reports as CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR.
#
# Two patches against the pinned commit, both PRs proposed against the pinned fork
# (github.com/pwnified/libbw64) - see the CHANGELOG entry that added each for its PR link.
# Each stays until its PR lands, or until the pin moves to a commit that already carries it;
# either way, deleting this file and its PATCH_COMMAND wiring in src/adm/CMakeLists.txt is
# the whole removal once both do.
#
# 1. Bw64Reader::parseChunkHeaders() (reader.hpp) refuses ANY chunk whose resolved size runs
#    past the end of the file - "chunk ends after end of file" - with no exception for <data>. A
#    recording truncated mid-<data> is an ordinary file (a transfer cut short, a disk that filled
#    up during capture), not a malformed one, and this project's own tests
#    (tests/adm/test_adm.cpp's "a file truncated inside its data chunk still parses") require it
#    to still read as far as it goes, the way every version of libbw64 before this one did. Every
#    OTHER chunk still throws - only <data> is exempted, and only from this ONE check.
# 2. FormatInfoChunk's constructor (chunks.hpp) accepts bitsPerSample 16, 24 or 32 only,
#    regardless of formatTag - so a 64-bit WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT <fmt > is refused at open time
#    even though this fork's own decodeFloatSamples/encodeFloatSamples (utils.hpp) both handle
#    64-bit float correctly; they are simply never reached. This module's own tests
#    (tests/adm/test_adm.cpp's "parses a float64 (double-precision) fmt chunk") need this widened
#    by one value to reach them.
#
# The empty-vector undefined behaviour an earlier libbw64 pin needed patching for
# (fuzz/CMakeLists.txt's instrumented set could not build iclforge_adm_objects without it) is already
# fixed here, upstream - see docs/threat-model.md's ADM section for the history; that is not a
# third patch.
#
# Matches a token rather than a line, so a CRLF checkout (core.autocrlf on
# Windows) patches the same way. Running it again on an already-patched tree
# changes nothing; a tree matching neither form means the pin moved without
# this script being updated, and stops the configure rather than silently
# doing nothing or patching the wrong thing.
