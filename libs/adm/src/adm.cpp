// common unused-slot case) survives untouched into uid()/trackRef()/packRef(). Trimming only
// space left a real, common-case file's unused chna slots coming back as fixed-width strings

// into a std::vector sized straight from the chunk header (chunks.hpp's
// UnknownChunk does `data_.resize(size); stream.read(...)`, and the axml and
// chna chunks do the same), during readFile() itself - before any iclforge
// code gets a say. A 99-byte file whose <axml> header claims four gigabytes
// asks for four gigabytes. fuzz_adm_parse reported exactly that, twice, at
// two different chunk ids. On a real system the std::bad_alloc that usually
// follows is caught by parse_bw64_path's own try/catch below and reported as
// kCannotOpen, so this is resource exhaustion rather than memory corruption -
// but a library API handed an untrusted file should not be relying on the
// allocator as its bounds check.
//
// One rule: a chunk whose declared size runs past the end of the file is
// refused, unless it is <data>.
//
// <data> is exempt for a real reason: a recording truncated mid-<data> is an
// ordinary file, libbw64 reads it as far as it goes, and refusing it here
// would break a working case. RF64's 0xFFFFFFFF "resolve through <ds64>"
// escape (BS.2088-1 §4) lands in the same branch, since an escape IS a size
// past the end of the file.
//
// Stopping the walk there was not enough, though, and two of <ds64>'s own
// fields are read on the way past because of it:
//
//   - <data>'s 64-bit size, so the walk can step over an escaped <data> and
//     go on checking the chunks after it. Returning at <data> left those
//     unchecked, while libbw64 - which resolves the same 64-bit size through
//     reader.hpp's getChunkSize64 - stepped over <data> and allocated them.
//     fuzz_adm_parse reached a 1.7 GB <UnknownChunk> that way, behind an
//     RF64 <data> declaring 1.8 GB in its 32-bit header.
//   - <ds64>'s own tableLength, which is refused when the chunk is too short
//     to hold the table it declares. libbw64 reads that many 12-byte entries
//     with no bound of its own (parser.hpp's parseDataSize64Chunk), so a
//     28-byte <ds64> claiming 4.26 billion entries is a loop of 4.26 billion
//     reads against a stream that ended - a hang rather than an allocation,
//     and the first thing mutation found once ac3adm was instrumented.
//
// The table must also END on a chunk boundary, for a reason of the same kind:
// a trailing fragment too short to be a header is one libbw64 reads regardless,
// with the size field left holding whatever was on the stack. See the return
// at the bottom.
//
// Not covered here, deliberately: <ds64>'s table can also carry a 64-bit size for any OTHER
// chunk id, whose own 32-bit header is then perfectly plausible, and libbw64 prefers that value.
// Following it would mean reading the table's entries and not just its length, which this
// function still does not do - but the pinned libbw64 now closes this itself, one layer down: its
// own chunk-header scan resolves every chunk's size through the same table before any chunk is
// materialised, and refuses one that then runs past the real end of the file (patched to still
// allow <data> to, for the same reason this function does - see patch_libbw64.cmake). This
// function stays as an independent check ahead of that rather than being trimmed down to only
