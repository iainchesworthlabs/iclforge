// Top-level entry point for iclforge::adm::ac3adm: parses a BW64/RF64 (or plain,
// sub-4 GB RIFF/WAVE carrying the same chunks) file into an AdmDocument -
// the ADM object graph plus the <chna> join table plus the decoded PCM.
//
// Roadmap item B1 phase 1 of 3 ('s "ADM BWF reader feeding the
// JOC encoder" entry): this module knows nothing about AC-3, E-AC-3 or the
// JOC/Atmos object layer - it is a container + XML metadata reader only, the
// same "codec-blind" shape as iclforge::containers::matroska, iclforge::containers::mp4 and
// iclforge::containers::mpegts. Mapping the parsed graph onto iclforge::ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder is a
// separate, later task (phase 2); a worked end-to-end example is phase 3.
//
// Implemented on top of two vendored third-party libraries rather than a
// hand-rolled parser (see src/adm/CMakeLists.txt for how they're
// fetched): libbw64 (github.com/ebu/libbw64, Apache-2.0, header-only) for
// the container layer, and libadm (github.com/ebu/libadm, Apache-2.0) for
// the ADM XML object model. Both are maintained by the same BBC/IRT team
// that authored the underlying ITU-R Recommendations themselves. Neither
// library's own types appear in this header or model.hpp - see model.hpp's
// header comment for why (the namespace collision libadm's own `::adm::`
// would otherwise cause is the main reason).
//
// Primary sources these two libraries themselves implement, and that this
// module's own translation code (src/adm/src/adm_model.cpp) cites where
// it makes a choice beyond "trust the library"):
//   - Recommendation ITU-R BS.2088-1 (10/2019), Annex 1: the BW64 container
//     - <ds64>, <fmt>, <data>, <chna>, <axml> chunk layouts.
//   - Recommendation ITU-R BS.2076-2 (10/2019), Annex 1: the Audio
//     Definition Model XML schema (audioProgramme/audioContent/audioObject/
//     audioPackFormat/audioChannelFormat/audioBlockFormat/audioStreamFormat/
//     audioTrackFormat/audioTrackUID) and its ID/coordinate/time-format
//     conventions.

//
// One asymmetry from the read side, worth stating plainly: `document.model`'s own ID strings
// (AudioObject::id, AudioPackFormat::id, ChnaEntry::uid, ...) are used here ONLY as correlation
// keys while this function wires the object graph together (matching a *_refs entry back to the
// element it names) - they never appear literally in the written file. Real, BS.2076-2-formatted
// IDs are assigned by libadm's own ::adm::reassignIds() once the whole graph is built, and it is
// THOSE that end up in the XML and in <chna>'s own AudioId rows. A caller building the AdmModel to
// pass here is therefore free to use any unique, stable strings it likes for `id`/`uid` fields -
// "obj0", "pack3", whatever is convenient - not just the "AO_1001"-style strings parse_bw64 itself
// produces. `ChnaEntry::track_ref`/`pack_ref` are read-path-only fields for this same reason: this
// function derives the real trackRef/packRef strings itself from the resolved AudioTrackUid's own
// references, so a caller populating an AdmDocument purely to write it may leave both empty.
//
// `AudioTrackUid::has_bit_depth`/`bit_depth` are not read here either. Every audioTrackUID is
// written with bitDepth = options.bit_depth, the width <fmt > declares and <data> is stored at,
// whatever the model says: a value describing some other file (a 16-bit master the model was
// parsed from, say) would contradict the <fmt > chunk written beside it. The Dolby Atmos Master
// ADM Profile expects the two to agree - Dolby Encoding Engine refuses a master whose
// audioTrackUIDs leave bitDepth out ("Mismatched track bit depth between ADM and WAV"). sampleRate
// is still written from the model, and only where `has_sample_rate` is set.
