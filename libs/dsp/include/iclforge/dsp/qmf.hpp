// The 64-band complex QMF that TS 103 420 §7.1 puts the JOC reconstruction
// in - the filterbank this tree did not have, and whose absence made
// oba::joc::reconstruct apply §6.6.6's matrix in the MDCT domain instead.
//
// Why a decoder needs a COMPLEX filterbank here rather than reusing the
// MDCT: the MDCT is critically sampled and real, so its subbands rely on
// time-domain alias cancellation between neighbouring blocks. That
// cancellation assumes the two blocks saw the same processing. A JOC matrix
// is per-band and changes every frame, so applying it in the MDCT domain
// breaks the assumption and leaves the aliasing uncancelled - it lands in
// the output as distortion that no amount of matrix accuracy removes. A
// complex filterbank at 2x oversampling (64 complex subbands per 64 real
// input samples) has no such dependency: a per-band gain is just a gain.
//
// Structure, all of it fixed here: M = 64 subbands, hop M, prototype length
// L = 640 (10 taps per subband), fold period 2M = 128 with alternating
// sign, odd-stacked (k + 1/2) modulation. The bank runs on the AC-4 banks'
// engine (libs/dsp/src/tiered/qmf_slot.hpp: TS 103 190-1 Pseudocodes 65 and
// 66 as one 64-point transform each), with this prototype in place of QWIN
// and a rotation of each subband by the half sample the two modulations
// differ by (planning/consolidation.md decision 21).
//
// Perfect reconstruction is exact, not approximate - analysis followed by
// synthesis returns the input to floating-point precision (measured: 300 dB
// SNR, tests/dsp/test_qmf.cpp). That is a property of the prototype, which
// is designed for it rather than merely tested for it; see
// tools/generators/gen_qmf_prototype.py for the conditions and the design.
//
// The prototype is NOT Dolby's. §7.1 fixes the filterbank's shape and does
// not publish its coefficients, and this project is clean-room; what §6.6.6
// actually requires of a decoder is that the matrix be applied per subband
// in an oversampled complex domain, which any prototype of this structure
// provides.
