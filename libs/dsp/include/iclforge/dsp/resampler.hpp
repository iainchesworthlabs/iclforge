// Offline, whole-buffer sample-rate conversion for a loaded file - NOT the
// live capture drift-correction resampler (iclforge::audio::DriftResampler,
// libs/audio/include/iclforge/audio/resampler.hpp). That one runs once per
// audio-thread callback, correcting tens-of-ppm clock drift between two
// devices, so it deliberately spends nothing on kernel quality: linear
// interpolation is accurate enough at those drift magnitudes and keeps the
// hot path allocation-free. This one runs exactly once per loaded second
// source file, converting its whole native rate to the session's primary
// rate (e.g. 44.1kHz -> 48kHz) before it ever reaches the encoder - a
// completely different cost/quality tradeoff, since a one-shot offline
// conversion can and should afford a proper windowed-sinc polyphase FIR
// kernel instead of a cheap two-tap interpolation.
//
// The filter is the AC-4 sample rate converter's (libs/dsp/src/tiered/resampler.hpp,
// planning/consolidation.md decision 22): a Kaiser-windowed sinc designed for the
// ratio in lowest terms, the passband to 0.86 of the lower rate's Nyquist
// frequency, the stopband from it, 100 dB down.

namespace iclforge::dsp {

// Resamples one channel of audio from input_rate to output_rate via that
// polyphase filter, computed offline over the whole buffer at once: output
// frame m is the input at m * input_rate / output_rate, the input being
// silence before its first sample and after its last. Two integer rates make
// a rational ratio, so every phase the conversion reaches is designed exactly.
//
// input_rate == output_rate is handled as an exact identity (the input is
// copied back unchanged) rather than run through the filter - a 1:1
// "conversion" should reproduce its input exactly, not merely approximate
// it to within the filter's passband ripple.
//
// input_rate == 0 or output_rate == 0 is meaningless (there is no filter
// cutoff, and no output length, that corresponds to a zero sample rate) and
// returns an empty result rather than dividing by zero or fabricating a
// ratio - this is the only case (short of an empty `input`) that returns
// fewer than round(input.size() * output_rate / input_rate) frames.
