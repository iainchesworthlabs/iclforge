// Small, real-time-safe IIR filtering for bundle C's explicit LFE routing:
// when a caller uses the assignment table (iclforge::ac3::plan::Assignment - see
// docs/forge/gui/source-assignment.md's LFE row) to send a full-bandwidth source
// channel onto the LFE or LFE2 position by hand, that content is not a
// file's own dedicated LFE channel - the automatic routing that carries one
// of those is a separate concern and passes it through untouched, nothing
// here applies to it. A hand-assigned full-range channel is arbitrary
// content the caller has chosen to place on a speaker position that a real
// subwoofer, and the LFE channel's own +10 dB mixing headroom, both assume
// carries only deep bass. Left unfiltered it would put energy well above
// what that position is meant to carry, so the caller wiring this up
// (elsewhere - not this file, see plan.hpp/assignment.hpp) band-limits it
// first with LfeLowpass.
//
// Biquad is the reusable second-order building block (Direct Form II
// Transposed, one instance per complex-conjugate pole pair - a single real-
// coefficient biquad can only realize one such pair); LfeLowpass cascades
// two of them, tuned to different Q values, into one 4th-order Butterworth
// low-pass - the standard way to build a stable higher-order Butterworth
// filter out of second-order sections. Both are allocation-free and carry
// only their own delay-line state between calls, matching this codebase's
// other per-run, caller-driven DSP objects (e.g. iclforge::audio::
// DriftResampler, iclforge::ac3::analysis::LevelMeter): construct once per run,
// process() once per frame in frame order for the run's whole life,
// reset() only at a run boundary.
