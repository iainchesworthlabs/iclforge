// What the DAC heard, by the DAC's own clock.
//
// The I2S driver says nothing when the DMA runs dry: with auto_clear it plays
// zeros and carries on, and the gap is audible and otherwise unrecorded. So the
// queue is modelled here from the one fact the hardware guarantees - it drains
// at exactly the sample rate, whatever the CPU does.
//
// When a write returns, every byte of it has been queued, so the DMA holds what
// it held on arrival plus this block, less what drained while the write waited,
// and never more than its capacity. When the NEXT block arrives, what remains
// is that figure less the drain since - and if that is zero or negative, the
// DAC has been playing silence for the difference. That is an underrun,
// counted and timed below.
//
// It is a model, and it is out by up to one descriptor: the write returns when
// its last bytes land in a descriptor buffer, not when the queue is full to the
// byte. A few milliseconds at the default depth, which is worth knowing when
// reading min_headroom and not enough to mistake a stall for a smooth run.
//
// And it is kept per play. Between two plays the queue drains and then plays
// zeros with nothing owed to it, so restart() starts the figures again and
// exempts the play's first block as open() exempts the first after boot.
// Before it did, a play started from the control surface counted the idle
// time ahead of it as one underrun: 55 seconds of it on a DevKitC-1, reported
// against a ten-minute play with no gaps in it, and the same block pinned
// min_headroom at zero.
//
// In the component, and free of ESP-IDF like interleave.hpp and layout.hpp
// beside it, so that it runs on the host. The time is the caller's: the
// streaming example's i2s and tdm sinks pass esp_timer_get_time(), and
// libs/device/tests/test_dac_queue_model.cpp passes the clock of a simulated DMA. While
// the model read esp_timer itself it ran only on a board - QEMU has no I2S, so
// CI's shapes use the capture sink - and nothing in CI executed it.
