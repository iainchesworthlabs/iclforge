// When an image an update wrote has proved itself, and when it has had long
// enough to (planning/esp32-ota.md, "The trial").
//
// The rollback bootloader boots a newly written slot once, marked
// PENDING_VERIFY. The image then has to say it is good -
// esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback() - or any reset brings the previous
// image back. It says so once every condition the board's owner names (for a
// Hearth sink: a network address, the HTTP server, the Sendspin player) has
// held for `hold_ms` without a break, and it gives up -
// esp_ota_mark_app_invalid_rollback_and_reboot() - if that has not happened
// `deadline_ms` after the trial began, as the image booted.
//
// Times are milliseconds on a clock that need not start at zero with the
// image. esp_restart() resets the S3's system timer, and with it
// esp_timer_get_time(), but QEMU's S3 carries the count on through the
// restart, so there an image an update booted on a board that had been up
// for an hour started its trial an hour in, past its deadline. The trial
// counts from the time it was started with, and the arithmetic is modulo
// 2^32, so a clock that wraps does no harm either.
//
// Free of ESP-IDF, like firmware_image.hpp beside it: firmware.cpp calls step()
// once a second from a timer with esp_timer's milliseconds and whether the
// owner's conditions hold, and does what it answers.
// libs/device/tests/test_firmware_trial.cpp runs the rules on a laptop.
