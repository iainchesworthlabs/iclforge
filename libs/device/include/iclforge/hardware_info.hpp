// What this board is, in the user's own words: GET /hardware (control.hpp)
// reports it, so that a firmware misbehaving in the field says why from its
// own web page rather than needing a debugger and this project's memory of
// which chip does what - "I detect myself as an ESP32-P4, revision 1.3, no
// PSRAM fitted" is the whole point, not a guess from the model number alone.
//
// Free of ESP-IDF, like sink_plan.hpp beside it and for the same reason: the
// facts are a target's own, gathered once by control.cpp (already ESP-IDF-only)
// from esp_chip_info(), esp_psram and CONFIG_SOC_CPU_HAS_FPU; everything below
// is turning them into fixed English sentences, which is exactly the part
// worth being able to get wrong on a laptop rather than only on a board -
// libs/ac3/tests/io/test_hardware_info.cpp exercises every chip this component has
// ever built for from synthetic facts, no board involved. Nothing here reads
// a Kconfig symbol or an ESP-IDF header by name, the same discipline
// sink_plan.hpp's own header comment explains for I2S_LL_SLOT_FRAME_BIT_MAX.

// agree - a firmware for one target refuses to boot on the wrong die - but
// they are gathered by two independent paths (one a compile-time string, the
// other a runtime register read), so describe_hardware checks them against
// each other rather than assuming a match: the one case this catches, a
// generic image flashed to the wrong board in a fleet, is exactly the kind of
