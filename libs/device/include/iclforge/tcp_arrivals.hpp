// When the bytes of a TCP stream reached the board, for a reader that gets to
// them later.
//
// A Sendspin player dates a clock reply by when it reads it
// (iclforge::sendspin::ClockSync). Its server task reads the socket, and on a part
// with one core that task waits behind the decode: on an ESP32-C6 on
// 2026-09-17 every reply of a burst was read tens of milliseconds after it
// came while a stream played, and the clock left out all of them. lwIP's IPv4
// input hook sees each segment as the network task takes it, well above the
// decode. src/tcp_arrivals.cpp keeps an ArrivalLog for each stream to the
// watched port from that hook, and the reader, counting the bytes it has
// read, asks when the last byte of a message came.
//
// ArrivalLog is free of ESP-IDF, so libs/device/tests/test_tcp_arrivals.cpp builds it
// on the host. The functions after it are the board's.
//
// Offsets count a stream's bytes from its first, as its reader counts them.
// The log grows only where the stream's bytes are contiguous: a segment past
// a gap cannot be read until the gap fills, so its bytes are dated by the
// segment that fills it. When the log has dropped entries, or missed
// segments, bytes are dated by a later entry or not at all. No error makes a
// date earlier than the bytes came, so a clock sample it dates can only look
// slower than it was, which the clock's filter is built to leave out.
