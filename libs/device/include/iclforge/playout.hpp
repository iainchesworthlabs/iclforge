// --- The DMA ring's clock ------------------------------------------------------
//
// ESP-IDF v6.1's I2S TX channel transmits a ring of `descriptors` DMA buffers,
// one after another, whether or not anything was written to them: a buffer
// nobody wrote plays as zeros when the channel clears buffers after sending
// them, as the example's does. Each buffer that finishes raises an
// end-of-frame interrupt and joins a queue of buffers free to write, which
// holds descriptors - 1 of them and drops its oldest when full;
// i2s_channel_write takes the oldest, and waits for one when the queue is
// empty. So a buffer that joined the queue at the k-th end-of-frame plays
// again when the ring comes round to it: from the (k + descriptors - 1)-th
// end-of-frame to the next, and every end-of-frame fires one buffer's length
// after the one before, by the part's own clock
// (components/esp_driver_i2s/i2s_common.c, i2s_dma_tx_callback and
// i2s_channel_write).
//
// DmaRing is the interrupt's side: the channel's on_sent callback records each
// end-of-frame. DmaClock is the writer's: after each write of whole buffers it
// works out which end-of-frames' buffers the driver took, and from a line
// fitted through the end-of-frame times, when they play.
