// Which mode (standard I2S or TDM) and how many slots each of up to two I2S
// lines needs to carry a given channel count - the arithmetic behind the
// ESP32-S3 streaming example's sink reconfiguring itself when PUT /layout
// asks for a different width, instead of a Kconfig-fixed slot count picked
// at build time.
//
// Free of ESP-IDF, like layout.hpp and render.hpp beside it and for the same
// reason: this is the part with real logic (and a hardware ceiling to get
// right), the peripheral setup around it is not, and libs/ac3/tests/io/test_sink_plan.cpp
// builds this on the host.
//
// Standard I2S is always exactly two slots (or one, a mono layout doubled
// onto both); anything wider is TDM, and a TDM line carries at most
// I2S_LL_SLOT_FRAME_BIT_MAX bits a frame - 128 on the ESP32-S3 and the
// ESP32-C6, 512 on the ESP32-P4, which ESP-IDF v6.1's i2s_tdm.c holds a slot
// configuration to. That constant is the `frame_bit_max` every function below
// takes: this header stays free of any target's own value, the same way it
// stays free of ESP-IDF itself, and a caller that already includes
// hal/i2s_ll.h for its own reasons (the streaming example's sink does, for
// I2S_LL_INST_NUM) passes I2S_LL_SLOT_FRAME_BIT_MAX straight through. At 128
// bits that is 4 slots at 32 bits (iclforge::interleave_24in32) or 8 at 16
// (iclforge::interleave_16in16); at 512 it is 16 or 32.
//
// One line: standard mode for 1-2 channels, sized to them. TDM from 3, and a
// TDM line always runs at its full ceiling width - with the slots past the
// layout's channels zeroed by the interleave. Two reasons. A TDM DAC or DSP
// is set up for a fixed frame (TDM4, TDM8), whatever the programme carries.
// And the driver's clock does not reach every shape: on an ESP32-C6 on
// 2026-09-15, ESP-IDF v6.1 accepted three- and five-slot frames at 16 and 24
// bits and clocked them 6.7% fast (a second of frames drained in 937 ms),
// where the other accepted 16-bit and 24-bit shapes and two to four 32-bit
// slots drained in 999. The driver's i2s_tdm_calculate_clock divides MCLK by
// BCLK in integers and only warns when that does not divide: three 16-bit
// slots under the default 256x MCLK need 5.33 and get 5, a 51,200 Hz frame.
//
// A fixed frame (SinkFrame::fixed): TDM at the full width for every channel
// count from one, for a TDM DAC set up for one frame shape. An ESS ES9080 is
// the case in hand: its slot count, slot width and channel map are written
// over I2C once, and its PLL can lock to the bit clock, so a 2.0 play opened
// as standard I2S would change the bit clock under it and put the samples in
// slots it does not read. A mono layout in a fixed frame rides slot 0 alone
// with the rest zeroed, as in any TDM frame; a DAC that should play it on two
// outputs maps both to that slot. SinkFrame::follow_layout, standard I2S for
// one or two channels, is what a stereo I2S DAC such as a PCM5102 needs.
//
// Two lines only come into it once channels exceeds one line's ceiling: they
// share one bit clock and word select (see the streaming example's
// sink/i2s/audio_sink.cpp for why - line 1 is a slave taking its clock from
// line 0's output pins), so both must present the SAME frame shape for a
// shared word-select transition to mean the same thing to each - the full
// width again, real channels filling from line 0 first and whatever is left
// over riding in line 1 with its remaining slots zeroed. In a fixed frame a
// usable second line runs for every layout, all of its slots zeroed while
// line 0 holds the whole layout: a second DAC on line 1's data pin keeps its
// PLL locked to the shared bit clock whatever plays, and a data pin nobody
// drives gives it no defined samples.
