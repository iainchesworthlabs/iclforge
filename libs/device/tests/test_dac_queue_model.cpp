// The streaming example's model of its DAC's DMA queue, on the host.
//
// The model (iclforge/dac_queue_model.hpp) lives in the ESP-IDF component and
// includes nothing from ESP-IDF - the arrangement test_interleave.cpp and
// test_layout.cpp have. The i2s and tdm sinks give it esp_timer_get_time();
// this gives it the clock of the DMA below, which is what the model assumes of
// the real one: a fixed capacity, drained at exactly the byte rate whatever
// the writer does, and a write that returns once the whole block is in the
// queue, as i2s_channel_write with portMAX_DELAY does.
//
// The model cannot run under QEMU, which has no I2S, and on a board it sees
// only what the board happens to do. Three defects were found in it on
// 2026-09-10, each with a harness of this kind: the idle gap between two plays
// counted as one underrun; drain arithmetic in bytes that overflowed after
// about five weeks idle at sixteen slots; and a first fix for that which
// rounded the queue's figure down twice a block until it fell behind the
// DMA's for good. They are the first, fifth and last cases below.
