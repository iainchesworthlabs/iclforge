# The ESP32 player's stream set

!!! note "Status as of 2026-09-30: built and in use; all eight decisions taken as recommended"
    Streams for the player's `http` source, in one directory a device can be pointed at: 7.1.4
    streams that decode to all twelve slots of a 7.1.4 output, and beside them a range across the
    layouts the player renders onto, both codecs, dependent substreams, two programmes, dual
    mono, the Annex E coding tools, short frames, VBR, DRC metadata, other encoders' streams and
    object audio. A manifest says what each stream is and the level each slot of a 7.1.4 output
    should get from it. CI plays the set under QEMU onto 7.1.4 and holds every slot to its level.

    The set is 38 streams and `streams.json` in
    `esp-idf/iclforge/examples/hearth_sink/www/`, and the table under [The set](#the-set) matches
    that manifest. It holds AC-3 and E-AC-3 streams and no AC-4: the P4's AC-4 plays used Dolby
    Encoding Engine streams served from a desktop
    ([ESP32-P4 → AC-4](../docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-p4.md#ac-4)).

    Since Hearth B3 (2026-09-16) servers play to a board over Sendspin; the `http` source this
    set is served to remains for `POST /play`, for the checks in CI and for board measurements,
    the P4's among them
    ([ESP32-P4 → Stream set](../docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-p4.md#stream-set)). Two things
    the set found are still open: a stream using transient pre-noise processing ends one access
    unit short, and `714-ecpl` and `714-tpn` need PSRAM ([What the set
    found](#what-the-set-found), [Measured again on 2026-09-16](#measured-again-on-2026-09-16)).

    Playing the set found four things in the player ([What the set found](#what-the-set-found)):
    a stream carrying two programmes had both played, a frame of each, and now plays its first;
    a stream at 44.1 or 32 kHz played at the wrong speed, and is now refused; a stream using
    transient pre-noise processing loses its last access unit; and folding a stream with a
    four-channel dependent substream to 2.0 did not fit a network shape's internal RAM without
    PSRAM until the output stage began folding 256 samples at a time on 2026-09-11. Both of the
    last two are the decoder core's, handed over in the player plan.

    On a board with PSRAM ([On a board](#on-a-board)) every stream in the set played with the
    host's levels, and the wide folds fit. What the board found is time: over WiFi a 7.1.4
    stream folded to 2.0 took longer to decode than it lasts, until that change brought it to
    real time, and a 7.1.4 stream using AHT or enhanced coupling still does.

    Measured again on 2026-09-16 ([Measured again on
    2026-09-16](#measured-again-on-2026-09-16)): what kept the streams marked "no" out of CI's
    shape was the total internal RAM they need, not how the heap was cut up. The Dolby Encoding
    Engine's 5.1 has fitted since the decoder split its AHT buffer per stream, and 7.1.4 with AHT
    fits since the decoder stopped keeping that buffer at all; CI plays all three. 7.1.4 with
    TPN still needs PSRAM, the shape short of about 51 KB for it. 7.1.4 with enhanced coupling
    now plays in the shape too, but with a few KB to spare where the streams CI plays keep
    30 KB, so it stays marked.

    Written beside [the web UI's output layout](esp32-device-ui.md#the-output-layout), which
    uses these streams to show what a layout does, and in the shape of [the player
    plan](esp32-player.md): what exists, what changes and why, what was measured, what cannot be
    verified, and [Decisions](#decisions) with a recommendation and a cost each.

## Why

The player's `http` source has been given one stream, in CI and on the board: the WASM page's
demo, E-AC-3 5.1 with objects, played onto two slots every time. What reaches a 7.1.4 output
from a 7.1.4 stream over the network had not been played; nor a 5.1 stream on 7.1.4, which shows
the heights left silent; nor most of Annex E through the player rather than through the
footprint probe. The page's report of a layout (the web UI's design) needs streams whose
reports differ, and a test on a board needs something to point a device at.

## What was in the tree

| Streams | Where | What they carry, checked with `ac3cli probe` |
|---|---|---|
| The WASM page's demo | `apps/demos/wasm/assets/demo.ec3` | E-AC-3 5.1, JOC objects in the QMF domain, 8 s. What CI's HTTP step serves. |
| The example's own | `esp-idf/iclforge/examples/hearth_sink/stream/` | `sample.ac3` (AC-3 5.1, six frames), flashed to a partition; `height.ec3` (the probe's height fixture: five objects over a 5.1 bed, three on the ceiling, MDCT-band domain, six access units), which `sdkconfig.ci-render` plays from FAT onto 7.1.4 |
| The fuzz seeds | `libs/ac3/fuzz/seeds/fuzz_eac3_decode/` | One-second streams from `tools/fuzz/generate-seeds.sh`: a tone per speaker at every layout the encoder names, the Annex E tool combinations at 5.1 and 7.1.4, objects, two external streams |
| The external baseline | `tests/golden/external-baseline/` | Dolby Encoding Engine and FFmpeg streams: AC-3 and E-AC-3, stereo and 5.1, music and speech |
| A licensed encoder's objects | `tests/golden/object-fixture/dee_joc_514.ec3` | 5.1.4 carried as JOC objects, QMF domain |

Two things the checking found. The seeds named `eac3-encode-*-714` are encoded from a 5.1
source, so four of their twelve channels - three heights and the LFE - are silent: they serve
the fuzzers and are not used here. And the seeds with a tone per speaker code a dependent
substream's four channels at a rate low enough to move those channels' levels by up to 15%;
the levels below are what the decoder makes of them, so a check is not affected, and the new
7.1.4 streams are coded at a rate that leaves every speaker at its level.

## The set

`esp-idf/iclforge/examples/hearth_sink/www/`, served as it is. **No PSRAM** is whether CI's
twelve-slot network shape, which has none, plays the stream to its end; see [What the network
shape holds at 7.1.4](#what-the-network-shape-holds-at-714).

Every stream but `ac3-51-44k.ac3` is at 48 kHz; that one is in the set to be refused.

## How the streams are made

`tools/generators/gen_device_streams.py --ac3cli <a host ac3cli>` writes the directory and its
manifest, `streams.json`. It synthesises these signals and encodes them with this repository's
encoder:

- a tone per speaker, a third of an octave apart (L 250 Hz up to Rts 2,500 Hz, the LFE at
  63 Hz), all at once: `714-tones.ec3`;
- the same tones one speaker at a time, 0.4 s each, in slot order: `714-walk.ec3`, the one to
  listen to on a 7.1.4 room;
- for the coding tools, each speaker's tone with a second tone above where coupling and spectral
  extension start, a little noise across the band, and a click every quarter second so that
  block switching has transients to switch on: the `714-*` and `51-*` streams and the AC-3 ones;
- two mono tones, for dual mono and the second programme;
- the 5.1 tones at 44.1 kHz, for the stream the player refuses.

The objects stream is `ac3cli atmos` - four objects orbiting at different heights - with
`joc-domain=mdct`. The rest are copies of the streams in the table above, left as they are.

For each stream, `streams.json` has what `ac3cli probe` reports - codec, coded channels by
location, substreams, programmes, objects, blocks per syncframe, the coding tools the stream
uses, bit rate, length - and two things a play is checked against: the access units a player of
its first programme decodes, and `levels_714`, what each slot of a 7.1.4 output should get, as
RMS x 1e6, the form the player prints. The levels are the host decoder's: the stream decoded as
coded (no dialnorm normalisation and no DRC, the player's `CONFIG_AC3FORGE_EXAMPLE_DRC_MODE=2`),
objects decoded bed-only, and each channel's level placed on the slot of its own location. A 0
is a slot that nothing in the stream is at, and the player must leave it at exactly 0.

The 24 streams made are 1.2 MB; the directory is 2.7 MB with the fourteen copies, which cost the
repository nothing, since git keeps one copy of identical content whatever its path.

## Where the set lives, and how it is served

Beside the example that plays it. Any static HTTP server will do:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0 --directory esp-idf/iclforge/examples/hearth_sink/www
```

and a device plays `http://<host>:8000/714-walk.ec3` - `10.0.2.2` from QEMU's user-mode network,
the serving machine's LAN address from a board. The packing script leaves the directory out of
the component's registry archive; it is the repository's, not the component's.

## What CI plays

A new shape, `sdkconfig.ci-http714`: `sdkconfig.ci-http`'s source, network and control surface,
with the capture sink's twelve-slot TDM conversion, the layout `7.1.4`, levels as coded
(`CONFIG_AC3FORGE_EXAMPLE_DRC_MODE=2`) and objects played as their bed
(`CONFIG_AC3FORGE_EXAMPLE_OBJECTS=1`, [decision 4](#decisions)), booting on `714-walk.ec3`. A
step in the ESP32 job, "Play the stream set onto 7.1.4 over QEMU's Ethernet", after "Drive the
web page on the emulated board":

1. builds the shape, serves the set on port 8000 and boots it under QEMU with the control
   surface forwarded, as the HTTP step does;
2. plays every stream not marked PSRAM-only through `POST /play`, one at a time, and
   `tools/checks/check_stream_set.py` holds each play to the manifest: `result=pass`, no bytes
   skipped for sync, the stream's access units (played and held together, see below), and every
   slot's level within 1% + 20 of the host's, a slot at 0 at exactly 0 - and, from
   `GET /status`, the play's `stream.layout`, `render`, `coded` and `silent` against what the
   manifest's levels imply;
3. drives the web page on this twelve-slot board (`device-ui/board/layouts.spec.js`): the Output,
   Silent and Next play rows through a 5.1 stream on 7.1.4, a 7.1.4 stream on 5.1, a 5.1 stream
   folded to 2.0, a layout wider than the bus, and the 44.1 kHz stream refused;
4. checks the console for a panic, a second boot or a failed allocation, and holds the lowest
   free-heap figure the play printed to `--min-heap-free`
   (`tools/checks/check_esp_console.py`).

The tolerance is tighter than the 5% + 200 the other ESP32 steps allow, on the evidence of the
measurement below: over 34 plays the largest difference between a slot's level on the emulated
target (float32) and the host's (float64) was one unit of RMS x 1e6. One percent still catches
every fault a level can show - a channel in the wrong slot, a silent one, a doubled programme,
a fold where there should be none - with a hundredfold margin over the arithmetic.

Cost: one more build of the example in the ESP32 job, a few minutes on the fleet's runners, and
about two minutes of plays and page. `tools/checks/test_check_stream_set.py` tests the
checker's parsing and rules on the host, in the Oracle unit tests step.

## What the network shape holds at 7.1.4

Measured under QEMU on 2026-09-11 in the shape above, with objects played as their bed except
where the row says otherwise: 288 KB of internal heap free as each play started, the largest
block 200 KB, no PSRAM.

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| Every channel-based layout to 7.1.4, AC-3, no tools, coupling, spectral extension, AHT, enhanced coupling and TPN at 5.1, short frames, VBR, DRC words, dual mono, FFmpeg's stream, the Dolby Encoding Engine's AC-3 and its stereo music | Played to the end. Every slot's level the host's to within one unit of RMS x 1e6; every slot the manifest has at 0 exactly 0. The decode task's stack had 7.9 to 9.1 KB of its 24 KB left. |
| Objects as their bed: `demo.ec3`, `objects-mdct.ec3`, `height.ec3`, `514-joc-dee.ec3` | Played; the bed's levels the host's |
| Objects reconstructed and placed (the default policy) | `abort()` for `height.ec3`, the orbiting-objects fuzz seed and `514-joc-dee.ec3`: a request of 6,144 to 22,528 bytes failed with no free block that large. `demo.ec3` placed its objects and left 1,872 bytes of the 24 KB decode stack. |
| AHT at 7.1.4 (`714-aht`, `714-all`) | `abort()`: 43,008 bytes asked for, 24,316 free, largest block 13,312. That is the decoder's per-frame AHT buffer for one substream: 256 bins, six blocks, seven channels, four bytes. |
| The Dolby Encoding Engine's 5.1 (`dee-eac3-51`: coupling, spectral extension and AHT) | `abort()`: the same 43,008 bytes, with 86,036 free but no block larger than 39,936. The 5.1 AHT stream this set makes, with no coupling channel, asks for 36,864 and plays. |
| Enhanced coupling and TPN at 7.1.4 | `abort()`: 6,144 bytes, 8,212 and 8,140 free, largest blocks 4,480 and 1,792 |

**At 2.0 the fold is what does not fit.** In the two-slot HTTP shape, the same streams played
to `2.0`: 5.1 and 5.1.2 fold, and 7.1, 5.1.4 and 7.1.4 abort - `OutputStage::apply`, the
fold's scratch, asks for 6,144 bytes with 7,564 to 8,844 free and no block larger than 5,632.
The twelve-slot shape does the same for 7.1.4 at `2.0` (3,212 free). Played as coded onto twelve
slots those streams leave 147 KB free, so it is folding a programme with a four-channel
dependent substream that costs the memory. The page's twelve-slot test folds a 5.1 stream for
that reason. Since 2026-09-11 the output stage folds 256 samples at a time, and its largest
allocation is 1,024 bytes where it was 6,144 ([Folded to stereo](../docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md#folded-to-stereo)).
Run again on 2026-09-12, the two-slot shape folded 7.1, 5.1.4 and 7.1.4 to `2.0` and the
twelve-slot shape 7.1 and 7.1.4, and one play still aborted: the fuzz seed's 7.1.4, fifth after
boot in the two-slot shape, on the decoder's own frame-long channel buffers
(`Eac3Decoder::decode_substream_core`), 6,144 bytes with 17,088 free and no block over 5,632.

The allocations that failed are the decoder's, which are the same whatever the output layout:
the player's block storage was sixteen slots at every layout (it is sized from the layout
now), and the capture sink converts one block at a time. A board with PSRAM puts allocations of 16 KB and over there
(`sdkconfig.psram`), which is where the streams marked "no" are meant to play. Each 1-second
play took about two seconds of wall clock under QEMU.

### Measured again on 2026-09-16

By then the decoder allocated its per-substream slots only for the substreams a stream carries,
and kept its AHT buffer per stream rather than as one 43,008-byte block. The Dolby Encoding
Engine's 5.1 played in this shape, its least free internal heap during the play 53,324 bytes.
The four 7.1.4 streams marked "no" still aborted, each with a little more internal heap free
than it asked for. That read as fragmentation, and the first idea was to allocate the decoder's
frame-long buffers before the network stack's.

Summing every internal region at each abort says otherwise. A local build printed
`heap_caps_print_heap_info` from the failed-allocation hook:

| Stream | Asked for | Free in all internal regions | Of which in the largest region |
|---|---|---|---|
| `714-ecpl` | 2,508 (`substreams.reserve(3)`) | 2,920 | 852, in 23 pieces |
| `714-aht` | 6,144 (a substream's overlap-add history) | 6,392 | 3,456 |
| `714-tpn` | 6,144 (a PCM channel) | 8,776, after a low of 3,772 | 5,840 |
| `714-all` | 6,144 | 6,756 | 3,820 |

Each still had more to allocate. Two measurements put a size on it:

- the true least free internal heap of each play that fits, read with
  `heap_caps_monitor_local_minimum_free_size_start()` at the start of the play. The `heap_free=`
  figure in the progress lines, which `--min-heap-free` holds, is a sample and reads higher: a
  7.1.4 stream's true low is 30 to 35 KB;
- each play's demand, from a build of the same shape with QEMU's PSRAM (quad, 32 MB) and
  `CONFIG_SPIRAM_MALLOC_ALWAYSINTERNAL=0`, where everything `malloc` hands out comes from PSRAM
  and every stream plays: the PSRAM free as the play starts, less the least it reaches.

For the plays that fit, demand and true low add up to between 244.5 and 246.5 KB every time.
That is the room this shape has for them, however the heap is cut up:

| Stream | Demand, before the changes below | Against the room |
|---|---|---|
| `714-none`, `714-cpl`, `714-spx` | 212,940 to 213,204 | plays; true low 31,592 to 33,324 |
| `714-ecpl` | 246,632 | short by up to 2 KB |
| `714-aht` | 251,128 | short by 5 to 7 KB |
| `714-all` | 255,380 | short by 9 to 11 KB |
| `714-tpn` | 297,380 | short by about 51 KB |
| `dee-eac3-51` | 193,132 | plays |

No order of allocation makes up a shortfall in the total. At 5.1, over a stream with spectral
extension, AHT costs 40 KB, enhanced coupling 35 KB and TPN 30 KB.

**AHT.** The AHT buffers were a copy. An AHT stream's six blocks were decoded into a buffer per
stream, 6,144 bytes each, and each block then copied its own out into the per-block coefficient
store the decoder keeps for every stream anyway. The decoder now decodes them straight into that
store, bit for bit the same in all three arithmetic tiers. `714-aht` and `714-all` then play in
this shape, their true lows 31,224 to 32,040 and 30,072 to 32,196 bytes over four runs each,
and `dee-eac3-51`'s rises to about 95 KB. CI plays all three.

**Enhanced coupling** was short by up to 2 KB, and most of its 33 KB over coupling is still one
23,552-byte allocation: the spectrum scratch's eight 512-sample arrays, and 7,168 bytes of tables
narrowed from the double ones when the scratch is built. Two smaller things went the same day.
The reconstruction had read its neighbouring blocks' coupling channel from a 6,144-byte copy,
and now reads the per-block store. And an access unit's substreams, 2,508 bytes for three, were
gathered in an array allocated and freed around every unit; the decoder now keeps that array.
The second is where fragmentation did matter. With the player's block storage sized to the
layout (4 KB back at 7.1.4), `714-ecpl` got past its first unit and then failed that 2,508-byte
request on a later one, with 9,056 bytes free and no block over 1,632.

With both changes, `714-ecpl` plays in this shape, and its levels are the host's. But its true
low is 2,236 bytes with the player as it is, and 7,496 to 7,700 over three runs with the block
storage sized to the layout. In one of those three runs the lap line's sampled `heap_free`,
15,980, fell under the step's 24,576 floor. The 7.1.4 streams CI plays keep 30 to 35 KB, so
`714-ecpl` stays marked until the spectrum scratch shrinks. (The floor is 20,480 bytes now: when
Hearth B2 put mDNS on the board, which costs about 8 KB of internal RAM in every shape, the step
moved it, as its comment in `_build.yml` records.)

**TPN** is short by about 51 KB. Holding a frame back for §3.7 keeps a second full set of PCM for
every substream - 86 KB for a 7.1.4 stream's fourteen coded channels - and each substream using
the tool allocates a 12,288-byte splice buffer in every frame. That needs a different design,
not a smaller buffer.

## What the set found

**A stream with two programmes had both played, a frame of each.** `eac3-programmes.ec3` carries
a 5.1 programme and a mono one as two independent substreams. The player handed every access unit
to the decoder, whose `DecoderConfig::programme` it leaves unset, and the decoder renders
whichever programme a unit belongs to: the play decoded 64 access units and reported 2,048 ms of
audio for a 1,024 ms programme, with the mono programme's tone in the centre slot and every other
slot at 0.71 of the host's level. `result=pass` does not show it; the levels do. `ac3cli`
decodes the first programme a stream carries, and so should the player ([decision
5](#decisions)).

**A stream using transient pre-noise processing loses its last access unit.** §3.7's tool holds
each frame back one call, and at the end of the stream the last one is still held: `51-tpn.ec3`
played 15 of its 16 access units, with `stream.held=1` and 480 ms of its 512. `Eac3Decoder::flush()`
releases it, but as raw per-substream results rather than through the block form the player uses,
and adding a flush to the block form is the decoder core's to do. So the set's checker counts a
play's units played and held together, and the player plan records the hand-over.

**Nothing checked a stream's sample rate against the sink's.** The example opens its sink at
48 kHz once, and no part of the player compared a stream's rate with it, so a 44.1 kHz AC-3
stream played 9% fast and its pitch a semitone and a half high. The player now refuses one
([decision 6](#decisions)), and `ac3-51-44k.ac3` is in the set as the stream it refuses.

**Folding a wide programme to 2.0 did not fit without PSRAM**, as [the network shape's
figures](#what-the-network-shape-holds-at-714) show: 7.1, 5.1.4 and 7.1.4 aborted in the fold's
scratch. A board with PSRAM folded them ([On a board](#on-a-board)), but not 7.1.4 in real
time. Both were the decoder core's to change ([decision 8](#decisions)). Since 2026-09-11 the
output stage folds a block at a time: its scratch fits a shape without PSRAM, and on the board
7.1.4 at 2.0 decodes at 1.00x real time, 18 of 900 blocks still reaching an empty queue. The
player plan records what is left.

**Dual mono reported no channels.** `stream.channels` for E-AC-3 1+1 was the decoder's layout
count, which is 0 because 1+1 has no Table E2.5 layout; the player now reports 2.

## On a board

Played on 2026-09-11 on the second ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 (N16R8, 240 MHz, no DAC wired: the I2S
peripheral clocks out whether or not anything listens, so its pacing and its counters are real),
from this directory served over the LAN, in the board's network shape
(`sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.hw;sdkconfig.psram` with the source, its URL and the network's
credentials). Two images of this branch:

- **2.0 on the I2S sink**, the shape the board already ran: fifteen streams, 5.1 to 7.1.4, the
  Annex E tools at 5.1, AC-3, dual mono, two programmes and the 44.1 kHz stream.
- **7.1.4 on the null sink**, levels as coded and objects as their bed, as CI's shape has them:
  every stream in the set, one `POST /play` at a time. The null sink paces nothing, so a frame's
  time is the decode and the render.

**Every stream played, and the levels are the host's.** At 2.0 each fold's two levels are the
host's `ac3cli decode ... downmix=loro drcmode=line` to the digit, the four wide streams
included. At 7.1.4, 34 of 38 plays have every slot the host's to the digit, two are one unit
out, and the two TPN streams differ by the access unit the block form holds back. The five
streams marked "no" played at 7.1.4 with the rest. Each play started with 169 KB of internal RAM
free, the largest block 90 to 94 KB, and 8.3 MB of PSRAM; nothing failed to allocate, and the
board did not restart. `GET /status` reported each play as the page shows it: `loro` at 2.0,
`channels` at 7.1.4, the coded channels by location, and the speakers left silent - ten of
twelve for the Dolby Encoding Engine's stereo music at 7.1.4.

**The folds fit; the time does not.** Per 32 ms frame, where allocations of 16 KB and over are
in PSRAM:

| Stream | 2.0: decode with the fold | Blocks to an empty queue at 2.0 | 7.1.4: decode | 7.1.4: render |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `layout-51` (5.1) | 13.8 ms | 0 of 192 | 9.3 ms | 1.4 ms |
| `layout-512` (5.1.2) | 20.6 ms | 0 of 192 | 14.5 ms | 1.5 ms |
| `layout-71` (7.1) | 23.5 ms | 4 of 192 | 16.2 ms | 1.5 ms |
| `layout-514` (5.1.4) | 23.7 ms | 3 of 192 | 16.1 ms | 1.7 ms |
| `714-walk` (7.1.4) | 36.0 ms | 149 of 900 | 27.4 ms | 2.2 ms |
| `714-tones` (7.1.4) | 35.6 ms | 62 of 378 | 27.1 ms | 2.2 ms |

At 2.0 the decode includes the decoder's output stage - the fold, with the example's line-mode
DRC and dialnorm - which the 7.1.4 image, playing levels as coded, does not run. The two images'
decode differs by 4.5 ms of the frame for 5.1 and 8.6 ms for 7.1.4, where the renderer places
the same channels on twelve slots in 1.4 to 2.2 ms. The difference is the fold: on these
streams, which carry no dynrng words and a dialnorm of -31, line-mode DRC and dialnorm do no
per-sample work. Most of the fold's cost was two copies through the mask ROM's `memmove`, loops
compiled at `-Os`, and frame-long buffers ([Folded to
stereo](../docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md#folded-to-stereo)). So a 7.1.4 stream at 2.0 fell behind:
`714-walk` put 149 of its 900 blocks into an empty queue, 940 ms of silence in 4.8 s. Behind, the
decode task never waits on the sink, so core 1's idle task missed the five-second task
watchdog, which printed a backtrace in `Eac3Decoder::decode_substream_core` and let the play go
on (`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_PANIC` is off). 7.1 and 5.1.4 kept up, a few blocks short at the start
of a one-second play. Since 2026-09-11 the output stage folds 256 samples at a time: built
before and after that change and played on one board, `714-walk` at 2.0 went from 35.3 to 30.0
ms of decode a frame, 1.00x real time, and from 149 to 18 of 900 blocks to an empty queue, with
the watchdog quiet and the levels unchanged. What is left at 2.0 is the 7.1.4 decode itself.

Onto twelve slots a 7.1.4 stream with no coding tools decodes and renders in 26.7 to 29.6 ms,
inside the frame before any sink converts a sample. The coding tools take it to the edge of the
frame and past it:

| 7.1.4 with | Decode and render | Of the frame |
|---|---|---|
| no tools (`714-none`) | 26.7 ms | 0.83 |
| TPN | 30.4 ms | 0.95 |
| coupling | 30.7 ms | 0.96 |
| spectral extension | 31.1 ms | 0.97 |
| AHT | 35.2 ms | 1.10 |
| all of them | 39.1 ms | 1.22 |
| enhanced coupling | 59.2 ms | 1.85 |

A 7.1.4 output also needs a way out of the part for twelve channels, and one TDM line is not
it: the S3's I2S carries at most 128 bits a frame - four 32-bit slots or eight 16-bit ones on a
data line - and ESP-IDF v6.1 refuses a larger slot configuration when the channel is set up
(`i2s_tdm_set_slot`). The example's twelve-slot shapes use the `capture` sink's conversion,
which has no peripheral behind it. So these figures are the decode and the render; how twelve
channels leave an S3, and what that costs in time and internal RAM, is still open.

## What cannot be verified

- **Object placement over the network.** CI's shape and the board's 7.1.4 image play objects
  as their bed; `sdkconfig.ci-render` places objects from FAT. Under QEMU `demo.ec3` placed its
  objects with 1,872 bytes of the 24 KB decode stack left; a board's network shape gives the
  task 32 KB, and has not placed objects over the network.
- **7.1.4 out of the part.** One TDM line on the S3 carries at most four 32-bit or eight 16-bit
  slots, so no sink here sends twelve channels to a DAC; QEMU has no I2S, and the board has no
  DAC. The board's figures are the decode and the render. Since 2026-09-12 the `i2s` sink can
  take a second line for sixteen 16-bit slots (PR #666), and it has not run into DACs either. The
  P4's one controller holds a 512-bit frame, but the chip revision on the P4 board cannot open
  TDM above two channels ([the sink tiers plan](esp32-sink-tiers.md)).
- **The streams marked "no", in CI** - `714-ecpl` and `714-tpn` since 2026-09-16. They played
  on the board on 2026-09-11, and CI's shape has no PSRAM, so a change that breaks them shows
  only on a board.

## Decisions

Status, 2026-09-30: all eight were taken as (a), as recommended, and are built. The set lives in
`www/` (1) and `gen_device_streams.py` makes it (2). `check_stream_set.py` holds a play to the
host's levels (3), and CI's shape plays objects as their bed (4). The player plays a stream's
first programme (5) and refuses a stream at another sample rate (6). The manifest marks the
PSRAM-only streams, two of them since 2026-09-16 (7). The fold at 2.0 was handed to the decoder
core and changed there (8).

1. **Where the set lives.** (a) **`www/` beside the example, left out of the registry archive**;
   (b) `apps/demos/wasm/assets/`, which CI's HTTP step already serves; (c) served from where the streams
   are now. **Recommend (a).** (b) puts some forty device fixtures in the WASM page's asset
   directory, beside the one file that page loads. (c) ties the device's checks to fuzz seeds that
   `tools/fuzz/generate-seeds.sh` rewrites and to fixtures kept for other checks. Cost: 1.2 MB of new
   files in the repository, and an entry in `pack_esp_component.py`.

2. **How the streams are made.** (a) **a generator in `tools/generators`, its output committed**;
   (b) made in CI. **Recommend (a).** The ESP32 job's container has no host `ac3cli`, and
   building one there would cost minutes on every run. Cost: the set is regenerated by hand when
   the decoder's output moves; until it is, CI fails, because it holds the target to the host's
   levels recorded in the manifest - which is the check doing its job.

3. **What a play is held to.** (a) **the host decoder's levels, as coded, placed by location and
   recorded in the manifest**; (b) the target's own first run, recorded. **Recommend (a)**, which
   is independent of the thing it checks. Cost: every stream in the set has to place exactly on
   7.1.4, so none has a channel 7.1.4 lacks (Lw, Rw, Vhc, Ts, Cs, LFE2); those are spread by the
   renderer, which `libs/render/tests/test_layout.cpp` covers on the host.

4. **Objects in CI's network shape.** (a) **played as their bed**; (b) placed, with the object
   streams left out of the plays; (c) placed, with room made - a smaller ring, a larger decode
   stack, smaller network buffers. **Recommend (a).** Placement was measured not to fit, and
   `sdkconfig.ci-render` keeps placing objects from FAT. Cost: no object placement over the
   network in CI.

5. **Two programmes.** (a) **the player plays the first programme a stream carries, and skips
   the others' access units before decoding them**, by the substream id in the header it already
   reads; (b) `DecoderConfig::programme` set to 0, which the decoder answers with an empty result
   the player would count as held; (c) left as it is. **Recommend (a).** (b) would count every
   unit of another programme as a held frame. Cost: a check of one header field per access unit,
   and no way to pick a second programme, which a later setting could add.

6. **A stream whose sample rate is not the sink's.** (a) **the player refuses it: the play fails
   with the reason `sample rate` and the stream's rate in `error`**; (b) the sink re-clocked for
   each play; (c) left as it is. **Recommend (a).** (b) needs every sink to reopen at another
   rate, which the I2S sink, standard or TDM, does not do today. Cost: a stream at 44.1 or 32 kHz,
   which a DAC could play at its own rate, does not play at all until (b).

7. **The coding tools 7.1.4 cannot carry without PSRAM.** (a) **in the set at 7.1.4, marked
   PSRAM-only, and at 5.1, which CI plays**; (b) left out of the set. **Recommend (a).** A board
   with PSRAM plays the 7.1.4 ones, as one did on 2026-09-11, and CI still decodes AHT, enhanced
   coupling and TPN through the player. Cost: 72 KB for the 5.1 streams. Since 2026-09-16 AHT is
   not one of these tools: CI plays `714-aht` and `714-all`
   ([Measured again on 2026-09-16](#measured-again-on-2026-09-16)).

8. **A wide programme folded to 2.0.** (a) **record it, and hand it to the decoder core**, with
   CI's folds at 2.0 made of 5.1 streams; (b) the player places a wide stream at `2.0` with its own
   renderer, panning each channel onto the pair, instead of the decoder's fold; (c) the player
   refuses a stream wider than 5.1.2 at `2.0`. **Recommend (a).** (b) would give two downmixes
   for one layout, §7.8's for some streams and a panner's for others, and (c) takes away a
   layout that works on a board with room. Cost: until the decoder changes, a 7.1, 5.1.4 or 7.1.4
   stream at `2.0` aborts a player without the internal RAM for the fold - QEMU's network shape
   is one, the board's is not - and a 7.1.4 stream at `2.0` falls behind real time over WiFi.
   Since 2026-09-11 the output stage folds 256 samples at a time, its largest allocation 1,024
   bytes, and 7.1.4 at `2.0` decodes at 1.00x real time on the board.
