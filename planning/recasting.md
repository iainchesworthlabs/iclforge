# Recasting ac3forge as a family: the library, Forge and Crucible

!!! success "Status as of 2026-10-01: phases 1 to 7 largely built; the naming decisions were overtaken"
    Written and decided 2026-09-05. **Phases 2 to 5 are in.** Phase 1 is in except the
    `AC3DESK_*` fold (49 uses remain under `apps/crucible`) and one sentence of Crucible's About
    dialog. Phase 4's display strings are in; Crucible's bundle identifier and a configure
    summary grouped by member are not. Phase 6 is partly in: the `ac3forge-crucible-*` packages,
    the release-doc rows and an extended DEB description for the Crucible and Hearth components
    exist, and the one-line synopsis `apt show` opens with still names the library. **Phase 7 was
    done early**, on 2026-10-01 as change N1D, before the driver was signed: the driver is
    `IclForgeNullSink` and its INF declares the endpoint as "Crucible Silent Output". Attestation
    is still to be paid for. Each phase below carries its own status line.

    **The naming decisions on this page were overtaken by the AC-4 programme.** On 2026-09-25 the
    user chose to rename the programs (decision 35 of [the AC-4 plan](ac4.md#decisions-of-2026-09-25)),
    and on 2026-09-26 chose the members' own names: `ac3cli`, `ac3gui`, `ac3hearth` and
    `ac3crucible` become `forge`, `forge-gui`, `hearth` and `crucible`. On 2026-09-29 the user named
    the family "ICL Forge" in place of `ac3forge` (identifiers `iclforge` and `ICLFORGE_`;
    plain `forge` is taken on PyPI, npm, crates.io and Homebrew core) and, reading that nothing
    is published, that no shim or kept-working period is needed. (Checked 2026-09-30: PyPI holds
    two prereleases of `ac3forge`, 0.9.0b1 and 0.10.0b1, and the Homebrew tap is public; npm and
    crates.io hold nothing under the family's names.) That replaces this page's decisions 2, 5
    and 6 and its recommended scheme S1: the scheme it costed as S3 was taken, with `forge` and
    `forge-gui`, and the family name changed as well.
    **The execution has run.** It was phase N1 of the AC-4 plan, in two tasks, N1A (the
    programs) and N1B (the libraries, studied in [layout.md](layout.md)); the user took the study's
    recommendations on 2026-09-30, and the tree and the docs use the new names since 2026-10-01
    ([N1](ac4.md#n1-the-names) lists the pull requests). This page keeps the names of its time
    (`ac3cli`, `ac3gui`, `ac3hearth`, `ac3crucible`, `ac3forge`).

    This page plans the recasting of the repository from one name over everything into three
    named products: **the library**, **Forge** (the `ac3cli` and `ac3gui` tooling) and
    **Crucible** ([the Crucible guide](../docs/crucible/index.md)). Hearth became a fourth member
    on 2026-09-07 ([the appliance plan](player-appliance.md#which-member-it-belongs-to)), and
    is built (`apps/hearth`, `libs/sendspin`); the tables below have no column for it. Design
    sections say what changes and why, each phase carries an exit criterion and says how it is
    verified, and [Decisions](#decisions) records the fifteen open questions and the option taken
    on each.

    The counts, line numbers and CI descriptions in the design sections are from the tree of
    2026-09-05 and are not kept current; where a statement has since been overtaken, a note in
    the section says so.

On 2026-09-05 `ac3forge` named everything at once. It was the repository, the site,
`project(ac3forge)` (`CMakeLists.txt:8`), the CPack package, the PyPI project, the vcpkg port, the
Conan recipe, the winget identifier, the Homebrew formula and its tap; it was the library
(`ac3::forge`, `libac3forge`, `find_package(ac3forge)`, 215 C functions prefixed `ac3forge_`); and
it was the tooling's product name, because the GUI set `setApplicationName("ac3forge")`, titled
its window `ac3forge — <source>` and headed its About box `ac3forge`, and `ac3cli` opened its
usage text with `ac3forge — clean-room AC-3 / E-AC-3`. The word appeared in 331 files. Crucible,
named on 2026-09-04, was the one member with a name of its own applied consistently: display
"Crucible", binary `ac3crucible`, namespace `ac3::crucible`, option `AC3FORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE`,
package `ac3forge-crucible`. "Forge" as a word on its own appeared nowhere in the tree. Phase 4
has since put "Forge" in the CLI's banner and the GUI's About box, with the family named beneath
it; `setApplicationName("ac3forge")` is unchanged.

This page names the members, says what each owns, and lists the cheapest way to make the family
visible without touching an identifier anyone has installed.

## The model

Three members, one family name, and a shared floor.

*This is the model of 2026-09-05. Hearth has since become a fourth member, and the family name and
the program names are to change in phase N1 of the AC-4 plan (see the status block above), so
"None of it changes" below no longer holds for the names.*

**The family is `ac3forge`.** The repository, the site, the CMake project, the CPack name, the
`v*` tag stream, the SBOM and signing-key names, the GitHub slug (91 files). None of it changes.

**The library** keeps the family's identifiers, because every published thing already carries
them: `ac3::forge`, `find_package(ac3forge)`, `ac3forge_c/ac3forge.h`, `import ac3forge`,
`libac3forge0`. It is `libs/ac3` and its siblings, the three bindings, the examples, the fuzz
harnesses, the conformance vectors and the footprint probe.

**Forge** is the tooling over the library: `ac3cli`, `ac3gui` and the `apps/shared/media/src` sources
they share. The tree already treats the pair as one thing in every generator and registry
(CPack component `runtime`; one `ac3forge` archive, installer, DEB, RPM, `.dmg` and winget
entry; docs/cli beside docs/gui). Forge is a display and docs name for that pair. Its binaries,
packages and paths stay as they are through 0.x.

**Crucible** is `apps/crucible`, `apps/crucible/engine/tests`, `docs/crucible`, the `crucible` component and
its packages, and by purpose the Windows null-sink driver in `apps/crucible/windows/driver`, which stays
under its own name until attestation signing lands.

**The shared floor** belongs to the family and to no member: `libs/audio`, which is never
installed (`cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake:4-7`) and is linked by `ac3cli`, `ac3gui`,
`ac3crucible_engine` and the Shield JNI; `tools/`; the single `ac3tests` binary; CI; the
packaging tooling; the version line.

**Beside the family, joining no member:** the Shield app under `apps/demos/android`, documented as
the library's Android demo, and the browser pages under `apps/demos/wasm`, documented as the library's
live demos, with the npm package listed among the library's bindings.

## What each member owns

| | The library | Forge | Crucible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source | `libs/ac3`, `src/signing`, `libs/capi`, `libs/containers/src/matroska`, `libs/containers/src/mp4`, `libs/containers/src/mpegts`, `libs/iab`, `libs/containers/src/iamf`, `libs/adm`, `libs/adm`, `libs/ac4` (built, never exported); `python/`, `js/`, `rust/`; `examples/`, `fuzz/`, `apps/baremetal` | `apps/forge/cli/src`, `apps/forge/gui`, `apps/shared/media/src` | `apps/crucible`; by purpose `apps/crucible/windows/driver` and `driver-vm` |
| Build identity | `ac3::forge`, `ac3::forge_c`, `ac3::signing`, `matroska::matroska`, `mp4::mp4`, `mpegts::mpegts`, `ac3iab::ac3iab`, `iamf::iamf`, `ac3adm::ac3adm`, `ac3::admbridge`; ten export sets and ten `.pc` files | targets `ac3cli`, `ac3gui`; QML URI `Ac3Forge`; options `AC3FORGE_BUILD_CLI`, `AC3FORGE_BUILD_GUI` | targets `ac3crucible`, `ac3crucible-run`, `ac3::crucible_engine`; QML URI `Ac3ForgeCrucible`; option `AC3FORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE`; root guard `WIN32 OR (UNIX AND NOT APPLE)` (`CMakeLists.txt:450`) |
| Tests and checks | most of `ac3tests`; `libs/capi/tests`, `python/tests`, `apps/demos/wasm/tests`; coverage floors `src/*` (`tools/checks/coverage_report.sh:108-116`); abi-gate; fuzz.yml; interop.yml | `apps/forge/cli/tests`, `tests/gui`, `ac3gui_qmltests` (label `gui`); floor `apps/forge/cli/src` (:117); `.clang-tidy:95` | `apps/crucible/engine/tests` (compiled into `ac3tests`, `tests/CMakeLists.txt:436-456`), `ac3crucible_qmltests`; labels `crucible`, `crucible-ui`; `tools/ci/check_crucible_package.py`; `tools/checks/coverage_crucible.ps1`, `crucible_platform_probe.cpp` |
| Docs | Library (22 pages), Concepts (4), Validation, Threat model, Conformance vectors, Performance & quality (6), `platforms/wasm.md`, the two WASM demo pages | CLI reference (3), GUI guide (12) | Crucible guide (5), `platforms/windows-demo.md` (the record), `platforms/windows-driver-acx.md` |
| Packages | `ac3forge-dev-<full>-<sys>`; DEB `libac3forge0`, `libac3forge-dev`; RPM `libac3forge0`, `ac3forge-devel`; PyPI `ac3forge` (live); npm `ac3forge-wasm-decoder` (unpublished); crates `ac3forge`, `ac3forge-sys` (unpublished); vcpkg port and Conan recipe `ac3forge` (staged); `ac3forge-conformance-vectors-<ver>.tar.gz` | component `runtime`: `ac3forge-<M.m.p>-<sys>` zip/tgz, NSIS `.exe`, DEB/RPM `ac3forge`, `.dmg`; `ac3gui-*.AppImage`; winget `iainchesworthlabs.ac3forge` (4 versions staged); Homebrew formula `ac3forge` and cask `ac3gui` (live tap) | component `crucible`: `ac3forge-crucible-<full>-<sys>` zip/tgz, DEB/RPM `ac3forge-crucible` (no tag contains it yet) |
| CI | all 11 matrix legs; `build-rust`, `build-wasm`, `build-footprint`; wheels.yml, npm.yml | legs with `gui: true` (Linux GCC/LLVM, both arm64, both macOS; Windows always); `linux-appimage`; ffmpeg-validate builds `ac3cli` | `crucible: true` on windows-msvc, windows-llvm, linux-llvm, linux-llvm-arm64 (`_build.yml:329,342,430,487`); `windows-driver` |
| Settings and ids | none | QSettings `ac3forge`/`ac3forge`; bundle id `com.iainchesworthlabs.ac3gui`; ProgID `AC3Forge.Stream` | QSettings `ac3forge`/`Crucible` (migrated from `DesktopAtmos`, `apps/crucible/ui/src/main.cpp:38-60`); no bundle id yet |

Three things do not sit in one column and the plan says where they go.

- **`libs/audio`** stays private and is named, in the family docs, as the shared platform layer.
  Crucible includes `libs/audio/src/backend/pipewire` directly
  (`apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt:81-82`); promoting those helpers to `ac3/audio/` headers is a
  follow-up outside this plan, and exporting the library is not proposed (it would put WASAPI,
  ALSA and PipeWire dependencies into a package that declares none).
- **The Shield app** keeps `com.ac3forge.shield` and its `.apk`; its display name is
  [decision 10](#decisions).
- **`apps/demos/wasm` and `js/`** are library documentation and a library binding
  ([decision 11](#decisions)); nothing moves.

## The name

Two facts constrain the naming. The word "forge" already means the library in every
consumer-facing identifier (`ac3::forge`, `libs/ac3`, `forgeTargets.cmake`, `ac3::forge_c`,
`ac3::forge_minimal`, `libac3forge`, `ac3forge.pc`, and 23 docs pages that say `ac3::forge`).
And the family's spelling differs by surface: `ac3forge` in 5,016 sites, `AC3Forge` only inside
"AC3Forge Crucible" (53 sites) and the NSIS ProgID `AC3Forge.Stream`, `Ac3Forge` in the QML
URIs, the driver and the npm exports.

| Scheme | Family | Library | Forge | Crucible | Binaries | Packages | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **S1, recommended** | `ac3forge` in identifiers, "AC3Forge" in prose | "the ac3forge library"; `ac3::forge` unchanged | the `ac3cli` + `ac3gui` pair; "Forge" in docs, nav, README, the About heading and the CLI banner, with the family named beneath | as now | unchanged | unchanged | about ten display sites, `lupdate`, recaptured screenshots, one sentence on two index pages; the word "forge" keeps two meanings |
| S2, per-member package tokens | as S1 | as S1 | runtime archive `forge-<ver>-<sys>`, DEB/RPM `forge`, winget `iainchesworthlabs.Forge`, formula `forge` | `crucible-*`, DEB/RPM `crucible` | unchanged | renamed | deprecation paths for the NSIS installer, DEB/RPM `ac3forge`, the formula token and the winget identifier; availability checks for two generic words in seven namespaces; three tools' hardcoded asset patterns |
| S3, Forge-branded binaries | as S1 | as S1 | `ac3forge`/`ac3forge-gui`, or `forge`/`forge-gui` | `crucible` for symmetry | renamed | as S1 or S2 | `ac3cli` in 252 files, four shells' completions, the man page, four winget manifest versions, the formula; `ac3forge.exe` beside `ac3forge.dll`/`.pdb` from `libs/ac3/CMakeLists.txt:622`; every user's script |
| S4, rename the library's identifiers | as S1 | `ac3::codec` or similar | Forge is unambiguous | as now | unchanged | `libac3forge0` and the `-dev` packages renamed | the C ABI, the ABI allowlists, every package config and registry, 683 files using `ac3::`, 245 using `AC3FORGE_`; a breaking release |
| S5, a new umbrella name | new | `ac3forge` becomes a member name | Forge | Crucible | any | every published id | 331 files; the repository, Pages URL, PyPI trusted publisher, tap name and every verify snippet key on the literal `ac3forge` |

**What was decided instead.** The user's choices of 2026-09-25 to 2026-09-29 are none of these rows
as written. The programs take the names S3 offered as `forge` and `forge-gui`, with `hearth` and
`crucible` beside them. The family is renamed as well, which is S5's umbrella-name row with
`iclforge` as the identifier and "ICL Forge" in prose; and the identifiers that carry the family
name go with it, as S4 costed: N1B renames the C API prefix, the CMake package, the Kconfig
prefix, the environment variables and the wire strings outright, with no shim
([the AC-4 plan](ac4.md#n1-the-names)). The C++ namespace is a question the layout study puts to
the user (its decision 2), and the answer was `iclforge`. **Done by N1**: the tree uses the new
names. The three rules below are S1's, and N1 replaced them (CONTRIBUTING.md has the current ones).

Under S1 three rules are written down once, on the Library index page, the Forge index page and
in CONTRIBUTING.md:

1. `ac3forge` and `ac3::forge` name the library and the family's identifiers. **Forge**,
   capitalised and standing alone, names the tooling.
2. "AC3Forge" is the family in prose; every identifier stays lowercase. "AC3Forge Crucible" and
   "Forge" are the member names; "AC3Forge Forge" is never written.
3. `ac3cli --version` keeps printing `ac3forge <version>` (`src/ac3/src/version.cpp:19-21`):
   it is the library's version line, and the live Homebrew formula's test asserts it
   (`packaging/homebrew/Formula/iclforge.rb:65`).

The tooling's namespaces are the one code-level inconsistency worth folding while here:
`ac3cli` and `ac3cli::commands` (38 declarations), `ac3::cli::platform` (3), `ac3gui` (2) and
`ac3::apps` against Crucible's `ac3::crucible`. A fold to `ac3::cli`, `ac3::gui` and `ac3::apps`
is internal, touches no consumer, and is optional ([Phase 4](#phase-4-display-strings-and-in-tree-identities)).
It was not made: `namespace ac3cli` is in 41 files and `namespace ac3gui` in 18, and Hearth has
`ac3::hearth` beside Crucible's.

## Directory layout

Recommended: nothing moves. The tree already separates the members at the directory level
(`src/`, `apps/forge/cli/src` + `apps/forge/gui` + `apps/shared/media/src`, `apps/crucible`), and the places that would
say the family are prose: the README's layout block, CONTRIBUTING's layout rule, the configure
summary.

**As built, and overtaken.** The only move the table below advised against that happened is in
`docs/`: on 2026-09-14 the CLI reference and the GUI guide went to `docs/forge/cli/` and
`docs/forge/gui/`, Crucible's promotion record to `docs/crucible/design/`, and the flat
bare-metal page was split into `docs/platforms/bare-metal/` (#674). The tree also gained
`apps/hearth`, `libs/sendspin`, `libs/base` and the four AC-4 libraries, `libs/ac4`,
`libs/ac4`. N1B ([layout.md](layout.md)) reopens the source
layout: its recommended L2 renames `libs/ac3` to `libs/ac3` and takes five libraries that know
no codec out of it, so that AC-4 sits beside AC-3 and E-AC-3. That study is a proposal, and
its decisions are with the user.

| Path | Today | After (recommended) | The move that was considered, and what it breaks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `libs/ac3`, `src/*` | the library | unchanged | renaming to `libs/ac3` frees the word for the tooling at the cost of 24 CMake files, wheels.yml and interop.yml triggers, `.clang-tidy:95`, the coverage floors, `cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake`'s header install paths, and 385 commits of directory history |
| `apps/forge/cli/src`, `apps/forge/gui`, `apps/shared/media/src` | Forge | unchanged | `apps/forge/{cli,gui,common}` breaks `CMakeLists.txt:437-441`, `.clang-tidy:95`, the `apps/forge/cli/src` floor row, interop.yml's path filter, 14 `apps/forge/gui` references in `apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt` (icons, fonts, four QML files, `ac3gui.rc.in`, `system_theme`), `cmake/Packaging.cmake:58-59`, 34 workflow path lines, 17 tool and cmake files, 61 doc path mentions, and `git log -- apps/forge/cli/src` (296 commits) |
| `apps/crucible` | Crucible | unchanged | none proposed |
| `apps/crucible/windows/driver`, `driver-vm` | Crucible's driver, frozen | unchanged until signing; optionally `apps/crucible/driver` in the signing-time change | breaks the `windows-driver` job's paths, `apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt:372-376`, driver-vm's relative paths, and the signing session's checkout |
| `apps/demos/android` | the Shield demo | unchanged | a `demos/` parent breaks the depth-sensitive `add_subdirectory("${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../../..")` (`apps/demos/android/app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt:66`), the Android and CodeQL job paths |
| `apps/demos/wasm`, `js/` | library demos and binding | unchanged | a `web/` parent breaks docs.yml's and npm.yml's path triggers, `build-wasm`'s working directory, `js/package.json:23` `directory: "js"`, and the relative loads inside the checked-in `docs/assets/wasm-*-demo` bundles |
| `python/`, `rust/` | bindings | unchanged | `pyproject.toml:37` `cmake.source-dir = ".."` and `:77` `root = ".."`, wheels.yml `package-dir`, `rust/iclforge-sys/build.rs:9-13` (asserts it lives two directories below the root) |
| `tests/` | one `ac3tests` | unchanged | a per-member binary duplicates `tests/CMakeLists.txt`'s backend, ADM and IAB conditionals for no gate that does not already key on source paths |
| `docs/` | 73 pages | 73 pages plus `docs/forge/index.md`, `docs/family/recasting.md` (this page), and, under [decision 8](#decisions), `docs/library/capabilities.md` and a `docs/security.md` wrapper | see [The docs](#the-docs) |

What does change on disk is small: the README's layout block gains member headings and the rows
it is missing today (`libs/capi`, `libs/ac4`, `libs/iab`, `libs/containers/src/iamf`, `libs/adm`,
`apps/demos/wasm`, `apps/shared/media/src`, `apps/baremetal`, `apps/crucible/windows`, `python/`, `js/`, `rust/`), and
`CONTRIBUTING.md:50-51`'s consumer list `apps/{cli,gui,wasm,android}` names the tree as it is.

## Packaging and release identities

Under the recommended scheme every token below is unchanged. The table records what each is,
which member owns it, and what a rename would need, so the cost of any later scheme is on the
page rather than discovered.

**As of 2026-09-30, and overtaken.** The State column is from 2026-09-05; checked against the
registries and the tree on 2026-09-30, it still holds: PyPI has `ac3forge` 0.9.0b1 and 0.10.0b1;
npm has no `ac3forge-wasm-decoder`, and crates.io no `ac3forge` or `ac3forge-sys`; the tap
`iainchesworthlabs/homebrew-ac3forge` is public; the four winget versions are staged; and the
latest release, v0.10.0-beta.1 (2026-09-01), carries no Crucible or Hearth package. The last two
columns cost a rename with compatibility paths. N1 renames the tokens in the table outright
instead, with no path: the family's in N1B (its naming map is in
[layout.md](layout.md#e-the-naming-map)) and the programs' registrations in N1A. The costs it
names are GitHub's, the repository name, the Pages address, release tags and asset names.

The first tag that contains Crucible freezes three release-shape facts ([decision
13](#decisions)). All three are settled: two changed, and one was examined and deliberately left
as it is.

1. **The Linux Crucible package is a release asset.** *Settled.* Both linux-llvm legs package the
   component on every run and upload it as `packages-crucible-<preset>`
   (`_build.yml:1652-1660`, renamed in 99d08210), which is the `packages-*` pattern release.yml
   downloads (`release.yml:275-279`) and attaches file by file (`:538-549`); the `.deb` and
   `.tar.gz` globs in release.yml's checksum, signing, provenance and SBOM steps cover both
   files. One thing stays true of that route: neither leg carries `release_package`, so the
   packages ride on the artifact glob rather than on a release gate. The other qualification
   recorded here — that the leg was x86_64 alone, so no release carried an aarch64 Linux Crucible
   package — closed on 2026-09-06, when linux-llvm-arm64 took the same pass and its own pair
   joined the same artifact glob ([the promotion plan](../docs/crucible/design/promotion.md), Phase 8,
   records what that took and what it asserts). No tag has been cut since, so the route is
   wired and not yet exercised by a published release.
2. **Two version-string styles in one release.** *Deliberate*, and [decision
   13](#decisions) says why. The runtime archive, `.exe` and `.dmg` carry
   `M.m.p` (`cmake/Packaging.cmake:357-360`; the cask parses it, `Casks/ac3gui.rb:45-54`); the
   `crucible` and `dev` archives carry `PROJECT_VERSION_FULL` with the prerelease suffix
   (:363-365).
3. **The experimental claim.** *Settled.* docs/releasing.md said no leg was `experimental: true`
   while `windows-msvc-arm64` was both `experimental: true` and `release_package: true`
   (`_build.yml:388-393`). That page now says what the workflow does: the leg ships packages,
   and `continue-on-error` means a failure there does not block the release.

A fourth, cosmetic and already noted in `cmake/Packaging.cmake:183-191`: every DEB component's
one-line synopsis is the library's `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`, so `apt show ac3forge-crucible` opens
with "Clean-room AC-3 encoder". CPack offers no per-component override that takes effect; the
family docs say so and this plan does not fight it.

## The docs

!!! note "The counts in this section are as of 2026-09-05, when the page was written"
    The regroup below has since landed, and grown. On 2026-09-08 `main` carried seven tabs and 81
    pages; on 2026-09-30 it carries ten top-level entries and 100 pages, all of them in the nav:
    Home, Getting started, Library, Validation, Performance & quality, Forge, Crucible, Hearth,
    Platforms and Project. It differs from the plan below in these ways. Concepts sits under
    Getting started, and Validation and Performance & quality are tabs of their own rather than
    parts of Library. Hearth has a tab. The CLI reference and the GUI guide moved to
    `docs/forge/cli/` and `docs/forge/gui/` on 2026-09-14 (#674), where the plan said no page
    moves. `docs/forge/index.md`, `docs/library/capabilities.md` and `docs/security.md` exist, as
    proposed. This page and the other plans are not on the site: they were taken off it on
    2026-09-08, so the `family/recasting.md` entry below does not exist. No line of the nav is
    cited, here or anywhere else in this section, because every addition moves it. The "Today"
    columns and the "Before" list below are kept as written, because they are what the plan
    reasoned from.

The site had 73 pages under 12 tabs when this was written. Crucible is absent from the home page,
the quick start and the concepts overview; `README.md:64-68` still places it in `apps/crucible/windows/`
and links the historical record instead of the guide. The library owns most of the tree; the
tools own two tabs; Crucible owns the one it gained on 2026-09-05.

Two constraints decide the shape. `mkdocs build --strict` (docs.yml) validates internal links
and nothing outside `docs/`, and the tree already carries two stale sets from earlier moves
(CHANGELOG.md:1519,1801,1901,1996 link `docs/project/history.md`;
`tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh:7,29,187` cite `docs/RESEARCH.md`). And `mkdocs.yml`
declares no plugins, so there is no redirects plugin, while published metadata pins today's URLs:
`js/package.json:19` (`platforms/wasm/`), `python/pyproject.toml:26` (`library/python-api/`),
`ac3crucible.metainfo.xml` (`crucible/`), and four winget manifests
(`docs/releasing.md#what-gets-published`).

So the nav regroups and the files stay. Material's `navigation.tabs` renders each top-level
entry as a tab and `navigation.indexes` lets a section open on an `index.md` that is its first
child; `library/index.md` and `crucible/index.md` exist, and Forge gains one.

Before: Home · Getting started (quickstart, building, 8 platform pages) · Concepts (4) ·
Validation · Threat model · Conformance vectors · Library (22) · CLI reference (3) · GUI guide
(12) · Crucible guide (5) · Performance & quality (6) · Project (7).

After, seven tabs:

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md                       # the three products, one paragraph and one link each
  - Getting started:
      - Quick start: quickstart.md
      - Building from source: building.md
  - Library:
      - Conventions: library/index.md
      - Capabilities: library/capabilities.md      # decision 8(b): the tables from index.md
      - Concepts:                                  # concepts/ (4 pages), unchanged paths
      - Using the library:                         # library/ (19 pages), unchanged paths
      - Bindings:

          - Conformance vectors: conformance-vectors.md
      - Performance & quality:                     # the 6 pages, unchanged
      - Live demos:

          - Encode in the browser: wasm-encode-demo.md
  - Forge:

      - The signal path: crucible/signal-path.md
      - Troubleshooting: crucible/troubleshooting.md
      - Promotion plan & record: crucible/design/promotion.md
      - The Windows demo, the record: platforms/windows-demo.md      # relabelled, not moved
      - The null-sink driver on ACX: platforms/windows-driver-acx.md # relabelled, not moved
  - Platforms:
      - Windows: platforms/windows.md
      - Linux: platforms/linux.md
      - Raspberry Pi: platforms/raspberry-pi.md
      - macOS: platforms/macos.md
      - Android, the Shield demo: platforms/android.md
  - Project:
      - Contributing: contributing.md
      - Releasing: releasing.md
      - Security policy: security.md               # new wrapper over SECURITY.md, optional
      - History: history.md
      - Roadmap: roadmap.md
      - The family recasting: family/recasting.md  # this page
      - Self-hosted CI runners: ci-self-hosted-runners.md
```

`docs/forge/index.md` is the page that says what Forge is and how to get it: the three install
paths lifted from `docs/cli/index.md:22-45` (winget, Homebrew, the release archives), the
sentence about the word "forge", and links into the CLI reference and GUI guide.
`docs/gui/index.md:8` then points at it instead of `../cli/index.md#installing`.

`README.md` leads with the family: the H1, one sentence saying the project is one clean-room
AC-3/E-AC-3/Atmos codec and two applications built on it, then a three-row table (Library: what
it is, how to get it, where its docs are; Forge; Crucible), then the trademark and status
paragraphs unchanged, an "Also in the tree" line for the Shield demo and the browser demos, and
the existing Building, Validation (labelled as the library's numbers), Repository layout
(grouped by member), Documentation and Licence sections. The two authority statements that
contradict each other (`README.md:37` says the docs are current; `docs/history.md:5-7` says the
README is right) resolve to what `CONTRIBUTING.md:261-266` already says: `docs/index.md` and
`docs/verification.md` own the capability claims.

Cross-mentions that read as one product are reworded, without moving: `docs/platforms/linux.md:120-128`,
`docs/platforms/windows.md:100-102`, `docs/gui/localisation.md:49-57` (which still says "The
Windows demo (`apps/crucible/windows/`)"), `docs/library/muxing-and-sinks.md:698` (which links
"AC3Forge Crucible" to the record instead of the guide), and the "Where to go next" list at
`docs/index.md:254-265`, which gains Crucible.

## The roadmap

!!! warning "Historical — superseded 2026-09-17"
    This section planned the old nine-theme ID model (`EQ`, `UX`, `AP10`, …). The roadmap was
    rebuilt as a slim status board with plain-English names and no new numeric IDs. Treat
    [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) and [planning/SUPERSEDED.md](SUPERSEDED.md) as current; keep this
    section only for recasting phase context.

`ROADMAP.md`'s nine themes are library themes except UX and DR, which hold Forge, Crucible, WASM
and Shield items under one code each. IDs are load-bearing: 389 citations in
src/apps/tests/tools/cmake/.github, 99 in docs, 11 in CHANGELOG.md, and the header (lines 6-8)
promises they are stable. So the regrouping is a tag, not a renumbering:

- The Overview table (lines 13-25) gains a Member column, and the UX row is recounted: it reads
  9/0/1 while the section holds UX12 under In progress (line 2389) and UX7 and UX10 under
  Considering.
- Each UX, DR, IM and AP item's first line carries its member, in the form
  `**UX12 (XL, Crucible)**`; the seven codec themes are tagged once at the theme heading.
- Future Crucible items take a new code (`CR1`...) so the Overview can count them; UX11 and UX12
  stay where they are with a one-line pointer.
- DR stays the shared distribution theme with per-item tags.
- The two DR8 record links at lines 2631-2632 (`platforms/macos.md#...`,
  `releasing.md#what-gets-published`) are docs-relative and 404 on GitHub; the rule from the
  dual-context fix (inline code, or an absolute `https://github.com/.../blob/main/docs/...` URL,
  as line 2271 does) is applied to them and written into `docs/roadmap.md`'s wrapper so the next
  author sees it.

## CI

*This section describes the CI of 2026-09-05. Since 2026-09-29 pull requests run `pr-gate.yml`, whose
planner decides what a change builds, the merge queue adds Windows MSVC and the Qt GUI, and the
legs in the table below run after the merge ([CI for many agents](../docs/ci-agentic.md)). There
are 28 workflow files. The legs are now defined in `_ci-windows.yml`, `_ci-linux.yml` and
`_ci-macos.yml`, which `_build.yml` calls, and the docs-only rule described below is now the
planner's "documentation only" class.*

Seventeen workflow files; `_build.yml` is the reusable matrix (11 legs) plus eight standalone
jobs; `ci.yml` aggregates 22 jobs behind the required check `CI Status`
(`.github/branch-protection.md:27-31`, alongside `Branch Name` and `Scan dependency diff`).

| Leg or job | Member exercised | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| windows-msvc | library, Forge, Crucible | `packageable`, `release_package`, `crucible` |
| windows-llvm | library, Forge, Crucible | `packageable`, `crucible` |
| windows-msvc-arm64 | library, Forge (CLI only) | `experimental`, `packageable`, `release_package` |
| linux-gcc, linux-gcc-arm64 | library, Forge | `gui`, `packageable`, `release_package` |
| linux-llvm | library, Forge, Crucible (the PipeWire pass, x86_64) | `gui`, `packageable`, `crucible` |
| linux-llvm-arm64 | library, Forge, Crucible (the same pass, aarch64) | `gui`, `packageable`, `crucible` |
| linux-llvm-asan-ubsan, linux-llvm-tsan | library | |
| macos-llvm, macos-llvm-x64 | library, Forge | `gui`, `packageable` |
| package-macos-universal, linux-appimage | Forge | |
| build-android | the Shield demo | |
| build-wasm, build-rust, build-footprint | library | |
| windows-driver | Crucible's driver | |
| wheels.yml, npm.yml, fuzz.yml, interop.yml, abi-gate, coverage | library (coverage also gates `apps/forge/cli/src`) | |

Under the recommended scheme no leg is added, renamed or reflagged. The job names that are
branch-protection contracts, the `packages-*` artifact prefix and the ctest labels `gui`,
`crucible`, `crucible-ui` and `Performance` are left alone. Two CI facts shape the phases:
`ci.yml`'s `changes` job classifies a PR as docs-only by the regex at line 311 (`docs/`, any
`*.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, docs.yml), so a phase that touches only prose runs the docs strict build
and skips the matrix; a phase that touches a CMake help string or a display string runs all
eleven legs. And docs.yml's deploy job rebuilds and byte-compares the WASM demo bundles
(lines 80-108), so the nav regroup must not touch `docs/assets/`.

## Phases

Each ends with something that can be checked and says how. Phases 1 and 2 are the same under
every scheme and can start before a single decision is taken. Phase 3 onward depends on the
decisions named in each.

### Phase 1: the stale facts and Crucible's loose ends

**Status, 2026-09-30: in, except two items.** The README, CONTRIBUTING, the option's help string,
the comments in `tests/CMakeLists.txt` and `coverage_crucible.ps1`, the `.desktop` `GenericName`,
the six translation catalogues, the QML tests' settings store and the gold-reference script's
comments were corrected. Not done: the `AC3DESK_*` fold, of which 49 uses remain in
`apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt`, `apps/crucible/ui/tests/CMakeLists.txt` and
`crucible_controller.{cpp,hpp}`, so the exit criterion's grep is not empty; and the About dialog's
text still ends with "An ac3forge demonstration".

One rename already happened and left the tree saying two things. This phase makes the current
state true everywhere before the family is drawn over it.

- `README.md:64-68`: Crucible is under `apps/crucible/`, on Windows and Linux, documented in
  `docs/crucible/index.md`. The layout block (`README.md:162-189`) says the driver and its guest
  live under `apps/crucible`; they live under `apps/crucible/windows`. The Documentation table row 206
  links the record; it links the guide.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md:50-51`: `apps/{cli,gui,wasm,android}` names a tree that also holds
  `crucible`, `common`, `baremetal` and `windows`.
- `CMakeLists.txt:138`: the `AC3FORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE` help string says "Windows only".
- `tests/CMakeLists.txt:416-424`: the comment says `apps/windows/engine/` and "Windows-only".
- `tools/checks/coverage_crucible.ps1:1-6` and `CMakePresets.json:280`: both say `apps/crucible/windows`.
- `docs/gui/localisation.md:49-57` and `docs/library/muxing-and-sinks.md:698` as above.
- `ROADMAP.md:13-25`: the UX row; lines 2631-2632: the two relative links.
- The 50 `AC3DESK_*` CMake variables in `apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt`,
  `ui/crucible_controller.{cpp,hpp}` and `ui/tests/CMakeLists.txt` become `AC3CRUCIBLE_*`;
  `apps/crucible/ui/tests/qml_test_main.cpp:38` isolates under `DesktopAtmos` and should isolate
  under `Crucible`.
- `apps/crucible/ui/assets/qml/AboutDialog.qml:58` still says "An ac3forge demonstration"; the
  product's wording replaces it. `ac3crucible.desktop:4` `GenericName=Desktop Atmos Mixer` uses
  the mark as a generic name; `Application audio mixer` or similar. The six
  `ac3crucible_*.ts` files still carry `Desktop Atmos` as source text (13 in `ac3crucible_de.ts`):
  `cmake --build <dir> --target ac3crucible_lupdate` regenerates them.
- The four CHANGELOG links to `docs/project/history.md` and the three `docs/RESEARCH.md` comments
  in `verify_gold_reference.sh`.

What stays: `null_sink_substring = "Desktop Atmos"` (`engine.hpp:33`, `output_stage.hpp:52`),
the driver's name in the About licence line, and every mention inside the driver subtree, the
CHANGELOG, ROADMAP records, `promotion.md` and `windows-demo.md`. They change in
[Phase 7](#phase-7-the-driver-at-signing-time).

**Exit:** a grep for `AC3DESK` under `apps/`, `tools/`, `cmake/` and `tests/` returns nothing;
"Desktop Atmos" outside the records and the driver appears only as the endpoint-match string,
its tests and fakes, and the driver's own name; the README, CONTRIBUTING, the help string, the
comments and the coverage header describe the tree as it is.

**Verified by:** `cmake --preset config-windows-msvc -DAC3FORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE=ON`, build, and
`ctest --preset test-windows-msvc -L crucible` plus `-L crucible-ui`; the same on Linux with the
command `docs/crucible/install.md:84-90` gives (`config-linux-gcc`, `-DAC3FORGE_WITH_ALSA=OFF
-DAC3FORGE_WITH_PIPEWIRE=ON`); `mkdocs build --strict`; the greps above; the `.ts` diff shows
only source-string changes.

### Phase 2: a path-literal check

**Status, 2026-09-30: built.** `tools/checks/check_doc_paths.py` exists and runs in the Script
Lint job, which now lives in `_static.yml`. Its prose exemption list names the plans by file.

Every earlier move left a stale path somewhere `--strict` cannot see. Before any page or nav
moves, a small check makes that class of drift visible: `tools/checks/check_doc_paths.py`
resolves every markdown link target under `docs/`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`
and `CHANGELOG.md`, and every `docs/...md`, `apps/...`, `src/...`, `tools/...` path literal in
`.github/workflows/*.yml`, `cmake/*.cmake`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json` and
`tools/**`, against the tree. It joins `ci.yml`'s `script-lint` job.

It has since been widened twice, on the evidence that the first scope was too narrow: it now
also reads the paths a documentation page names in its own prose and code spans, and expands
brace groups rather than skipping them. Plans, phase records and `CHANGELOG.md` are exempt from
the prose check by name, because they describe proposed or past layouts on purpose.

**Exit:** the check is green on `main` after Phase 1's fixes.

**Verified by:** the check's own run in CI; and once, on a scratch branch, a deliberately broken
link turns it red.

### Phase 3: the family statement

**Status, 2026-09-30: built, with differences.** The README opens with a table of the family, now
four rows (the library, Forge, Crucible and Hearth); `docs/index.md`, `quickstart.md` and
`concepts/index.md` each name Crucible; `docs/forge/index.md`, `docs/library/capabilities.md` and
`docs/security.md` exist; and "AC3Forge Forge" is written nowhere as a name. The three naming
rules are in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and not on the Library and Forge index pages. The nav has ten
top-level entries where the plan had seven, and the CLI and GUI pages moved (#674): see the note
in [The docs](#the-docs).

Depends on decisions 1, 3, 7, 8, 10 and 11. Lands the README first screen, the `docs/index.md`
landing page (and `docs/library/capabilities.md` under 8(b)), the seven-tab nav,
`docs/forge/index.md`, this page in the nav, the CONTRIBUTING layout rule, the `security.md`
wrapper if wanted, the reworded cross-mentions, the three naming rules on the Library and Forge
index pages, and the Shield and WASM placements. No file under `docs/` moves and no URL changes.

**Exit:** a reader arriving at the home page, the README or any tab sees three products and can
reach each member's guide and its download in one link; the phrase "AC3Forge Forge" appears
nowhere; `docs/index.md`, `quickstart.md` and `concepts/index.md` each name Crucible at least
once.

**Verified by:** `mkdocs build --strict`; the Phase 2 check; `mkdocs serve` and a walk of all
seven tabs; the README rendered on GitHub; `grep -rn "AC3Forge Forge"` returns nothing; docs.yml's
bundle comparison still passes (nothing under `docs/assets/` changed).

### Phase 4: display strings and in-tree identities

**Status, 2026-09-30: partly built.** In: the CLI banner and the GUI's About box say "Forge" with
the family beneath ("Forge — the AC3Forge encoder tools"), the `ac3gui.desktop` `Comment`, and the
`ac3cli --version` line, which still prints `ac3forge <version>`. `setApplicationName` and the
settings stores are unchanged. Not built: Crucible's `MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER` (the GUI's and
Hearth's are set, `com.iainchesworthlabs.ac3gui` and `com.iainchesworthlabs.ac3hearth`), the
configure summary grouped by member (it prints CLI, GUI, tests, examples and Python, and no line
for Crucible or Hearth being built), and the optional namespace fold. The CLI banner names AC-4;
the `ac3gui.desktop` text still says AC-3 and E-AC-3 alone, and phase N1A of the AC-4 plan
rewrites that wording.

Depends on decisions 2, 3, 4 and 12. Lands the About heading and CLI usage banner (`usage.cpp:760`;
the man page `.TH` line at :793 keeps `ac3forge` as the version source), the `.desktop`
`Comment` lines, the H1 casing under decision 3, the root option help strings and the configure
summary grouped by member (`CMakeLists.txt:499-503` prints CLI/GUI/tests/examples/Python and
nothing about Crucible), Crucible's `MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER`, and, optionally, the
namespace fold `ac3cli` → `ac3::cli`, `ac3gui` → `ac3::gui`. `setApplicationName`,
`setOrganizationName`, the window title format, the `.desktop` `Name`, the AppStream `<name>`
and `ac3::version_details()` do not change.

**Exit:** every changed string is in the seven `ac3gui_*.ts` and six `ac3crucible_*.ts` files;
the GUI's settings are read from the same store as before; `ac3cli --version` still prints
`ac3forge <version>`.

**Verified by:** a PR touching `apps/` runs all eleven legs; `ctest -L gui` and `-L crucible-ui`;
`ac3gui_lupdate`/`ac3crucible_lupdate` regenerated and diffed; on Windows, run the built `ac3gui`
and confirm `HKCU\Software\ac3forge\ac3forge` is the store it reads; the Homebrew formula's test
string (`Formula/ac3forge.rb:65`) unchanged; screenshots in `docs/gui/screenshots/` recaptured
where the About box or banner appears, and `mkdocs build --strict` after.

### Phase 5: the roadmap

**Status, 2026-09-30: built on 2026-09-06, then superseded.** On 2026-09-17 the roadmap was
rebuilt as a status board with plain-English names and no new numeric IDs
([ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md), [roadmap-inventory.md](roadmap-inventory.md)), so the Member column,
the per-item tags and the counts below no longer exist. The `CR1` item survives as "Crucible
translations" in the board's partial tails.

Depends on decision 9. Lands the Member column, the tags, the recount, the `CR` code, the two
link fixes and the wrapper note.

**Exit:** the Overview counts equal the section counts for every theme; no `](…)` href in
`ROADMAP.md` is docs-relative.

**Verified by:** `mkdocs build --strict` (the wrapper includes the file); the Phase 2 check;
opening `ROADMAP.md` on GitHub and following each of the DR8 links; a one-off count of
`**XXn (` lines per section against the table.

!!! success "Done 2026-09-06"
    `ROADMAP.md` carries a Member column and per-item tags. Each theme states its member once,
    under the heading, and an item belonging to a different one carries its own tag in the
    `**UX12 (XL, Crucible)**` form; the rule is written into the file's opening so the next
    author does not have to infer it from the tags. Forty-eight existing items carry one —
    every IM, AP, UX and DR item, as decision 9 asked, plus the four IO items that reach the
    CLI (IO1, IO2, IO8, IO9) and the four VX items that reach an application or the whole
    repository (VX14, VX15, VX22, VX23), without which those two theme headings would have
    been false.

    **The recount.** Counted off the sections rather than trusted. Eight themes were right;
    VX was not — its Shipped column read 19 against 20 items in the section, the drift left by
    VX22 and VX23 landing after the table was last touched. The UX row this page's design
    section flagged as 9/0/1 had already been corrected to 9/1/2 by Phase 1, so the only number
    changed here is VX's.

    **The `CR` code.** `## CR. Crucible` sits between UX and DR. UX11 and UX12 stay where they
    were written, because their IDs are cited in commits, in CI and in the CHANGELOG, and the
    new section points back at them; anything opened after the promotion that belongs to
    `apps/crucible` alone is numbered here instead. It opens with one item, `CR1` — the six
    mechanically translated languages, regenerated and read by someone who speaks each of
    them, which is the one item of [the promotion plan](../docs/crucible/design/promotion.md)'s Phase 6
    still open — so the new Overview row has something to count. The right-to-left half that
    note pairs with it is not open: the window took its `LayoutMirroring` root on 2026-09-05
    and two cases in `tst_shell.qml` hold it, so `CR1` says so and the note is corrected.

    **The links and the wrapper note** were already in, landed with Phase 1's path repointing
    on 2026-09-05: the two DR8 record links are absolute
    `https://github.com/.../blob/main/docs/...` URLs and `docs/roadmap.md` carries the rule
    for the next author. Re-checked here — all nine `](…)` hrefs in the file are absolute, so
    the exit condition holds.

    **What this week had made false**, corrected while reading the file: UX12 said the
    receiver's lock was not yet read off its display, which DR9's own row in the same file
    already contradicted, so the reading ("Atmos/DD+" at 7.1) now appears in both; the
    accessibility pass was listed as still open and landed 2026-09-05; and the 2026-09-06 work
    — the room and settings pages of the guide, and the tests over the tray, the Linux session
    monitor and the Linux silent device — was not in the entry at all.

    **What the review pass then found**, all of it claims the file made about itself. UX12 said
    the Linux package was not yet a release asset; the pre-tag section above already records
    that as settled - the leg uploads it as `packages-crucible-<preset>`, which is
    `release.yml`'s `packages-*` pattern - so the entry now says what the workflow does. DR9's
    one-line summary still read "PipeWire remain unconfirmed" against its own record's
    "PipeWire: confirmed 2026-09-05", and the re-wrap had joined its hard-wrapped `Windows/`
    and `WASAPI` with a space. Two theme headings overstated themselves: UX's said Forge,
    Crucible or the library while four of its items are the library's and two are shared, and
    IM's said both its tagged items land in the CLI when IM7 lands in the GUI's live room.

    Every summary that gained a tag was re-wrapped to the file's own 94-column measure, so the
    tags added no over-long line to a file that already had eight.

### Phase 6: packaging and release shape

**Status, 2026-09-30: partly built.** The `packages-crucible-<preset>` artifact and the
`ac3forge-crucible-*` packages exist, and `docs/releasing.md` has a row for each. The DEB packages
of the Crucible and Hearth components carry a description that names the member
(`CPACK_DEBIAN_CRUCIBLE_DESCRIPTION`, `CPACK_DEBIAN_HEARTH_DESCRIPTION`), in the extended text
only: no CPack setting changes the one-line synopsis, so `apt show` still opens with the library's,
as the fourth pre-tag fact above says. The `hearth` component is a fifth, packaged on every
Windows, macOS and Linux packaging leg and checked by `tools/ci/check_hearth_package.py`. No tag
has been cut since v0.10.0-beta.1 (2026-09-01), which has neither a Crucible nor a Hearth
package, so no release has collected either.

Depends on decisions 5, 6, 13 and 14. Under S1 nothing renames. Two of the three pre-tag facts
are in already: the artifact is `packages-crucible-<preset>` (`_build.yml:1652-1660`), and
docs/releasing.md's table (:571-581) carries a row for each Linux Crucible package, x86_64 and
aarch64, and one for the Windows zip. The third, one version-string style in
`cmake/Packaging.cmake:357-365`, was examined under decision 13 and refused, and the two styles
are documented instead. What is left for this phase is the `CPACK_COMPONENT_<C>_DESCRIPTION`
strings, which say which member each component is, for the generators that show them.

**Exit:** a release dry run produces `ac3forge-crucible-*` for Linux beside the Windows zip among
its collected artifacts, and each component's description names its member.

**Verified by:** `cpack --preset pack-windows-msvc` and
`python tools/ci/check_crucible_package.py packages/ac3forge-crucible-*.zip` locally; the
linux-llvm leg's Crucible pass in CI; a `release.yml` dry run (the way DR8 was verified); `tools/checks/check_packaging_versions.sh` green; `tools/release/bump_manifests.py` against the
dry run's assets finds both patterns it looks for.

### Phase 7: the driver, at signing time

**Status, 2026-10-01: done early, as change N1D, before the driver was ever signed.** On
2026-09-30 `Ac3ForgeNullSink.inx` still declared the device, its service and its speaker as
"Desktop Atmos" and the phase waited for the signing session. The owner then decided that the
driver could change at once, since it had never been signed and had been installed only in the
test guest, so nothing signed held its names and no installed copy would be orphaned. The change
renamed the identity as well as the strings (the plan below keeps the ids): `Ac3ForgeNullSink` is
`IclForgeNullSink` (hardware id, service, files, scripts, artifact), the device, service and
speaker declare "Crucible Silent Output", the INF's provider and manufacturer read "ICL Forge",
and the endpoint-match string is one constant, `kWindowsSilentDeviceName`. The endpoint is
"Speakers (Crucible Silent Output)" and not "Speakers (Crucible)": the Output page's first station
carries the endpoint's name beside the application's own station, "2 · CRUCIBLE". The renamed
driver was built, Code-Analysed and run under Driver Verifier in the guest, and the
`windows-driver` job was run on the branch. Not done: attestation, which is still to be submitted
once, and the move of the driver under `apps/crucible/`, which was not taken. [The driver's
page](../docs/platforms/windows-driver-acx.md#the-rename-2026-10-01) has the record.

Sequenced by [the promotion plan](../docs/crucible/design/promotion.md#coordination-with-the-driver-signing-session),
and by decision 14. In one change after the signing session lands: the four INF strings
(`Ac3ForgeNullSink.inx:97-102`) and the `.rc` description to Crucible; `null_sink_substring` and
its tests and fakes; the About licence line; the `windows-driver` artifact name;
`apps/crucible/windows/README.md`; and, if chosen, the move to `apps/crucible/driver` with
`apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt:372-376`, the `windows-driver` job and `driver-vm`'s paths. Then
attestation is submitted once.

**Exit:** the endpoint in a user's sound settings reads "Speakers (Crucible)" and the application
finds it; "Desktop Atmos" survives only in records.

**Verified by:** the `windows-driver` job builds and Code-Analyses the driver;
`apps/crucible/windows/driver-vm/Test-Driver.ps1` in the guest; `Deploy-Desk.ps1` pushes the built
`ac3crucible` and the signal path renders with the renamed device; `ctest -L crucible` with the
updated fakes.

### Later, outside this plan

The 1.0 questions: whether the binaries take Forge-branded names, whether the library's
identifiers give up the word, whether members get their own tag streams. Each is a breaking
change somewhere users have typed a name, and each is cheaper to take once, at the ABI freeze,
than twice.

The first two were taken early, between 2026-09-25 and 2026-09-29, before 1.0: the binaries take
the members' names and the family gives up `ac3forge` for `iclforge` (see the status block).
Whether members get their own tag streams has not been asked; decision 15 stands.

## What cannot be verified, and why

| Claim | Can it be verified | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| No user script calls `ac3cli` or `ac3gui` by name | **no** | no telemetry; the reason the binaries keep their names |
| `forge` and `crucible` are free on PyPI, npm, crates.io, Homebrew, Debian and Fedora | yes, by hand per registry | outside the tree; only needed under S2 |
| No external page links to `…/ac3forge/cli/` or `…/gui/` | **no** | no analytics on Pages; the reason the docs directories stay |
| The winget and vcpkg submissions survive a naming change | yes, by reading the open upstream PRs | outside the tree |
| The GUI's settings store is unaffected by Phase 4 | yes | a manual run on Windows and Linux; the QML tests isolate to a temporary INI and cannot see the native store |

The first row was the reason the binaries were to keep their names; the user decided to rename
them regardless, without a kept-working period. The second row's check was made again for N1:
`forge` is taken on PyPI, npm, crates.io and Homebrew core, and `iclforge` is free (PyPI, npm and
crates.io returned 404 for it on 2026-09-30).

## Coordination

**The driver-signing session.** `apps/crucible/windows/driver/` is being worked in a separate session.
Nothing in Phases 1 to 6 touches it, `Ac3ForgeNullSink`, or the "Desktop Atmos" endpoint string;
Phase 7 is that work landing plus one coordinated change.

**Open pull requests.** A tree-wide edit (Phase 1's `AC3DESK_*` fold, Phase 4's strings) lands
in one short-lived PR with the queue drained, the way UX12's Phase 1 did; check `gh pr list`
first. Phases 2, 3 and 5 are docs-heavy and can ride beside code PRs. N1 is now the tree-wide
edit, and the AC-4 plan places it in one quiet window after the current wave of phase branches
has merged.

**The docs-only fast path.** A PR that touches only `docs/`, `*.md` and `mkdocs.yml` runs the docs
strict build and skips the matrix (`ci.yml:314`). Phase 3 should stay inside that set; the moment
it touches a `.cmake` or a `.qml` it pays for eleven legs. Today the gate's planner makes that
decision, as the CI note above says.

## Deliberately not in scope

*Several of these were overtaken: renaming the binaries, the package tokens and the library's
identifiers is decided (see the status block), moving `libs/ac3` is proposed by N1B, and pages
under `docs/` moved on 2026-09-14 (#674). The bullets are kept as the record of what this page
decided on 2026-09-05.*

- **A repository, site or umbrella rename.** GitHub redirects git and web URLs; the Pages URL,
  the PyPI trusted publisher, the tap name and every verify snippet key on the literal name.
- **Renaming the library's identifiers** (`ac3::forge`, `find_package(ac3forge)`, `ac3forge_c`,
  `libac3forge`, the `AC3FORGE_` prefix). A 1.0 question at the earliest.
- **Renaming the binaries** or any package token, registry identifier, installer name or ProgID.
- **Per-member tag prefixes** or version lines.
- **Exporting `libs/audio`** or splitting `ac3tests` per member.
- **Moving `apps/forge/cli/src`, `apps/forge/gui`, `apps/shared/media/src`, `libs/ac3`, `apps/demos/android`, `apps/demos/wasm`,
  `js/`, `python/` or `rust/`** on disk.
- **Moving any page under `docs/`**, including `docs/cli`, `docs/gui`, `platforms/wasm.md`,
  `platforms/windows-demo.md` and `platforms/windows-driver-acx.md`.
- **Changing the Android applicationId** or the GUI's and Crucible's QSettings organisation and
  application names.
- **Splitting or simplifying the roadmap.** Done 2026-09-17 — see [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) and
  [planning/roadmap-inventory.md](roadmap-inventory.md).
- **The driver's identity** before signing; the endpoint string after it.
- **A fourth member.** The Shield demo and the browser demos stay demos of the library. *Superseded
  2026-09-07 by [the player-appliance plan](player-appliance.md#which-member-it-belongs-to): Hearth
  is a fourth member. This bullet is kept rather than deleted, as the record of what this page
  itself decided.*

## Decisions

The open questions. Each carries the recommendation and the cost of taking it;
every one was taken as recommended on 2026-09-05, so the recommendation is the decision.

**Where they stand on 2026-09-30.** Overtaken by the naming decisions of 2026-09-25 to 2026-09-29
(status block): 2 (the library's identifiers are renamed with the family, before 1.0), 3 (the
family's spelling becomes `iclforge` and "ICL Forge"), 5 (package tokens follow the family name)
and 6 (the binaries are renamed). Overtaken by the layout study, which is a proposal: 7 (nothing
moves). Built as decided: 1, 4 (in part, see Phase 4), 8 (with the differences noted under
[The docs](#the-docs)), 9 (then superseded by the 2026-09-17 roadmap) and 13. Taken and built
differently: 11 (the WebAssembly pages sit under Platforms in the nav, not under Library). Taken
and not carried out: 10 (the Shield app's display name is still "Shield Atmos Demo" and its
`versionName` is still hardcoded) and 12 (Crucible has no bundle identifier yet). Unchanged: 15.
Decision 14 was carried out the next day, on 2026-10-01, as change N1D (Phase 7), with the ids
changed as well as the strings.

1. **What Forge covers.** (a) the CLI alone; (b) `ac3cli` + `ac3gui` + `apps/shared/media/src`; (c) the
   pair plus the bindings. **Recommend (b)**: it is the boundary the build, install rules,
   packaging and docs already draw. Cost: the word Forge also names the library's build
   identifiers until decision 2 is taken.
2. **The word "forge".** (a) keep every library identifier and write the rule once; (b) rename
   the library's identifiers; (c) another word for the tooling. **Recommend (a)** now, (b) only
   at the 1.0 freeze. Cost: one sentence on two index pages, and "AC3Forge Forge" is never written.
3. **Family spelling.** (a) `ac3forge` everywhere; (b) "AC3Forge" in prose and product names,
   `ac3forge` in identifiers; (c) "Ac3Forge". **Recommend (b)**. Cost: about ten display sites,
   `lupdate`, recaptured screenshots.
4. **The tooling's display strings.** (a) unchanged; (b) About heading, usage banner and
   `.desktop` `Comment` say Forge with the family beneath, everything keyed to a settings store or
   a registry stays; (c) everything says Forge. **Recommend (b)**. Cost: seven `.ts` files and the
   screenshots that show the About box.
5. **Package tokens.** (1) `ac3forge` prefix everywhere, as today; (2) per-member tokens.
   **Recommend (1)**. Cost: the member names live in display strings and docs only.
6. **Binary names.** Keep `ac3cli`, `ac3gui`, `ac3crucible` through 0.x. **Recommend keep**. Cost:
   Forge reaches no binary.
7. **Directory layout.** (a) nothing moves; (b) `apps/forge/{cli,gui,common}`; (c) top-level
   members. **Recommend (a)**. Cost: the tree does not state the family; the README and the
   configure summary do.
8. **Docs.** (a) nav only, tables stay on the landing page; (b) nav only, tables to
   `docs/library/capabilities.md` with three anchors repointed; (c) move directories with stubs.
   **Recommend (b)**. Cost: one new page and three anchor edits.
9. **Roadmap.** (a) themes plus Member column, tags, recount and a `CR` code; (b) reorder per
   member; (c) three files. **Recommend (a)**. Cost: about 35 tag edits.
10. **The Shield app.** (a) leave; (b) the library's Android demo, ids unchanged, display name
    changed later to drop the two marks; (c) a fourth member; (d) retire it. **Recommend (b)**.
    Cost: the launcher label on sideloaded devices, and the hardcoded `versionName` fixed with it.
11. **WASM.** (a) the npm package under Library > Bindings and the pages under Library > Live
    demos, nothing moved; (b) a Demos section. **Recommend (a)**. Cost: nav lines.
12. **Reverse-DNS root.** `com.iainchesworthlabs.*`, `com.ac3forge.*` or
    `io.github.iainchesworthlabs.*`. **Recommend `com.iainchesworthlabs.*`** and set Crucible's
    bundle identifier before promotion Phase 5. Cost: one line.
13. **Before the first Crucible tag.** The `packages-*` artifact name; `M.m.p` in every filename;
    the experimental claim reconciled. **Recommend all three now**. Cost: three edits and a table
    row.

    *Taken 2026-09-05, with one part refused on inspection.* The artifact is now
    `packages-crucible-<preset>`, which `release.yml` collects, and the experimental sentences
    in `docs/releasing.md` now say what `_build.yml` does: `windows-msvc-arm64` is experimental
    and ships. The filename unification was examined and **not** made. Two archives carry
    `PROJECT_VERSION_FULL` (`crucible`, `dev`) and the runtime carries `M.m.p`, and neither can
    take the other's style: the runtime's is what the Homebrew cask's URL is built from
    (`packaging/homebrew/Casks/iclforge.rb` downloads `ac3forge-<M.m.p>-Darwin.dmg`), while
    dropping the prerelease suffix from the other two would make `0.10.0-beta.1` and
    `0.10.0-beta.2` produce the same filename. The two styles are therefore deliberate, and
    this page is where that is written down.
14. **The driver at signing time.** Strings, artifact name and substring only, ids kept; the move
    optional and in the same change. **Recommend that**. Cost: the endpoint name is frozen once
    attestation is paid for, so this lands first and once.
15. **One tag stream** or per-member tags. **Recommend one**. Cost: Crucible's first release
    carries the family's version number.
