# 7.1.4 in real time on the ESP32-S3 player

**Status, 2026-09-30:** built and merged in PRs #654 and #657 (2026-09-11 and 2026-09-12), with
two later changes to the decoder that touch it (decision 4). `714-walk.ec3` and `714-tones.ec3`
play at 2.0 over WiFi on the ESP32-S3 with no block reaching an empty queue. Streams using AHT or
enhanced coupling stay over the frame on this part ([What stays out of
reach](#what-stays-out-of-reach)). The figures below were taken on 2026-09-11 on a board, and
have not been taken again since F and G reached `main` or since #717 changed AHT's buffers.

What each decision came to:

| # | Decision | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Where the fold, the render and the sink run | An output task on core 0 was built and measured, and withdrawn (12): it did not pay. The fold stays in the decoder, and the render and the sink stay in the decode task |
| 2 | The ring's and the DMA queue's depth | Not built, since it belonged to the output task. `sdkconfig.psram` keeps a 64 ms queue, twelve descriptors of 256 frames |
| 3 | The data cache | Not changed: it stays at the default 32 KB, and `sdkconfig.psram` has no line for it |
| 4 | F and G in the decoder | Built. #656 was closed, and its two commits reached `main` by a direct merge (`cd11374d0`, 2026-09-12). #717 (2026-09-16) later decoded AHT straight into the block store, which removed G's per-stream buffers |
| 5 | Two cores inside the decode (B) | Not built; recorded with the stage shares |
| 6 | Twelve 32-bit slots on the S3 | (a) built in #657. The `tdm` sink is gone since #666 (2026-09-12): the `i2s` sink plans standard I2S or TDM for each layout, refuses a layout wider than its ceiling, and takes a second line for sixteen 16-bit slots, which has run into no DAC |
| 7 | The output stage's own speed (C) | #654 (2026-09-11) |
| 8 | The local-source shape | Measured, as decision 15 records |
| 9 | Stage timers in the example | Built in #657: `AC3FORGE_STAGE_TIMERS` |
| 10 | A 7.1.4 fold row in the probe | Built in #654: `eac3_714_fold` |
| 11 | The component's sources at `-O2` | Built in #657 |
| 12 | Withdraw the output task | Taken and built in #657. The block ring stays, inside `UnitHold` |
| 13 | A 32 KB instruction cache | Built: `sdkconfig.psram` |
| 14 | Hold a play's first unit | Built: `PlayerConfig::hold_first_unit`, on in `sdkconfig.psram` and `sdkconfig.ci` |
| 15 | The local shape's DMA queue | Built: the Kconfig help and the README say twelve descriptors, and the default stays four |

The user took the decisions on 2026-09-11: the component's side (decisions 1, 2, 6, 9 and 11) to
be built, F and G to be proposed for the decoder core now, and the probe row (decision 10) left
to PR #654, which profiles the fold. Decision 1 was built as (c) rather than (a), because of #654
(see decision 1). On the board, decision 1's output task did not pay, and two things the profile
had not tried did: a 32 KB instruction cache, and holding a play's first unit until its second is
decoded. With both, and #654, `714-walk.ec3` and `714-tones.ec3` play at 2.0 over WiFi with no
block reaching an empty queue ([the decisions on the board](#the-decisions-on-the-board)).
Decisions 12 to 15 follow from that, and the user took the recommendation on each the same day:
the output task withdrawn, the 32 KB instruction cache in `sdkconfig.psram`, the first unit held
by the player, and the local shape's queue documented.

When this page was written the player decoded a 7.1.4 E-AC-3 stream on the ESP32-S3 with every
slot at the host decoder's level, and over WiFi it did so too slowly. Folded to 2.0, a frame of
`714-walk.ec3` took 36 ms of its 32, and 149 of the stream's 900 blocks reached an empty DMA
queue ([the stream set on a board](esp32-stream-set.md#on-a-board)). This page records where that
frame's time goes, stage by stage, measured on the board. It then lists the options with what
each is expected to save, and the decisions, each with a recommendation and a cost.

## What was asked

- 7.1.4 E-AC-3 in real time on the streaming player: folded to 2.0, onto twelve slots, over WiFi
  and from a local source. Where that cannot be done, measurements that show what stands in the
  way.
- The whole path: the decode, the Annex E coding tools, the output stage, the render, the sink,
  where memory is placed, and the second core.
- Two constraints. Changes in `libs/ac3` need the user's agreement, and are coordinated with the
  other work in progress there. The gold standard (the host's double-precision decode, and the hashes
  and levels held to it) and the other platforms must not change.

## How it was measured

The board is the second ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 (N16R8) at 240 MHz, with no DAC. The I2S peripheral
clocks out regardless, so pacing and the sink's counters are real. The network shape is
`sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.hw;sdkconfig.psram`, which sends allocations of 16 KB and over to
PSRAM, with `AC3FORGE_MINIMAL_HOT_O2` on and each shape in a fresh build directory. The streams
are [the stream set](esp32-stream-set.md), served from a PC on the LAN, and each play was started
by `POST /play`.

The instruments were applied to a throwaway worktree and not committed:

- **The library's stage timers** (`AC3FORGE_STAGE_TIMERS`), routed to
  `firmware/baremetal/stage_timers.cpp` linked into the example, reset as each play starts and
  reported as it ends. An enter/leave pair costs 2.36 µs and a 7.1.4 frame opens about 160 pairs,
  so every stage-timed figure below includes about 0.4 ms of timer.
- **ESP-IDF's heap hooks** (`CONFIG_HEAP_USE_HOOKS`), counting the decode task's allocations by
  size, and by where each landed: internal RAM or PSRAM.
- **FreeRTOS run-time statistics per task** over each play, which give each core's idle time.
- **The least internal heap during a play**
  (`heap_caps_monitor_local_minimum_free_size_start`/`_stop`).
- **The twelve-slot conversion** (`ac3forge::interleave_24in32`), timed per block inside the null
  sink.

The bare-metal probe (`firmware/baremetal/platform/esp32s3`) was stage-timed on the same board. It
gained a scratch `eac3_714_fold` row: the probe's 7.1.4 fixture folded to Lo/Ro in line mode, with
reference levels 62,837 and 61,994 from `ac3cli decode ... downmix=loro drcmode=line`. The board
matched both.

## The frame on the board

All figures are per 32 ms frame, in microseconds.

### The decoder alone, in internal RAM

The probe runs with no network and no PSRAM, and every allocation in internal SRAM. Its 7.1.4
fixture is 640 kbit/s with coupling, spectral extension and AHT. Its three substreams decode
fourteen channels (6 + 4 + 4) into twelve, because the first dependent's surrounds replace the
bed's.

| Stage | `eac3_714`, as coded | `eac3_714_fold`, to Lo/Ro |
|---|---|---|
| Parse: exponents, bit allocation, mantissas (AHT's inverse apart) | 5,543 | 5,532 |
| AHT: all six blocks dequantised and inverted at block 0 | 7,968 | 7,979 |
| Spectral extension | 3,935 | 3,939 |
| IMDCT and overlap-add, 84 transforms | 8,160 | 8,161 |
| The rest of the three substream decodes | 2,799 | 2,782 |
| The access unit: split, identity keys, queue, assembly | 938 | 977 |
| The output stage: the fold and dialnorm | | 4,034 |
| **Frame** | **29,385** | **33,444** |
| Peak heap, bytes | 230,798 | 280,214 |

The probe's 5.1 fixture folds in 3,180 µs (`eac3_fold`). Both folds work out at about 18 cycles
for each sample the output stage zeroes, multiplies and adds, or copies. The stage makes six
passes over the frame, and `libs/ac3/src/decoder/output.cpp` was compiled at `-Os`: it was not on
`libs/ac3/minimal.cmake`'s `AC3FORGE_MINIMAL_HOT_O2` list (#654 put it there). Folding the whole
frame at once is also what raised the peak by 49 KB: six seats and two outputs of 1,536 samples
each; the stage works a block at a time now.

### In the player over WiFi, folded to 2.0

The I2S sink, a 64 ms DMA queue, line-mode DRC and dialnorm; stage-timed.

| | `714-walk` | `714-tones` | `layout-714` | `layout-51` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Parse | 8,047 | 7,728 | 9,656 | 3,566 |
| Spectral extension | 5,045 | 4,993 | | |
| IMDCT and overlap-add | 10,974 | 10,933 | 10,942 | 4,306 |
| The rest of the substream decodes | 4,482 | 4,477 | 4,509 | 1,226 |
| The access unit | 1,130 | 1,138 | 1,146 | 645 |
| The output stage | 7,854 | 8,022 | 7,817 | 5,137 |
| Render and sink write, with no wait | 1,601 | 1,579 | 1,543 | waits for the DAC |
| **Frame** | **39,225** | **38,979** | **35,741** | paced |
| Blocks to an empty queue | 149 of 900 | 62 of 378 | 27 of 192 | 0 of 192 |
| Least internal heap during the play, bytes | 2,755 | 2,939 | 7,611 | 10,167 |
| The decoder's allocations placed in PSRAM, per frame | 48 KB | 50 KB | 58 KB | 11 KB |
| Core 0 idle | 77% | 78% | 77% | 85% |
| Core 1 idle | 0.1% | 0.4% | 1.2% | 43% |

`714-walk` and `714-tones` use spectral extension; `layout-714` uses no coding tools. These
streams carry dialnorm −31, which normalises by a gain of exactly 1, so the output stage is
skipping that multiply and its time here is the fold's. Line-mode DRC is applied to each block's
coefficients inside the substream decode. Its share of that stage is not separated here: the
substream decode at 2.0 is 1.2 ms longer than in the as-coded image, and placement and DRC are
both in that difference. PR #654 profiles the fold, DRC and dialnorm, and separates them.

### In the player over WiFi, onto twelve slots, by coding tool

The null sink, levels as coded, objects as their bed. Nothing paces this sink, so a frame is the
decode, the render onto 7.1.4 and the example's level meter; stage-timed.

| Stream | Frame | IMDCT and overlap-add | Spectral extension | AHT | Enhanced coupling | Render and meter | Least internal heap | PSRAM per frame |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `layout-714` (no tools) | 28,859 | 10,419 | | | | 4,348 | 4,023 | 25 KB |
| `714-none` (block switching) | 30,276 | 10,333 | | | | 4,434 | 5,275 | 26 KB |
| `714-walk` | 32,910 | 10,611 | 4,995 | | | 4,289 | 5,459 | 25 KB |
| `714-tones` | 32,597 | 10,626 | 5,005 | | | 4,430 | 5,431 | 25 KB |

| `714-tpn` | 33,833 | 11,105 | | | | 5,066 | 5,091 | 46 KB |
| `714-cpl` | 35,036 | 10,473 | | | | 4,455 | 5,451 | 29 KB |
| `714-aht` | 38,876 | 10,741 | | 11,825 | | 4,259 | 4,291 | 32 KB |
| `714-all` (coupling, spectral extension, AHT) | 42,615 | 10,777 | 4,616 | 9,246 | | 4,668 | 4,607 | 34 KB |
| `714-ecpl` | 63,288 | 11,852 | | | 31,330 | 4,409 | 1,731 | 39 KB |

Core 0 was 69 to 82% idle in every play. A TDM sink adds the conversion to 32-bit slots on top:
396 µs per 256-sample block for twelve slots, 2.4 ms a frame, measured on the board.

### What the network shape leaves the decoder

At the start of each play the board had 161 to 169 KB of internal RAM free, and the largest block
was 86 to 94 KB. During a 7.1.4 play the least free fell to 2.6 to 5.5 KB, and to 1.7 KB with
enhanced coupling.

The decoder allocates each channel's 1,536 samples every frame (6,144 bytes; fourteen of them for
these streams) and frees them when the unit has been delivered. An allocation under 16 KB goes to
internal RAM while there is room and to PSRAM when there is not. So where a frame's buffers land
depends on what WiFi, the ring, the DMA queue and the fold hold at that moment. At 2.0, about
48 KB of each frame's allocations landed in PSRAM; onto twelve slots, 25 KB.

The cost shows in the stages that write or read those buffers. The probe's internal-RAM decode is
the comparison, since its fixture also decodes fourteen channels:

- the IMDCT and overlap-add took 30% longer in the network shape (10.6 to 11.0 ms, against 8.2);
- the rest of the substream decodes took 3.2 to 4.5 ms, against 2.8;
- the output stage took twice as long (7.8 to 8.0 ms, against 4.0).

### The second core

Core 0 runs WiFi, TCP/IP, the fetch task and the control surface, and in every play it was 69 to
85% idle. WiFi took 6 to 9% of the wall clock, TCP/IP 4 to 6%, and every other task under 1%.
That leaves about 22 to 26 ms of each 32 ms frame unused on core 0. Core 1 meanwhile runs the
decode, the output stage, the render, the meter and the sink's conversion. Once the decode falls
behind, core 1 never waits, which is why the task watchdog reported `IDLE1`.

### A local source

The partition source, with no network and no PSRAM (`sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.hw`), and
`714-tones.ec3` flashed as the partition's stream:

- **Folded to 2.0, it aborts at the first unit.** 6,144 bytes were asked for with 7,536 free and
  no block larger than 5,376, from 329,868 free at the start. The fold's frame-sized scratch (the
  49 KB of peak the probe shows) does not fit beside the player's ring and DMA queue.
- **Onto twelve slots through the `tdm` sink, it stops at `sink_open`**, as the next section
  explains.

### Twelve slots on this part

The ESP32-S3's I2S cannot carry twelve 32-bit slots on one data line. ESP-IDF v6.1 refuses the
configuration with "total slots(12) * slot_bit_width(32) exceeds the maximum 128". The limit is in
the register: `tx_half_sample_bits` is a 6-bit field, so a frame carries at most 128 bits, which is
four 32-bit slots or eight 16-bit ones. `tx_tdm_tot_chan_num` reaches sixteen slots only at 8 bits
each. ESP-IDF's HAL writes half the frame into that field for every TDM configuration
(`i2s_hal_tdm_set_tx_slot`), and the v6.1 I2S guide for the ESP32-S3 states the same limits: up to
sixteen slots, but four at 32 bits, eight at 16 and sixteen at 8. The v4.4 guide says "up to 16
channels" without the widths. The part has two I2S controllers, both with TDM, so between them at
most eight 32-bit slots or sixteen 16-bit slots.

The example's `tdm` sink says it carries up to sixteen slots, and its own comment says it has
never run on hardware. CI's TDM shapes (eight slots in `sdkconfig.ci-tdm`, twelve in
`sdkconfig.ci-render` and `sdkconfig.ci-http714`) all use the `capture` sink, which converts and
checks the samples without configuring a peripheral, so nothing had reached the limit before.
Eight 32-bit slots are 256 bits, which is over the limit too. On the
board, `sink_open` fails and the play ends with `result=fail`. With no progress lines configured,
the console says so in the first second after boot and prints nothing afterwards. That read as a
hang until a boot pause let the capture see the first second.

So on this part, 7.1.4 onto twelve slots means decoding and rendering twelve slots inside the
frame and handing them to a sink that can take them. That sink could be sixteen 16-bit slots
across both I2S controllers, or a TDM device that accepts several I2S lines. The example has
neither today.

**As built.** The first of the two exists since PR #666 (2026-09-12). The `tdm` sink is gone: the
`i2s` sink opens standard I2S for one or two channels and TDM from three, sized by
`sink_plan.hpp`, and with `CONFIG_AC3FORGE_EXAMPLE_I2S_SECOND_LINE` it drives the second I2S
controller as a slave of the first, for eight 32-bit or sixteen 16-bit slots. A layout wider than
that ceiling is refused when it is set (`accept_layout` in `hearth_sink.cpp`), which is decision 6's
check. Nothing has run the two lines into DACs.

### The data cache

The 2.0 image, again, with a 64 KB data cache and 64-byte lines (`ESP32S3_DATA_CACHE_64KB`,
`ESP32S3_DATA_CACHE_LINE_64B`):

| | 32 KB, 32-byte lines | 64 KB, 64-byte lines |
|---|---|---|
| `714-walk` frame | 39,225 | 37,271 |
| `714-tones` frame | 38,979 | 36,776 |
| `layout-714` frame | 35,741 | 33,256 |
| The output stage, `714-walk` | 7,854 | 5,973 |
| Blocks to an empty queue: walk, tones, `layout-714` | 149, 62, 27 | 149, 62, 4 |
| The decoder's allocations in PSRAM per frame, `714-walk` | 48 KB | 65 KB |

That is about 2 ms a frame, most of it in the output stage, for 32 KB of internal SRAM taken from
the heap.

### The component's own sources at `-O2`

The project builds at `-Os`, so the player, the renderer, the level meter and the conversion run at
`-Os` while the decoder's hot sources run at `-O2`. The null image again, with the conversion to
twelve 32-bit slots running in the sink, before and after compiling `player.cpp` and the example's
sources at `-O2`:

| `714-walk` onto twelve slots | `-Os` | `-O2` |
|---|---|---|
| Render | 2,578 | 2,029 |
| Meter, conversion and sink | 4,390 | 3,402 |
| The conversion alone, per 256-sample block | 398 | 336 |
| Everything after the decode (`eac3_au_emit`) | 7,020 | 5,482 |
| Frame | 35,902 | 34,193 |

`layout-714` and `714-tones` moved the same way (emit 7,510 to 6,098 µs, and 7,186 to 5,859).
The application image grew by 4,400 bytes of flash, and SRAM is unchanged.

## What the profile says

This is the reading of 2026-09-11, before #654 and #657. Once #654 folded a block at a time the
7.1.4 fold took 1.12 ms in the probe where it took 4.06, and a `714-walk` frame at 2.0 over WiFi
took 30.0 ms where it took 35.3. The output task of the third cause was built and withdrawn, and
the instruction cache of the fourth is in `sdkconfig.psram`
([the decisions on the board](#the-decisions-on-the-board)).

Three things push a 7.1.4 frame past 32 ms in the network shape, and their costs add:

1. **The output stage at 2.0** takes 7.9 ms on the decode's core, twice its internal-RAM cost.
2. **Internal RAM runs out.** WiFi, the ring, the DMA queue and the frame-sized fold leave the
   decoder too little room. Its per-frame buffers land partly in PSRAM, and the stages that touch
   them slow by 3 to 4 ms.
3. **Everything after the decode shares its core.** The output stage, the render, the meter and
   the sink's conversion run on core 1 after the decode: 9.5 ms at 2.0, and 6.7 ms onto twelve
   slots with a TDM conversion. Core 0 meanwhile is three quarters idle.

With those three dealt with, what remains is the decode itself. That is 27 to 28 ms a frame over
WiFi for a 7.1.4 stream without AHT or enhanced coupling, and about 21 ms in internal RAM. With AHT
the decode alone takes 33 ms. With coupling, spectral extension and AHT together it takes 37 ms,
and with enhanced coupling 58 ms. Those do not fit on one core, whatever happens on the output
side.

The board runs of the decisions found a fourth: the 16 KB instruction cache. The stage times could
not show it, since each stage's cache misses are part of that stage's time ([why the second core
did not help](#why-the-second-core-did-not-help)).

## Options, by expected saving

Each saving is per frame on core 1, the decode's core, for `714-walk` over WiFi unless the row
says otherwise. Where a row says "estimate", the saving is worked out from the stages above rather
than measured.

| | Option | Where | Expected saving | From |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | An output task on core 0, fed by a ring of decoded blocks in PSRAM. The fold, the render, the meter and the sink leave the decode's core | the component | 2.0: 9.5 ms, less about 1 ms of copying (estimate). Twelve slots: 4.3 ms, or 6.7 ms with a TDM conversion, less the copy | measured stages |
| B | Two cores inside the decode: each substream's reconstruction (spectral extension, IMDCT) in parallel, and the parse kept in bitstream order | `libs/ac3` | 8 to 11 ms at 7.1.4 (estimate) | the stage shares above |
| C | The output stage's own cost: `-O2`, and one pass per block | `libs/ac3`, in #654 | up to about 6 of the 7.9 ms at 2.0 (estimate) | 18 cycles an element at `-Os` |
| D | The fold's scratch sized to a block rather than a frame. With A, that is 8 KB on the output task instead of 49 KB on the decoder | the component, with A | 1 to 1.5 ms of placement at 2.0 (estimate) | PSRAM per frame 48 KB at 2.0, against 25 KB with no fold |
| E | A 64 KB data cache with 64-byte lines | `sdkconfig.psram` | 2.0 ms at 2.0 | measured |
| F | Per-frame channel buffers kept by the decoder, where today they are allocated each frame | `libs/ac3` | up to 3 to 4 ms in the network shape (estimate), and fourteen fewer allocations a frame | network shape against probe |
| G | AHT's 43 KB frame buffer split into seven buffers, so it can stay in internal RAM, and a cheaper six-point inverse | `libs/ac3` | 2 to 5 ms when a stream uses AHT (estimate) | 9.2 to 11.8 ms on the board, against 8.0 in internal RAM |
| H | The component's sources at `-O2`: render, conversion, meter | the component | 1.5 ms onto twelve slots, less at 2.0; 4,400 bytes of flash | measured |
| I | A hand-written Xtensa FFT for the IMDCT, as esp-dsp does it | `libs/ac3` | about 2 ms (estimate) | esp-dsp's published cycle counts |
| J | The dependent substreams decoded by a second `Eac3Decoder` on core 0 | the component | as B | |
| K | A 32 KB instruction cache | `sdkconfig.psram` | 3.1 ms of a 2.0 frame's decode, 3.8 ms of a twelve-slot frame | measured, [on the board](#the-decisions-on-the-board) |
| L | A play's first unit held until the second is decoded | the component | the underruns in a play's first frames | measured, on the board |

I and J are listed so they can be ruled out. I adds a kernel tier built on fused multiply-adds,
which round differently from the scalar reference the tiers are held to. J gives the dependents a
dither sequence of their own. The decoder draws dither for every substream from one generator
(`Eac3Decoder::Impl::dither_`) during the parse, so their noise would differ from the host
decode's, and the levels would stop matching the host's to the digit. J would also duplicate
§E3.8.2's assembly in the component.

## Decisions

1. **Where the fold, the render and the sink run.**
   - (a) **An output task on core 0**, fed by a ring of decoded blocks in PSRAM. The decode task
     decodes, and copies each block's channels into the ring. The output task folds with the
     library's own `OutputStage` a block at a time, then renders and writes to the sink.
   - (b) As now: all of it inside the decode call on core 1.
   - (c) The decoder keeps the fold, and the output task takes the render and the sink.

   **Recommend (a).** It moves 9.5 ms of a 2.0 frame, and 6.7 ms of a twelve-slot TDM frame, to
   the core that has 22 to 26 ms idle. Folding a block at a time needs 8 KB, where the decoder's
   frame fold holds 49 KB of internal RAM. The fold stays the same code with the same arithmetic.
   The decoder is asked for its output as coded, with line mode's DRC: `drc_scale` 1, which is
   what line mode resolves to. `OutputStage` then folds each block with the unit's layout, mixing
   levels and dialnorm. For Lo/Ro, Lt/Rt and mono in line or custom mode, folding a block at a
   time gives the same samples as folding a frame at a time. RF mode's limiter ramps across
   whatever it is handed, so in RF mode the output task folds a whole unit at once. (c) leaves the
   largest item on core 1.

   Cost:
   - a third task, with a 6 to 8 KB stack from internal RAM;
   - a ring in PSRAM, 192 KB at sixteen blocks of twelve channels, and more with objects;
   - copying each block out of the decoder's storage, about 72 KB a frame at 7.1.4 and an
     estimated 0.5 to 1.4 ms on core 1;
   - about 300 lines in the component;
   - the player, not the decoder, calls the fold, so a change to the fold's semantics has two
     callers to keep in step;
   - latency grows by the ring's depth.

   Host tests would cover the ring's index arithmetic, and a 7.1.4 stream decoded both ways (the
   decoder's own fold, and as coded then `OutputStage` per block) to identical samples.

   **Taken 2026-09-11, and built as (c) for now.** PR #654, which profiles the fold, opened
   the same day, held for the user's OK. It makes `OutputStage` work in 256-sample blocks, bit-exact
   in every tier, and puts `output.cpp` on the `-O2` list. On the board the 7.1.4 fold's own time
   fell from 4.06 to 1.12 ms, its 43 KB of frame-long scratch went, and `714-walk` at 2.0 over WiFi
   fell from 35.3 to 30.0 ms a frame. With the fold that cheap, moving it to core 0 would save
   about 2 ms and cost the 72 KB-a-frame copy and a second caller of the fold. So the fold stays in
   the decoder, the ring carries the decoder's blocks as they come (the fold's two channels at
   2.0), and the output task renders and writes them. If #654 does not land, (a)'s player-side
   fold is the next step.

   **Measured 2026-09-11: it did not pay.** At 2.0 the decode task took as long with the output
   task as without it, and onto twelve slots 1.8 to 3.2 ms a frame longer ([why the second core did
   not help](#why-the-second-core-did-not-help)). Decision 12 asks whether to withdraw it.

2. **How deep the ring and the DMA queue are.**
   - (a) **A sixteen-block ring (85 ms) in PSRAM, and a 21 ms DMA queue at 2.0**: eight
     descriptors of 128 frames, 8 KB of internal RAM.
   - (b) An eight-block ring, with the DMA queue at 64 ms as now.
   - (c) A thirty-two-block ring.

   **Recommend (a).** The worst frames measured were 50 to 72 ms, against averages of 28 to 39,
   so the ring has to hold a frame's excess over 32 ms and then some. With the ring absorbing the
   decoder's bursts, the DMA queue only has to cover the output task being held off by WiFi, and
   21 ms of it returns 16 KB of internal RAM to the decoder. Cost: 85 ms of latency against
   today's 64 ms queue. These depths are reasoned from the profile, and the board run has to
   confirm them.

   **Measured:** with the output task, the underruns at 2.0 were those of the 64 ms queue without
   it. Decision 12 would take the queue back to 64 ms, which decision 14's held unit relies on.

3. **The data cache.**
   - (a) **Decide once decision 1 has been measured.**
   - (b) A 64 KB cache with 64-byte lines in `sdkconfig.psram` now.
   - (c) Keep 32 KB.

   **Recommend (a).** Most of the 2 ms came from the output stage, which decision 1 moves to
   core 0 and shrinks. The 32 KB the cache costs comes out of the internal RAM the decoder is
   short of. Cost: one more board run.

   **Measured, and now recommend (c).** With #654 the data cache takes 0.4 ms off a 2.0 frame, and
   beside decision 13's instruction cache it leaves too little internal SRAM for a 2.0 play over
   WiFi ([the data cache, again](#the-data-cache-again)).

4. **Small changes to ask of the decoder core.**
   - (a) **Once decisions 1 and 2 are on the board, propose G's AHT buffer split and F's kept
     channel buffers**, each with footprint figures for every target.
   - (b) Propose them now.
   - (c) Neither.

   **Recommend (a).** Decisions 1 and 2 are expected to bring `714-walk` and `714-tones` to about
   28 ms a frame on core 1. That is real time with a margin of about 10%. F and G widen that
   margin, and bring the 7.1.4 streams that use AHT closer, but a board figure should say how much
   is still needed before `libs/ac3` changes. Cost of F and G: each needs the user's agreement.
   Each must leave the double build's arithmetic textually untouched and must not
   raise the probe's peak heap on any target. F keeps up to 84 KB of channel buffers between
   frames that today are freed between frames, so its peak is unchanged but its low point rises.

   **Taken 2026-09-11 as (b):** the user asked for F and G to be proposed now, and they were
   proposed that day, with #654's changes to the same file as the reason to build them after it
   lands or on top of it. Nothing in `libs/ac3` changed before the user's answer.

   With decisions 13 and 14, `714-walk` and `714-tones` play without F or G. Both were built
   as #656, and the user had them measured on the board on 2026-09-11, each
   merged onto this branch with #654 (the tables are on #656):
   - G did not bring `714-aht` inside the frame: 33.2 ms onto twelve slots and 35.2 at 2.0. At 2.0
     over WiFi it made `714-aht` and `714-all` 1.7 ms slower, likely because its 6 KB blocks fall
     under `sdkconfig.psram`'s 16 KB always-internal threshold, where the one 43 KB block went to
     PSRAM.
   - F took 1.0 to 1.4 ms a frame off `714-walk` and `714-tones` at 2.0, and 0.7 to 1.0 ms onto
     twelve slots. WiFi was unaffected in ten plays, but the least free internal heap during a
     7.1.4 play at 2.0 fell to 703 to 895 bytes, against 975 to 2,419 without it.

   **As built.** #656 was closed without merging, and its two commits, G (`a627732a1`) and F
   (`07699f2f7`), reached `main` by a direct merge of their branch, `cd11374d0`, on 2026-09-12. F
   is still in the decoder as `pcm_pool_`, a pooled set of channel buffers for each substream
   identity. G's per-stream AHT buffer is not: #717 (2026-09-16) has block 0 decode an AHT stream
   straight into the per-block coefficient store, so no AHT frame buffer exists. The times on
   this page are from before both changes; #717's description leaves it open whether it recovers
   the 1.7 ms G cost at 2.0 over WiFi.

5. **Two cores inside the decode (B).**
   - (a) **Record it with the stage shares, as the next step if 7.1.4 streams with AHT must
     play.**
   - (b) Propose it to the decoder core now.

   **Recommend (a).** It is the largest change on this page, and the output-side decisions come
   first. Cost of (b):
   - the substream decode split into a parse and a reconstruction, and the reconstruction able to
     run on another core;
   - the parse kept in bitstream order, so the shared dither generator hands out the values it
     hands out today, which keeps the output bit-identical;
   - a second copy of the per-substream scratch the decoder holds once today: `tails_`, the IMDCT
     scratch, and the AHT and enhanced-coupling buffers, about 50 KB;
   - a seam through which the caller supplies threads, in a library that has no RTOS.

6. **Twelve 32-bit slots on the S3.**
   - (a) **The `tdm` sink refuses a frame of more than 128 bits and says why; the Kconfig range
     and the README state what the part allows; and 7.1.4 onto twelve slots is shown on the
     `null` and `capture` sinks.**
   - (b) A sink across both I2S controllers at 16 bits, sixteen slots.
   - (c) Leave the sink as it is.

   **Recommend (a) now, and (b) once a TDM DAC is on the bench.** (c) leaves a sink that fails on
   every board as soon as it is asked for more than four 32-bit slots. Cost of (a): a check in
   `sink_open`, a narrower Kconfig range, and the sink's comment and README section rewritten.
   Cost of (b): two controllers kept in step on one clock, which cannot be verified without a DAC.

   **Built:** (a) in #657 and (b) in #666, as [Twelve slots on this part](#twelve-slots-on-this-part)
   says. (b) is still unverified against a DAC.

7. **The output stage's own speed (C).** This is not decided here. It is PR #654's, which
   profiles the fold, DRC and dialnorm.
   Decision 1 calls the same `OutputStage`, so whatever #654 changes reaches the player
   with no change here.

8. **The local-source shape.**
   - (a) **With decision 1 in place, play 7.1.4 to 2.0 again from the partition source without
     PSRAM, and record whether the block-sized fold fits.**
   - (b) Require PSRAM for 7.1.4 at 2.0.

   **Recommend (a).** Cost: one board run.

   **Measured:** with #654 the local 2.0 play fits, and plays without underruns once the DMA queue
   holds a whole frame ([a local source](#a-local-source)). Decision 15 asks how.

9. **Keeping the stage timers in the example.**
   - (a) **The example links the stage-timer backend and prints a play's stages when the library
     is built with `AC3FORGE_STAGE_TIMERS`, as the probe does.** The heap and task counters stay
     scratch.
   - (b) Keep all of it scratch.

   **Recommend (a).** The next question about where a player's frame goes then needs one build
   flag, where this one needed a patched worktree. Cost: a few lines of CMake and about twenty in
   `hearth_sink.cpp`. A plain build is unchanged, because nothing calls the backend and the
   linker drops it.

10. **A 7.1.4 fold row in the bare-metal probe.**
    - (a) **Add `eac3_714_fold`, in this branch or in #654, whichever commits first.**
    - (b) Leave the probe as it is.

    **Recommend (a).** It gates the 7.1.4 fold's peak heap on every leg. Cost: the probe's
    reported peak (`heap.peak_bytes`, the highest of any fixture) rises from the 7.1.4 row's
    230,798 to 280,214, against the ARM leg's ceiling of 300,000 (`AC3FORGE_MAX_HEAP_BYTES` in
    `tools/checks/run_baremetal_probe.sh`). The C3 leg skips the row by heap budget, as it skips
    the other 7.1.4 row. The generator's decode variant adds a levels array and no bitstream.

    **Taken 2026-09-11: left to #654**, which adds `eac3_714_fold` together with
    the block-wise fold, which brings the row's peak to 237,206.

11. **The component's own sources at `-O2` (H).**
    - (a) **Compile `player.cpp` and the example's sinks and meter at `-O2`**, as the decoder's hot
      sources already are.
    - (b) Leave them at `-Os`.

    **Recommend (a).** It saves 1.5 ms a frame onto twelve slots on whichever core runs the
    output side, for 4,400 bytes of flash and no SRAM. Cost: the component's CMake sets a
    per-source option, and a project that needs the flash back has to opt out, as
    `AC3FORGE_MINIMAL_HOT_O2` already allows for the decoder.

    **Measured:** the renderer is header-only (`include/ac3forge/render.hpp` then, since moved to
    `libs/render/include/iclforge/render/render.hpp`) and compiles into
    `player.cpp`, so it runs at `-O2` with it. Onto twelve slots the render took 2.1 to 2.7 ms a
    frame in the base image and 1.5 to 2.2 ms with `player.cpp` at `-O2` (#654 does not touch the
    render).

12. **The output task (decision 1, as built).**
    - (a) **Withdraw it.** The player renders and writes in the decode task again. The output
      task, its ring and its three Kconfig options go, and `sdkconfig.psram`'s DMA queue goes back
      to 64 ms.
    - (b) Keep it, off in every configuration.
    - (c) Keep it on in `sdkconfig.psram`.

    **Recommend (a).** On this part it saved nothing at 2.0 and cost 1.4 to 3.2 ms a frame onto
    twelve slots, and it is about 300 lines and a third task. (b) keeps code that nothing runs.
    Cost of (a): the commits that added it come out; the block ring and its host test stay only if
    decision 14 holds its unit in them.

    **Taken 2026-09-11.** The block ring and its host test stay: the held unit is kept in one.

13. **The instruction cache.**
    - (a) **32 KB in `sdkconfig.psram`** (`CONFIG_ESP32S3_INSTRUCTION_CACHE_32KB`).
    - (b) Keep the default, 16 KB.

    **Recommend (a).** It takes 3.1 ms off the decode of a 2.0 frame and 3.8 ms off a twelve-slot
    frame. With it, every 7.1.4 stream in the set without AHT or enhanced coupling fits onto twelve
    slots with 12 to 26% of the frame to spare. Cost: 16 KB of internal SRAM; the heap at a 2.0
    play's start went from 170,095 to 153,367 bytes. Builds without PSRAM keep 16 KB: their heap
    is shorter, and their decode has time to spare.

    **Taken 2026-09-11.**

14. **A play's start.**
    - (a) **The player holds a play's first unit until the second is decoded**, so the sink
      starts with two frames queued. A `PlayerConfig` option, off by default, and on in
      `sdkconfig.psram` and in `sdkconfig.ci` so that QEMU plays through it.
    - (b) A pre-roll in the I2S sink: the channel stopped as a play begins, its DMA preloaded, and
      then started again.
    - (c) Neither.

    **Recommend (a).** Measured on the scratch combination: no underruns in twelve plays of
    `714-walk` and `714-tones`, against 2 to 6 a play without it, and no change onto twelve slots.
    It works the same for every sink. (b) stops the I2S clocks between plays, and there is no DAC
    here to show what a DAC makes of that. (c) leaves gaps adding up to as much as 28 ms in a
    play's first third of a second. Cost of (a): 32 ms more before a play is heard; a buffer of one
    unit's channels for the first unit only, 12 KB at 2.0 and 72 KB at twelve slots, from PSRAM
    where there is PSRAM; about 60 lines in the player, and a host test of the order the held
    blocks come out in.

    **Taken 2026-09-11.**

15. **The local shape's DMA queue.**
    - (a) **The README and the Kconfig help say that a local 7.1.4 play folded to 2.0 needs twelve
      descriptors, and the default stays at four.**
    - (b) Twelve descriptors in `sdkconfig.defaults`.

    **Recommend (a).** (b) takes 16 KB of internal SRAM from every build without PSRAM, whatever
    it plays. Cost of (a): a paragraph in each.

    **Taken 2026-09-11.**

## The decisions on the board

The component's side was built as decided and played on the same board. Every image below has
PR #654 merged into this branch, except the first row of each table, which is this branch's base
(PR #649) with nothing added. All are the network shape, each built fresh, with no instruments.
A frame is `us_per_frame`, the decode task's time per 32 ms frame; once the decode is ahead of the
DAC it includes the wait for the DAC. Where the render and the sink run in the decode task, the
decode alone is that figure less `render_us_per_frame` and `sink_us_per_frame`, and it is given in
brackets. Underruns are the blocks that reached an empty DMA queue, and dry is how long the queue
had been empty, in all.

### Folded to 2.0 over WiFi

| Image | `714-walk` frame | Underruns, dry ms | `714-tones` frame | Underruns, dry ms | `layout-714` underruns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Before: #649 | 38,432 (36,910) | 149, 1,057 | 37,899 (36,365) | 62, 388 | 10 |
| #654, render and sink in the decode task, 64 ms DMA queue | 32,540 (30,728) | 27, 221 | 32,687 (30,483) | 9, 99 | 5 |
| #654 and the output task: sixteen blocks in PSRAM, 21 ms queue | 32,558 | 27, 243 | 32,326 | 12, 112 | 7 |
| The same, eight blocks in internal SRAM | 33,101 | 35, 300 | 33,040 | 12, 140 | 5 |
| The same, sixteen in PSRAM, 64 KB data cache | 31,963 | 24, 153 | 31,681 | 7, 75 | 5 |
| #654, no output task, 64 KB data cache | 32,133 (30,267) | 22, 135 | 32,450 (29,917) | 8, 88 | 5 |
| #654, no output task, lwIP's tcpip task pinned to core 0 | 32,423 (30,626) | 27, 186 | 32,473 (30,091) | 10, 92 | 5 |
| #654 and the output task, 32 KB instruction cache | 30,925 | 4, 12 | 30,566 | 2, 18 | 0 |
| #654, no output task, 32 KB instruction cache | 31,271 (27,560) | 2, 18 | 31,340 (27,357) | 4, 19 | 3 |
| The same, and a play's first unit held | 31,334 (27,508) | 0, 0 | 31,413 (27,123) | 0, 0 | 0 |

In the last row the decode is ahead, so each frame includes about 3 ms of waiting for the DAC.
`714-walk` was played seven times and `714-tones` five on that image, and no block reached an
empty queue in any of them; the least headroom as a block arrived was 4 to 5 ms. `layout-51`, the
demo, and the 7.1.4 streams without AHT or enhanced coupling had none either. The levels were the
same in every image, and they are the host's Lo/Ro levels to the digit: 36,190 and 36,190 for
`714-walk`, 129,016 and 128,870 for `714-tones` (`ac3cli decode ... downmix=loro drcmode=line`).

With the instruction cache at 32 KB and nothing held, every remaining underrun fell in a play's
first ten frames. A scratch print in the sink's queue model put each one on the first block of a
frame, at writes 6 to 60, and none later. A play's first frames decode more slowly than the rest,
and a play starts with one frame, 32 ms, queued. Holding the first unit until the second is
decoded starts the DAC with two frames queued, which is what the 64 ms queue holds.

The rest of the 7.1.4 set at 2.0 on the last image: `714-none`, `714-spx`, `714-cpl` and `714-tpn`
had no underruns. `714-aht` decodes in 33.9 ms and ran dry from its twelfth frame, `714-all` in
36.8 ms, and `714-ecpl` in 60.1 ms, dry from its third.

### Onto twelve slots over WiFi, by coding tool

The null sink, levels as coded, objects as their bed. Nothing paces this sink, so a frame is the
whole of it on the decode's core: the decode, and without the output task the render (1.5 to
2.2 ms) and the level meter (about 1.8 ms) too.

| Stream | Before: #649 | #654 | #654 and the output task | #654, 32 KB instruction cache | The same, 64 KB data cache | #654 and the output task, 32 KB instruction cache |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `layout-714` | 27,610 | 27,244 | 30,004 | 23,790 | 22,630 | 25,156 |
| `714-none` | 29,315 | 28,720 | 31,089 | 24,699 | 23,810 | 26,479 |
| `714-walk` | 31,402 | 30,834 | 33,982 | 27,041 | 26,253 | 28,928 |
| `714-tones` | 30,934 | 30,656 | 33,743 | 26,848 | 25,932 | 28,573 |
| `714-spx` | 32,685 | 32,411 | 35,607 | 28,210 | 27,155 | 29,658 |
| `714-tpn` | 32,034 | 31,877 | 34,423 | 27,638 | 26,411 | 29,912 |
| `714-cpl` | 32,579 | 32,591 | 35,663 | 28,230 | 27,454 | 30,006 |
| `714-aht` | 37,179 | 36,651 | 39,092 | 32,943 | 30,949 | 34,832 |
| `714-all` | 40,482 | 39,985 | 42,700 | 36,336 | 33,929 | 37,967 |
| `714-ecpl` | 62,629 | 61,395 | 63,206 | 55,932 | 50,298 | 59,958 |

Holding the first unit moved these by less than 0.6 ms (`714-walk` 27,262 with it). Every slot of
every play had the same level in every image. Three streams differ from `streams.json` in every
image, the base included: one slot of `714-tones` and the LFE of `714-none` by one in the last
digit, and `714-tpn` in every slot, because the player plays 15 of its 16 units ([the stream
set](esp32-stream-set.md)).

### A local source

The partition source with `714-tones.ec3`, no network and no PSRAM, four laps:

| | Before: #649 | #654, the default 21 ms queue | #654, a 64 ms queue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Folded to 2.0 | aborts at the first unit | 251 of 1,512 blocks to an empty queue | none of 1,512 |
| Onto twelve slots, null sink | not measured | 23.9 ms a frame | |

With #654 the fold no longer needs its frame-long scratch, so the local 2.0 play fits. Its decode
takes about 22.4 ms a frame, all of it in internal SRAM. The default queue, four descriptors of 256
frames, is shorter than the six blocks a frame arrives in: the decode waits in the sink for part of
every frame, and the queue runs dry before the next. Twelve descriptors hold a whole frame with
room to spare, for 16 KB more of internal SRAM; 18,752 bytes of internal heap were free at the end
of the second lap. Repeated plays without PSRAM can still fail on fragmentation rather
than on the total free: under QEMU on the same tree, a fifth play after boot stopped on the
decoder's frame-long channel buffers, 6,144 bytes asked for with the largest free block 5,632
([the player plan](esp32-player.md), hand-over item 5).

### Why the second core did not help

At 2.0 the decode task took as long with the output task as without it, and the underruns were the
same. Onto twelve slots it took 1.8 to 3.2 ms a frame longer, about what the render and the meter
it no longer ran had cost. With the ring in internal SRAM, 2.0 was worse.

The S3's two cores share one instruction cache, one data cache, and the SPI bus behind both to
flash and PSRAM. The decoder's code runs from flash through the instruction cache. What the output
task ran on core 0, the renderer, the meter and the I2S driver, took cache lines and bus time from
the decoder on core 1, and copying each block into the ring added traffic of its own: 72 KB a frame
onto twelve slots, written to PSRAM and read back. At 32 KB the instruction cache took 3.1 ms off
the decode of a 2.0 frame and 3.8 ms off a twelve-slot frame, and the output task's cost onto
twelve slots fell to 1.4 to 1.9 ms. The stage timers put each stage's cache misses inside that
stage, which is why the profile above could not show that a larger instruction cache would shorten
all of them.

Pinning lwIP's tcpip task, which can run on either core, to core 0 made no difference.

### The data cache, again

At 64 KB with 64-byte lines the data cache now takes 0.4 ms off a 2.0 frame: #654 took away most of
the fold's work, which is where it saved before. With the 32 KB instruction cache as well, the two
caches hold 48 KB of internal SRAM between them, and at 2.0 over WiFi the internal heap at a play's
start fell to 121 KB. Two 7.1.4 plays, each the first after a boot, aborted at the decoder's first
IMDCT, where FreeRTOS could not allocate the mutex that guards a function-local static; the plays
after them ran. Through the null sink, which has no I2S DMA queue, 150 KB was free, every play ran,
and the data cache took another 0.8 to 2 ms off each twelve-slot frame.

## What stays out of reach

Open on the S3, on the figures of 2026-09-11, which are from before F, G and #717 reached `main`.
The P4 decodes the same streams inside a frame in its probe: `714-aht` in 0.37, `714-all` in 0.40
and `714-ecpl` in 0.70 ([the sink tiers plan](esp32-sink-tiers.md#why-the-s3-is-better-but-not-best)).

- **Enhanced coupling at 7.1.4.** With decisions 13 and 14 it decodes in 60.1 ms at 2.0 and
  takes 55.9 ms onto twelve slots. Split across two cores (B) it would still be about half that
  before any output work. It does not fit on this part.
- **7.1.4 with AHT.** 33.9 ms at 2.0 and 32.9 ms onto twelve slots, 30.9 where the internal SRAM
  allows the 64 KB data cache as well. G, measured on the board, does not bring it in on its own:
  33.2 ms onto twelve slots and 35.2 at 2.0.
- **Coupling, spectral extension and AHT together.** 36.8 ms at 2.0 and 36.3 onto twelve slots.
  B and G together might bring it in.
- **Twelve 32-bit slots on one data line.** The I2S register does not allow it.

## Verification, for the implementation

- **On the board:**
  - `714-walk.ec3` and `714-tones.ec3` at 2.0 over WiFi, with no block reaching an empty queue
    and levels matching the host's Lo/Ro to the digit;
  - the stream set onto 7.1.4 through the null sink, with core 1 under 32 ms a frame and every
    slot at the host's level;
  - the per-tool table again;
  - the local shape.
- **In CI:** the ESP32 job's QEMU steps pass through whatever decisions 12 and 14 leave in the
  player. These are the `capture` sink at 2.0 and at twelve slots, the render shape, and the stream
  set over QEMU's Ethernet (`tools/checks/check_stream_set.py`). The host tests also run.

The board items were first measured with a scratch combination of this branch, #654, the 32 KB
instruction cache and the held unit ([the decisions on the board](#the-decisions-on-the-board)).
They were run again on 2026-09-11 on the branch as built after decisions 12 to 15, with #654
merged in and nothing else added:

- **2.0 over WiFi**, `sdkconfig.psram` as committed: `714-walk` played five times and `714-tones`
  four, with no block reaching an empty queue in any play, at 31.2 to 31.4 ms a frame of which
  about 3 ms was waiting for the DAC. `layout-714`, `layout-51`, the demo, `714-none`, `714-spx`,
  `714-cpl` and `714-tpn` had none either, and every level was the host's Lo/Ro to the digit.
  `714-aht`, `714-all` and `714-ecpl` still ran dry: 7, 10 and 13 blocks.
- **Onto twelve slots over WiFi**, through the null sink: `714-walk` 27.0 ms a frame, `714-tones`
  26.9, `714-none` 24.9, `layout-714` 23.7, `714-spx` 28.5, `714-cpl` 28.8 and `714-tpn` 27.7;
  `714-aht` 33.4, `714-all` 36.8 and `714-ecpl` 55.7. Every slot of every play had the base
  image's level.
- **A local source**, `714-tones.ec3` from the partition with no PSRAM: folded to 2.0 with twelve
  DMA descriptors, none of 1,512 blocks reached an empty queue; onto twelve slots, 23.9 ms a
  frame.
- **Under QEMU**, as CI runs them: `sdkconfig.ci` with the hold on and `sdkconfig.ci-tdm`, with
  their levels, the capture checks and the console check; and the stream set over QEMU's
  Ethernet, where `check_stream_set.py check` and `play` passed with every stream `ok`. The web
  page's Playwright check in that step was not run.
- **On the host**, `[unit_hold]` and `[block_ring]` pass under MSVC, and both test files compile
  under clang-cl 22 with the warning set CI uses, `-Wdouble-promotion` and `-Werror` among it.
- **Internal RAM under load**, measured on the board on 2026-09-11 on the branch at baa633fd,
  with a 16 KB instruction cache as a control, and with #654 merged. Each image loaded the page
  and `ui.js`, polled `/status`, sent `PUT /layout` mid-play and an invalid layout, and started a
  second play of `714-walk` repeated twelve times, with the internal heap's local minimum taken
  each second. Nothing failed: every request was answered, with no allocation failure and no
  abort. The least free internal heap, counting the 32 KB reserved for internal-only allocations,
  fell to 935 and 979 bytes at a play's start with #654 merged, and the requests did not lower
  it. Mid-play it moved little with the cache size; the cache's 16 KB shows at a play's start and
  in the largest free block. The margin is thin: it is about what the image with both caches at
  their largest lost when a FreeRTOS mutex could not be allocated.

## What cannot be verified

- **A DAC on twelve slots.** There is none here, and one S3 I2S controller cannot carry twelve
  32-bit slots.
- **Time and WiFi under QEMU.** QEMU has neither, so those figures come from board runs only.
