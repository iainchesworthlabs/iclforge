# Roadmap inventory (codebase reconciliation)

!!! note "Status as of 2026-09-30: a snapshot of 2026-09-17, not kept current"
    This page reconciled the roadmap, the plans and the tree on 2026-09-17 so that the slim
    [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) could be written, and that work is done. The tables below are
    left as they were and are not updated; the roadmap is the live board. These rows are the ones
    the tree has since overtaken:

    | Row | On 2026-09-17 | On 2026-09-30 |
    |---|---|---|
    | Hearth desktop window | The engine only; no `apps/hearth/ui/` | The Qt window, network output to Sendspin groups, and packages are built; a user guide and screenshots of the running app are not |
    | Hearth Sendspin server in the app | Protocol library and test tools; the engine had no `ServerHost` | The engine hosts the server, and the app plays to groups |
    | Hearth UI design (A0) | No signed design record | Signed off on 2026-09-22 ([hearth-design.md](hearth-design.md)) |
    | Hearth ESP32-C6 sink | Not started | Built as a stereo player, with firmware images published from the next release; also an ESP32-P4 sink for silicon revision v1.x |
    | AC-4 audio decode | Syntax only, "produces no audio yet" | The decoder (D1 to D11), the encoder (E1 to E10) and the applications (I1 to I5b) are built; ESP32 sinks taking AC-4 in a group (I6) are not ([ac4.md](ac4.md)) |
    | Multi-programme E-AC-3 | Authoring done; mixing-metadata reporting open | Reporting done (#797); combining an associated service with the main programme is not built ([the plan](eac3-programme-mixing-metadata.md)) |
    | QC delivery report file, DAW host plugin, topology | Proposed | Unchanged: nothing is built ([qc-report.md](qc-report.md), [host-plugin.md](host-plugin.md), [topology.md](topology.md)) |
    | `AC3FORGE_BUILD_HEARTH` | Default OFF | Default ON; `AC3FORGE_BUILD_AC4` now builds the encoder as well as the inspector and decoder |
    | The "UX12 stale text" | To fix when rewriting | Fixed by the rewrite |

    The other rows (IM5, VX9, VX12, AP1, UX12, UX7, DR9 and the proposed and blocked items) were
    not re-audited for this note; ROADMAP.md, reviewed on 2026-09-26, is their source. The
    scorecard in section D is the Hearth chips as they stood then: by 2026-09-30 A0 to A7 and B1 to
    B5 and C1 to C3 are built, A8 partly, and chip D is built apart from the ESP32 sinks
    ([hearth-reference-player.md](hearth-reference-player.md) has the per-phase state).

Working document for the `feature/roadmap-simplify` rewrite. **Not published to the
documentation site.** Reconciles `ROADMAP.md`, `planning/*.md`, product index pages, and the
tree as of **2026-09-17** on `main` (`a7d3bd56`).

## Purpose

Before replacing `ROADMAP.md` with a slim status board, every non-shipped item is checked against
code. Each row records what is **done**, what is **not done**, whether existing docs are
**accurate**, and the **plain-English line** the new roadmap should carry.

## How to read the columns

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Shipped · In progress · Partial · Proposed · Blocked · Out of scope |
| **Doc accuracy** | Accurate · Misleading · Missing · Stale |
| **New roadmap line** | Draft one-liner for the slim `ROADMAP.md` (no new IDs) |

**Verification rules used here:**

- **Shipped** — tests or CI exercise it; recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` and/or `capabilities.md`.
- **Partial** — boundary named in code (header comment, CMake gate, or test scope).
- **Missing** — merged or in-flight on `main` but absent from `ROADMAP.md` structured sections.
- **Stale** — `ROADMAP.md` contradicts product pages or the tree.

---

## Summary counts

| Category | Count |
|---|---|
| Active ROADMAP items (in progress / considering) | 19 IDs |
| Missing from ROADMAP (material on `main`) | 8 themes |
| Stale or misleading ROADMAP entries | 3 |
| Planning-only proposed work (no ROADMAP ID) | 4 |
| Shipped items in current ROADMAP (to remove from slim file) | ~81 |

---

## A. Missing from `ROADMAP.md`

These are the largest gaps. Substantial code exists; the current roadmap has no Hearth theme and
no AC-4 decode entry.

| Plain-English name | Doc sources | Code anchors | Done | Not done | Status | Doc accuracy | New roadmap line |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Hearth desktop window** | `hearth-reference-player.md` A5; `docs/hearth/index.md` | No `apps/hearth/ui/`; engine in `apps/hearth/engine/`; 17 `tests/hearth/*.cpp` files | Engine, transport, gapless, passthrough, meters, settings model, diagnostics | Qt window, drag/drop queue UI, A6 network UI, A7 packaging, A8 user guide | **In progress** | **Missing** (planning only) | Desktop player engine is in CI; the application window and packaging are not started. |
| **Hearth Sendspin server in app** | `hearth-reference-player.md` A4 | `pairing_store.*` in engine; `src/sendspin/`; `tests/hearth/test_group.cpp` uses `ServerHost` directly; `apps/hearth/engine/CMakeLists.txt`: "ac3::sendspin joins when the network output lands" | Protocol library, testserver, testsink, group/pairing tests, aiosendspin CI exit | `ServerHost` wired into `ac3hearth_engine` for network output | **Partial** | **Misleading** if A4 read as fully merged in app | Sendspin library and test tools work; the desktop app does not host a server yet. |
| **Hearth UI design (A0)** | `hearth-reference-player.md` A0 | No signed design record in repo | Decision log in planning page | Published design round sign-off before A5 | **Proposed** | **Missing** | UI design must be signed off before the window phase starts. |
| **Hearth ESP32-C6 sink** | `hearth-reference-player.md` C3 | C6 decoder/build (`esp-idf/…`); no C6 sink guide; no Sendspin CI for C6 | C1–C2 bring-up | Sendspin sink firmware and guide (follows S3 sink) | **Not started** | **Missing** | C6 Sendspin sink follows the S3 sink pattern. |
| **AC-4 audio decode** | Chip D in hearth plan; IM4 (inspect only) | `src/ac4/` inspect; `src/ac4dec/` syntax trace (`decoder.hpp`: "produces no audio yet"); `tests/ac4dec/`, `tests/golden/ac4dec/*.tsv` | TOC/framing (shared with inspect); channel-coded syntax transcription; DRC metadata parsing in syntax layer | PCM output; speech frontend; object/immersive substreams; 96/192 kHz; dialogue enhancement decode | **Partial** | **Misleading** (IM4 "complete" reads as full AC-4) | AC-4 container inspect is shipped; audio decode is syntax-only so far. |
| **QC delivery report file** | `planning/qc-report.md`; `planning/README.md` | `ac3cli qc` prints to stdout only | QC analysis in CLI/GUI | File-shaped delivery report on disk | **Proposed** | **Missing** | A file export for QC results is proposed, not started. |
| **DAW/NLE host plugin study** | `planning/host-plugin.md` | No plugin code | Feasibility study | Any product decision or implementation | **Proposed** | **Missing** (AP10 is GStreamer/FFmpeg only) | Whether a host plugin is worth building is an open study. |
| **Topology / transport roles** | `planning/topology.md` | Decision 1 taken; no transport implementation | Source/transport/sink vocabulary | HLS/CMAF transport for non-Hearth members (Hearth uses Sendspin) | **Proposed / mostly superseded** | **Missing** | Shared transport vocabulary is decided; Hearth sinks use Sendspin instead of HLS. |

---

## B. Active `ROADMAP.md` items (reconciled)

### B1. In progress

| ID | Plain-English name | Code anchors | Done | Not done | Status | Doc accuracy | New roadmap line |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **IM5** | TrueHD experimental module | No `AC3FORGE_BUILD_MLP` on `main`; work on `feature/truehd-atmos-support` branch per ROADMAP | Internal codec on branch | Rebase, gate as `ac3::mlp`, label output, merge to `main`; authenticity = Evolution frame HMAC (not EMDF) — see ROADMAP IM5 note / object-signing sibling | **In progress** (off main) | Accurate | Land TrueHD/MLP as an experimental, accurately labelled module from its long-lived branch. |
| **VX9** | Listening test session | `tools/listening/`; `tools/listening/responses/README.md`: "No listening session has been run yet" | Blind stimulus generator, scorer, protocol on `docs/landscape.md` | Human MUSHRA/ABX session over real programme material | **Partial** | Accurate | Listening-test apparatus is merged; the session itself has not been run. |
| **VX12** | Cross-toolchain bitstream reproducibility | ROADMAP self-labels PARTIAL; `tests/ac3/encoder/test_coupling.cpp` (`ilogb` fix); `tests/ac3/encoder/test_transient.cpp` all six rates | Audit complete; one libm fix landed; transient detector proven bit-identical on five toolchain legs | Fixed-point transient port; re-validation of coupling-fit/AHT/rematrix thresholds; cross-leg gold gate blocked on VX11 arm64 root cause | **Partial** | Accurate | Encoder bit-cost decisions are mostly audited; perceptual re-validation and a few FP comparisons remain open. |
| **AP1** | API freeze → v1.0.0 | `docs/library/api-stability.md`; version macros in `ac3forge.h`; `.github/workflows/_ci-core.yml` `ABI_ENFORCE: 'false'`; `SOVERSION "${PROJECT_VERSION}"` in library CMake | Tiering doc, SemVer policy, release criteria, C version macros | Flip `SOVERSION` to major; `inline namespace v1`; make ABI gate **required** | **In progress** | Accurate | v1.0 policy is written; SOVERSION and a enforcing ABI gate wait for the v1.0.0 cut. |
| **UX12** | Crucible promotion | `apps/crucible/`; CI `crucible: true` on Windows/Linux legs; `docs/crucible/index.md` | Rename; Windows + Linux verified on hardware (Pi); engine, window, packages on Linux; macOS platform code | macOS interactive run; native-speaker translation review (→ CR1); attestation-signed Windows driver | **Partial** | **Stale** in ROADMAP summary (see below) | Crucible ships on Windows and Linux; macOS compiles in CI but has never run with audio on a Mac. |
| **UX7** | macOS process tap | `src/audio/src/backend/macos/process_tap.mm`; `audio_backend.cpp` refuses `process_loopback` unless `AC3FORGE_MACOS_PROCESS_TAP` | Tap code compiles; device watcher registers; opt-in env var | `AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID` hang; path disabled by default; no successful capture on Mac | **Partial** | Accurate (2026-09-06 update) | macOS process tap code exists but is refused by default until the HAL hang is resolved. |
| **DR9** | Hardware confirmation per backend | `docs/platforms/raspberry-pi.md`, `windows.md`; `docs/crucible/design/promotion.md` | Linux/ALSA passthrough; PipeWire on Pi; Windows WASAPI exclusive to Onkyo AVR | CoreAudio tap on real Mac; Crucible on Mac; Pi 5; second Android TV | **Partial** | Accurate | ALSA, PipeWire and WASAPI passthrough are confirmed; CoreAudio and desktop Mac runs are not. |

#### UX12 stale text (must fix when rewriting)

`ROADMAP.md` lines ~2598–2602 still say macOS "none of it has been compiled" and "CI has not
reported back." **`docs/crucible/index.md`** (2026-09-06+) and **DR9** record macOS CI compile,
link, and headless QML suite runs. The accurate gap is **no interactive Mac session with audio**,
not "does not compile."

### B2. Considering / proposed / blocked

| ID | Plain-English name | Code anchors | Status | Doc accuracy | New roadmap line |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **EQ2** | Per-channel/per-block SNR offsets | Swept and declined per ROADMAP full record | **Out of scope** (tried, declined) | Accurate | Declined after measurement; reference encoders agree with shipped behaviour. |
| **EQ14** | Perceptual criterion calibration | `kPerceptual` in encoder search; open threads from EQ13 | **Proposed** | Accurate | Calibrate the perceptual encoder criterion (EQ13 follow-on). |
| **IM6** | TrueHD interoperability | Blocked on non-public MLP reference and clean-room ruling | **Blocked** | Accurate | Real TrueHD interoperability stays blocked on sources and clean-room policy. |
| **VX5** | Dolby Reference Player wider CI | Licensed player wired locally; crosscheck loop narrow | **Proposed** | Accurate | Widen Reference Player crosschecks (ecpl, tpn, 7.1.4, compr) and run in CI. |
| **AP8** | Generated API reference / versioned docs | No Doxygen/mike pipeline | **Proposed** | Accurate | Generated API reference and versioned docs are not started. |
| **AP10** | GStreamer / FFmpeg encode wrapper | Needs C API (AP5 shipped); no out-of-tree element | **Proposed** | Accurate | Out-of-tree GStreamer/FFmpeg wrapper for >5.1 and JOC encode. |
| **UX10** | TrueHD Forge front ends | Rides IM5 branch GUI/CLI | **Proposed** | Accurate | TrueHD GUI/CLI front ends follow the experimental TrueHD module (IM5). |
| **CR1** | Crucible translation reading | Six `ac3crucible_*.ts` at 385 messages, 0 unfinished | **Partial** | Accurate | Mechanically translated Crucible strings need native-speaker review. |
| **DR3** | vcpkg git registry | Registry not published | **Proposed** | Accurate | Publish a vcpkg git registry for `vcpkg install ac3forge`. |
| **DR4** | winget / ConanCenter | Manifests staged; CLA/submission pending | **Proposed** | Accurate | winget and ConanCenter submissions wait on paperwork. |
| **DR6** | Code signing | Known gap since 0.8.0-beta.2; test-signed Windows driver only | **Blocked** (certificates) | Accurate | macOS notarisation and Windows Authenticode wait on certificates. |

## C. Shipped items misread as roadmap work

These are **shipped** but easy to misread without a done/not-done split. They must **not** appear
as active roadmap rows; the new roadmap may mention them only in a legacy index or link to
`CHANGELOG.md`.

| Topic | ROADMAP | Code / docs truth | Inventory note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AC-4 inspect** | IM4 Shipped | `src/ac4/include/iclforge/ac4/ac4.hpp`: "INSPECTOR, not a decoder"; `capabilities.md` AC-4 row | Shipped scope = parse/inspect + carriage in MP4/TS |
| **AC-4 decode** | *(absent)* | `src/ac4dec/`: syntax only | **Partial** — separate row in section A |
| **IAMF** | IM3 Shipped (phase 1) | `iamf/iamf.hpp`: "phase 1 of 3"; phases 2–3 wait on IAMF v2.0 final | Shipped = channel-based writer; object elements **blocked** |
| **IAB** | IM1 Shipped | `iab`: reader, `dlc.hpp` decode, `writer.hpp` write and `encode_dlc` | Shipped = elementary IABitstream read and write, and `write_mxf_iab` for the ST 2067-201 Track File; an IMF validator run on it is the open follow-on |
| **Multi-programme E-AC-3** | *(capabilities wording)* | `encode.cpp` generalizes `programme2=`..`programme8=`, each with its own `bsmod`/full `mixmdate` via `programmeN-<field>=`; `capabilities.md` L24 updated | **Shipped** — authoring complete for all eight §E2.3.1.2 substreams; receiver-side use of the metadata during mixdown remains a separate, open follow-on |
| **E-AC-3 programme decode** | DC5 Shipped (structural) | `DecoderConfig::programme` selects one programme at a time | Shipped = structural; mixing metadata decode per DC4 |

---

## D. Hearth chip scorecard (planning vs tree)

From `planning/hearth-reference-player.md` status block, verified against `main`.

| Chip | Planning claim | Tree check | Inventory status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A0** | Design round published, awaits review | No standalone design doc in repo | **Proposed** — gate for A5 |
| **A1** | Merged | `src/render/include/iclforge/render/*` (Experimental tier in api-stability) | **Shipped** |
| **A2** | Merged | `src/audio/` backends, routing, device watch | **Shipped** (hardware identify tone checks still open per plan) |
| **A3** | Merged | `apps/hearth/engine/*`, 17 hearth test files | **Shipped** |
| **A4** | Merged | Sendspin lib + testserver + tests; **engine lacks ServerHost** | **Partial** |
| **A5** | Not started | No `apps/hearth/ui/` | **Not started** |
| **A6–A8** | Follow A5 | — | **Not started** |
| **B1–B5** | Merged | `hearth_sink` example, Sendspin CI (`hearth-esp32s3` job) | **Partial** — firmware done; TDM DAC + Music Assistant on real MA open |
| **C1–C2** | Merged | ESP32-C6 fixed-point path | **Shipped** |
| **C3** | Follows B | No C6 sink guide/CI | **Not started** |
| **D** | First code merged | `src/ac4dec` syntax only | **Partial** — see section A |

**Open hardware exits** (called out in planning, not in ROADMAP): Onkyo identify tone and
passthrough tests for A2/A3; TDM DAC boards for sinks; Music Assistant compatibility on real MA
(B3/A4 exits — aiosendspin 9.1.1 scripted exit passes in CI).

---

## E. Product pages vs ROADMAP (authority check)

| Product | Authoritative page | Agrees with inventory? | Action for rewrite |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Library** | `docs/library/capabilities.md` | Yes for AC-4, IAMF, IAB boundaries | Split AC-4 inspect/decode in capabilities if needed |
| **Hearth** | `docs/hearth/index.md` | Yes — "no window", sink works | Roadmap links here; add explicit AC-4 decode row |
| **Crucible** | `docs/crucible/index.md` | Yes — macOS compiles, never run with audio | Fix ROADMAP UX12 stale summary |
| **Forge** | `docs/forge/index.md` | *(not fully audited this pass)* | Spot-check when writing slim roadmap |

---

## F. CMake / CI map (build truth)

| Flag / job | Path | Default | Roadmap relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AC3FORGE_BUILD_AC4` | `src/ac4`, `src/ac4dec` | ON | AC-4 inspect + syntax decoder |
| `AC3FORGE_BUILD_HEARTH` | `src/sendspin`, `apps/hearth` | OFF | Hearth engine/tests when ON |
| `AC3FORGE_BUILD_CRUCIBLE` | `apps/crucible` | OFF | UX12; CI sets ON on selected legs |
| `AC3FORGE_BUILD_IAMF` | `src/iamf` | ON | IM3 phase 1 |
| `AC3FORGE_BUILD_IAB` | `src/iab` | ON | IM1 |
| `AC3FORGE_BUILD_ADM` | `src/adm`, `src/admbridge` | OFF | ADM/JOC bridge optional |
| `hearth-esp32s3` CI job | `.github/workflows/_build.yml` | — | B-chip sink verification |
| `ABI_ENFORCE` | `_ci-core.yml` | `false` | AP1 deferred gate |

---

## G. Legacy ID → new plain names (for slim ROADMAP footer)

Do **not** allocate new IDs. One old ID may map to **multiple** new names when scope was conflated.

| Legacy ID | New plain name(s) | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| IM4 | AC-4 container inspect | Shipped — leave CHANGELOG |
| *(none)* | AC-4 audio decode | Partial — new row |
| IM3 | IAMF channel-based writer | Shipped |
| *(IM3 tail)* | IAMF object elements + reader | Blocked on IAMF v2.0 |
| IM1 | IAB reader | Shipped |
| *(IM1 tail)* | IAB MXF Track File write | Shipped (`write_mxf_iab`) |
| UX12 | Crucible cross-platform product | Partial |
| UX7 | macOS process tap | Partial |
| AP1 | API freeze v1.0 | In progress |
| DR9 | Hardware verification | Partial |
| A5 *(planning)* | Hearth desktop window | Not started |
