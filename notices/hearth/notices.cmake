# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hearth's NOTICES.txt: the third-party software libs/sendspin brings into Hearth's programs,
# plus - on Windows and macOS - the Qt it bundles (planning/hearth-reference-player.md,
# Dependencies), assembled by cmake/Notices.cmake from the fragments beside this file (and, for
# the Qt section, apps/crucible/notices/fragments/, shared rather than copied - see that file's
# header). The licence texts are the copyright files vcpkg installs with each port, and the
# versions are those vcpkg recorded (Qt's from apps/hearth/ui/CMakeLists.txt's own find_package),
# so the file describes what this build actually links and bundles.
#
# Written to ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/notices/hearth/NOTICES.txt. The `hearth` package component (A7,
# apps/hearth/ui/CMakeLists.txt's install() rules) installs it at the package root on Windows and
# macOS and under share/doc/iclforge-hearth/ on Linux; the test sink, unpackaged, does not.
#
# include()d from apps/hearth/CMakeLists.txt for a full Sendspin build only, AFTER that file's
# add_subdirectory(ui) - this file's Qt section needs ui/'s own PARENT_SCOPE exports
# (ICLFORGE_HEARTH_UI_QT_FOUND, ICLFORGE_HEARTH_UI_QT_VERSION), which only exist once ui/ has run. A
# core-only build (ICLFORGE_SENDSPIN_CORE_ONLY) skips ui/ along with this file entirely, so
# neither var is ever read there.
