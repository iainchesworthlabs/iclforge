# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Forge's NOTICES.txt and LICENSE.txt - what the `runtime` component (forge
# and forge-gui) actually installs, on every platform that packages it.
#
# Until this existed, no Forge package carried either file. cmake/Packaging.cmake's
# CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE only makes the NSIS and DragNDrop installers
# DISPLAY the licence while installing; nothing landed on disk, so a .zip, a
# .deb, a .rpm, a .dmg or the AppImage could be unpacked and read end to end
# without finding the GPL text, the LGPL text for the Qt forge-gui ships on
# Windows and macOS, the SIL OFL for the typefaces it embeds, or the MIT text
# for the {fmt} compiled into both binaries.
#
# include()d from the top-level CMakeLists.txt, after apps/forge/cli/src and apps/forge/gui
# have added their targets - so ICLFORGE_BUILD_CLI/ICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI are
# settled and every one of those directories' own install() rules has run -
# and before include(Packaging), which needs the install rules below to exist
# for the component to contain them.
#
# The platform is a directory, platform/<os>/components.cmake, the same rule
# notices/ follows and the same rule the C++ platform trees
# follow (tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1): the per-platform strings
# live in one small file per operating system rather than in an if() chain
# threaded through the prose. What is NOT a platform - whether the GUI was
# built at all - is decided here, because it applies to all three.
#
# Qt6_VERSION cannot be read here: apps/forge/gui's find_package(Qt6) ran inside
# add_subdirectory()'s own scope, which does not reach the top level. That is
# what ICLFORGE_GUI_QT_VERSION is for - apps/forge/gui/CMakeLists.txt exports it
# PARENT_SCOPE next to its find_package call, the same shape apps/crucible
# already uses for ICLFORGE_CRUCIBLE_X11_BACKEND.

# Where the two files land. COMPONENT runtime for the pair above - the same
# component forge, forge-gui, the man page, the completions and the XDG files
# already install under, so every generator picks them up with the binaries
# rather than needing a component of their own (cmake/Packaging.cmake).
#
# The licence also goes into the two library components, `library` (the
# headers, the import library and the CMake package - the iclforge-dev-*
# archive, libiclforge-dev, iclforge-devel) and `libruntime` (the shared
# object alone - libiclforge0). Both reach someone who never downloads the
# runtime archive, and a library handed over under the GPL with no copy of
# the licence beside it is the omission this file exists to close. Debian
# policy asks for a copyright file in every binary package, not only the one
# carrying the binaries.
#
# They take the licence alone, not the notices: the notices describe what a
# built application bundles - Qt, the fonts, the Windows runtime - and none
# of that is in a library package.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# is the only path dpkg and lintian look at: /usr/share/doc/<binary package>/
# copyright. A copy under share/doc/iclforge/ satisfies the runtime package
# and nothing else, so libiclforge-dev and libiclforge0 would each ship a
# GPL library with no copyright file of their own - which is the omission
# this block exists to close, appearing to be closed. The names come from
# cmake/Packaging.cmake's CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_NAME.
