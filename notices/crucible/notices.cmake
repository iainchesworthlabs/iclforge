# include()d from ../../apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt once the two build facts that change the
# file are known - whether a Qt kit was found, and whether it has Quick 3D -
# and before anything reads ICLFORGE_CRUCIBLE_NOTICES_FILE: the resource embeddings
# (the window's and the test binary's) and the install rules.
#
# The platform is a directory, platform/<os>/components.cmake, chosen by
# ICLFORGE_CRUCIBLE_PLATFORM_DIR, which the engine's platform arms set - the same
# rule as engine/platform/ and ui/platform/: no fragment, QML or C++ file
# tests the operating system. The two fragments inserted here depend on a
# build option, not a platform, and are gated by the same variables that
# already gate Room3DView.qml and iclforge::tracy.
