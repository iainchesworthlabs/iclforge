# The Linux package's notices (../../notices.cmake, cmake/Notices.cmake):
# what the tarball and the .deb carry, as the sections of NOTICES.txt in the
# order they appear. No Qt section for a bundled Qt (the package includes
# none; the loader finds the system's) and no driver section (the silent
# device is a PipeWire node the application makes). The two sections that
# depend on a build option - qt-quick3d, tracy - are inserted by
# notices.cmake, so nothing here names an option.
