// IEC 61937 ("S/PDIF burst") packing: an AC-3 or E-AC-3 access unit disguised
// as 16-bit stereo PCM so AV receivers accept it over S/PDIF or HDMI.
//
// AC-3: each burst is exactly 6144 bytes (1536 stereo 16-bit sample frames —
// one AC-3 frame duration at any AC-3 sample rate): the four preamble words
// Pa 0xF872, Pb 0x4E1F, Pc (data type 1 = AC-3, with bsmod in bits 8..10), Pd
// (payload length in BITS), then the frame bytes packed big-endian into
// words, zero-padded to the burst length. Words are emitted little-endian,
// ready for a PCM16 container; byte-exact against FFmpeg's spdif muxer as the
// oracle.
//
// E-AC-3: verified against two independent primary sources (FFmpeg's
// libavformat/spdifenc.c spdif_header_eac3, and Microsoft's own "Representing
// Formats for IEC 61937 Transmissions" — the two agree). The burst is fixed
// at 24576 bytes (4x AC-3's, matching WASAPI's requirement that the carrier
// clock run at 4x the content sample rate for Dolby Digital Plus), Pc is data
// type 0x15 with no extra bits, and Pd is the payload length in BYTES rather
// than bits — unlike AC-3's Pd, the detail most likely to be copied wrong
// from the AC-3 shape. Annex E lets one syncframe cover as few as one of the
// six blocks a burst period spans (numblkscod, Table E2.4), so
// Eac3BurstPacker accumulates consecutive access units until their block
// counts reach six before emitting a burst.
//
// AC-4: written from IEC 61937-14:2017, with IEC 61937-1:2021 (and its 2024
// corrigendum) for the burst format and IEC 61937-2:2021+AMD1:2026 for the
// data type, which is 24 with a subdata type in Pc bits 5 and 6. Each frame
// travels alone in a burst whose repetition period is the frame's duration,
// so the period follows the stream's frame rate instead of being fixed; see

// its bursts are already destroyed, which shows up here as no detection.
