// The read side of iclforge::containers::matroska::mux()/iclforge::containers::matroska::Writer:
// pulling one audio track's frames back out of a Matroska file.
//
// This is a container reader and nothing more, in exactly the sense the
// writer beside it is a container writer and nothing more (see
// matroska/matroska.hpp): it walks EBML, finds the track the caller asked
// for, and hands each frame back as opaque bytes. It has NO dependency on
// iclforge::ac3 and no knowledge of AC-3 - what comes out is whatever the muxer
// put in. The one place it names a codec is track auto-selection
// (kCodecAc3/kCodecEac3, the same two CodecID strings the writer already
// declares); a caller that wants some other track says so by number.
//
// Two shapes, mirroring the write side exactly:
//
//   demux()  - batch, and ZERO-COPY: the frames it returns are spans into
//              the caller's own buffer, the way iclforge::ac3::io::scan already hands
//              back access units. For a caller that has the file resident
//              anyway.
//   Reader   - incremental, for a file too big to hold: push() chunks in,
//              frames come back through a callback. Peak memory is one
//              frame plus one chunk, never the file - the same bound
//              iclforge::containers::matroska::Writer offers on the way out.
//
// Both run the same EBML walker (src/containers/src/matroska/reader.cpp); the only
// difference is where the bytes come from and where the frames point.
//
// UNTRUSTED INPUT. A container arrives from a disc rip, a broadcast capture
// or an HTTP download - not from this project's own writer. Every length in
// an EBML file is self-declared, so a malformed or hostile one can claim an
// element is gigabytes long, nest masters until a recursive walker runs out
// of stack, or lace a block into hundreds of frames whose declared sizes
// overrun it. ReadOptions below bounds the first two, split_block() rejects
// the third, and fuzz/fuzz_matroska_demux.cpp drives the whole walker with
// arbitrary bytes.
