// A minimal MP4 (ISOBMFF) muxer, per ISO/IEC 14496-12 (the ISO Base Media
// File Format).
//
// This is a container writer and nothing more, in exactly the sense
// iclforge::containers::matroska is: it knows how to nest ISOBMFF boxes and lay out one
// audio track's samples, and it takes each frame - and the codec's own
// configuration box payload - as opaque bytes. It has NO dependency on
// iclforge::ac3 and no knowledge of AC-3: a caller muxing E-AC-3 hands over
// whole access units plus a ready-made 'dec3' payload (see
// iclforge::ac3::io::build_codec_config_box, ac3/io/dec3.hpp); a caller muxing
// something else hands over whatever its own frames and sample-entry config
// box are. Keeping the codec-specific box payload opaque here is exactly why
// iclforge::containers::matroska stays codec-blind too, applied to the one place MP4
// needs codec-specific bytes that Matroska's plain CodecID string does not:
// see iclforge::containers::mp4::AudioTrack::codec_config below.
//
// Deliberately small. Enough to produce a file a player will open with the
// right channel layout, duration and codec signalling:
//   - one audio track, ftyp/moov/mdat only,
//   - one sample per chunk (no interleaving/multi-track concerns to solve),
//   - stts/stsz/stco built straight off the frame sizes handed in.
// No multiple tracks, and an edit list only when MuxOptions::edit asks for
// its one edit. Multiple tracks matter for multi-track muxing, not for
// playing back what this project produces.
//
// fragment() below (ROADMAP.md's A2) is the fMP4/CMAF follow-up mux() itself
// used to defer: an initialization segment plus one or more media segments,
// built from the same opaque AudioTrack/frame shape - see its own comment
// further down. FragmentWriter beside it is the incremental form of the
// same thing, for a session whose length is not known up front. mp4/hls.hpp
// and mp4/dash.hpp build the HLS media playlist and DASH MPD that point at
// what either produces.
