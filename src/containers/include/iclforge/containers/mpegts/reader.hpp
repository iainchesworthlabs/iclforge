// The read side of iclforge::mpegts::mux()/iclforge::mpegts::Writer: pulling one programme's
// audio back out of a transport stream.
//
// A container reader and nothing more, the same way the writer beside it is
// a container writer and nothing more (see mpegts/mpegts.hpp): it locks to
// the packet grid, follows PAT to PMT to an elementary PID, reassembles PES,
// and hands the payloads back as opaque bytes. It links nothing from
// iclforge::ac3.
//
// WHAT A "FRAME" IS HERE, AND WHY IT DIFFERS FROM THE SIBLINGS. A Matroska
// SimpleBlock and an MP4 sample each hold exactly one access unit, so those
// readers hand back access units. A PES packet does not promise that: it may
// carry one access unit (which is what mux() writes), several, or - with the
// unbounded PES_packet_length broadcast uses - a run of them ending only
// when the next one starts. So this reader hands back PES PAYLOADS, and what
// they concatenate to is the elementary stream. That is exactly what
// iclforge::ac3::io::scan wants, and re-framing them into access units is its job, not
// this module's: doing it here would mean knowing what an AC-3 syncframe is.
//
// BOTH SIGNALLING PROFILES, unlike the writer. mux() implements DVB
// (stream_type 0x06 plus ETSI EN 300 468 Annex D's AC3_descriptor /
// Enhanced_AC3_descriptor) and says why in its own header. A reader has no
// such luxury: an ATSC broadcast capture or a North American disc rip uses
// stream_type 0x81/0x87 instead, and a third family of streams names the
// codec through a registration_descriptor's 'AC-3'/'EAC3' format_identifier.
// All three are recognised, because all three are what arrives.
//
// PACKET SIZES. 188 bytes is the ISO/IEC 13818-1 packet. A Blu-ray or AVCHD
// rip is M2TS: the same packets with a 4-byte arrival timestamp in front of
// each, so 192. A DVB recording off a satellite card may carry 16 bytes of
// Reed-Solomon parity after each, so 204. The grid size is detected from the
// sync-byte spacing rather than assumed.
//
// UNTRUSTED INPUT. A transport stream is the format most likely to arrive
// damaged - it is designed to be tuned into mid-flight and to survive bit
// errors - so "malformed" is the normal case rather than the exceptional
// one. Every PSI section's CRC is checked before it is believed, a section
// or PES that outruns its declared length is dropped rather than trusted,
// and ReadOptions bounds what may be buffered. fuzz/fuzz_mpegts_demux.cpp
// drives both entry points with arbitrary bytes.
