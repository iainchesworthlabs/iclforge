// A minimal MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) muxer, per ISO/IEC 13818-1 (MPEG-2
// Systems), with the AC-3/Enhanced AC-3 identification DVB defines in ETSI
// EN 300 468 Annex D.
//
// This is a container writer and nothing more: it lays out 188-byte TS
// packets and takes each access unit as opaque bytes. It has NO dependency
// on iclforge::ac3 beyond the caller telling it AC-3 vs. E-AC-3 (AudioCodec,
// below) - which is the point of keeping it a separate library, the same
// shape as iclforge::containers::matroska (src/containers/src/matroska/). A caller muxing E-AC-3 hands
// over whole access units; the module knows nothing about what is inside
// them.
//
// Scope, deliberately narrow for a first, mergeable implementation:
//   - single program: one PAT, one PMT, one elementary stream, all on PIDs
//     the caller can override but that default to values clear of the
//     0x0000-0x001F reserved range (ISO/IEC 13818-1 Table 2-3);
//   - PAT and PMT are re-sent periodically so a receiver tuning in mid-
//     stream does not have to wait for the very first packet - common
//     broadcast practice, not something ISO/IEC 13818-1 itself mandates for
//     a stream this simple;
//   - PCR runs on the audio PID (there is no other PID to carry it), stamped
//     once per access unit - AC-3/E-AC-3's largest possible frame duration
//     (1536 samples at the slowest Annex E fscod2 rate, 16 kHz) is 96 ms,
//     comfortably inside the 100 ms bound §2.7.2 sets for how far apart two
//     PCR values may be, so "once per access unit" is enough on its own
//     without a separate timer;
//   - no video, no other elementary streams, no PID remapping, no seek aids.
// A general-purpose multiplexer is out of scope; this is enough to produce a
// stream a player or `ffprobe` recognizes as one AC-3/E-AC-3 programme.
//
// Broadcast profile: DVB or ATSC, chosen per stream (MuxOptions::profile).
// Both standards register AC-3/E-AC-3 for MPEG-TS carriage, but with
// different, non-interoperable signalling - a different stream_type, and a
// different descriptor registry - so a stream is written to satisfy ONE of
// them, never a bit of each:
//
//   - DVB (BroadcastProfile::kDvb, the default): stream_type 0x06, audio
//     carried as PES private data (ISO/IEC 13818-1 Table 2-34), identified
//     by the AC3_descriptor (tag 0x6A) or enhanced_AC-3_descriptor (tag
//     0x7A) ETSI EN 300 468 Annex D.3/D.5 define. DVB registers no
//     stream_type of its own, so the descriptor tag IS the identification
//     (EN 300 468 D.2, and A/52:2018 Annex A §A3's own note on the
//     two systems' opposite choices).
//   - ATSC (BroadcastProfile::kAtsc): stream_type 0x81 for AC-3 (A/52:2018
//     Annex A §A4.1) or 0x87 for E-AC-3 (Annex G §G3.1),
//     identified by the AC-3_audio_stream_descriptor (tag 0x81, Annex A
//     §A4.3, Table A4.1) or the E-AC-3_audio_descriptor (tag 0xCC,
//     Annex G §G3.5, Table G.1). ATSC chose the stream_type as the
//     unique identification and the descriptor as configuration detail - the
//     mirror image of DVB's choice.
//
// Both profiles' descriptors carry the same underlying A/52 field values
// (bsmod, acmod, dsurmod, bsid, the substream ids in use) in different bit
// layouts, so a caller supplies those values once, as ServiceInfo below, and
// this module maps them onto whichever registry's tables the chosen profile
// uses. That mapping - EN 300 468 Tables D.1-D.5, A/52 Tables A4.2-A4.6 and
// G.2-G.4 - is descriptor syntax, which is this module's job; reading those
// values off the bitstream is iclforge::ac3::io::scan's, which is why ServiceInfo is
// plain integers and this module still has no dependency on iclforge::ac3.

// Not every ServiceInfo field survives the round trip, because the wire
// format itself does not carry enough to reconstruct them:
//   - bsmod_present collapses to true whenever a service type was written at
//     all, because Table D.4/G.2/A4.4 have no "not indicated" code of their
//     own - service_type()'s forward mapping already sends "absent" and
//     "explicitly complete main" to the same bits (see mpegts.cpp).
//   - full_service comes back as the bit that was actually sent, not as
//     "was this an explicit override" - the wire cannot tell those apart
//     either, and the resolved value is what a caller re-deriving or
//     displaying it wants.
//   - acmod/channels/lfe/dsurmod are NOT reconstructed and stay at
//     ServiceInfo's own defaults: channel_flags() is a many-to-one summary
//     (Table D.5/G.3/A4.5's ">5.1" and "up to 5.1" rows in particular cover
//     a range, not one value), so guessing a specific acmod back out of it
//     would invent a channel layout the descriptor never actually claimed.
//     A caller that has the elementary stream already has the exact values
//     from iclforge::ac3::io::scan() - the same source mux()'s own caller used.
