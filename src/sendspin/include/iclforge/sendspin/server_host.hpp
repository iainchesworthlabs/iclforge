// A Sendspin server on a computer: every connection to its clients, whichever side dialled, and
// the groups that play to them (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A4, the server half).
//
// The host listens for clients that dial it and advertises _sendspin-server._tcp, browses for
// players that advertise _sendspin._tcp and dials them, and runs a ServerSession under a
// SessionDriver for each connection. It decides each client's activation from the store: a paired
// client, or an approved one on the Sentinel that offers unpaired access, gets playback with
// player@v1; a client whose token the operator entered is re-handshaken to its pairing PSK and
// paired by it; any other waits with no activities until the operator pairs or approves it. A
// paired client that offers _iclforge_player@v1 gets that role instead of player@v1
// (planning/hearth-sendspin-extension.md, The role _iclforge_player@v1).
//
// Groups play one programme to several clients: a member playing player@v1 gets the programme's
// PCM in the first of its formats the group can produce from it (PCM or FLAC at any depth, Opus at
// 48 kHz), and a member playing _iclforge_player@v1 gets the coded stream's bursts, all on one
// timeline started far enough ahead for the member that needs the most lead.
//
// The other roles are activated by policy (planning/hearth-sendspin-extension.md, Other roles):
// controller@v1, metadata@v1 and color@v1 for any client that lists them, artwork@v1 and
// visualizer@v1 for a client that lists them and is not aiosendspin 9.1.1, and source@v1 only for a
// client the operator has allowed it. A group gives its members' roles the programme's metadata,
// colours, transport, artwork and visualizer frames, and applies a controller's volume and mute to
// its players.
//
// Thread-safe. Events arrive on the host's own thread.
