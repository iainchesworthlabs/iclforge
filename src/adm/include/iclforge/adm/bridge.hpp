// Roadmap item B1 phase 2 of 3 ("ADM BWF reader feeding the JOC encoder"): maps
// the object graph iclforge::adm (phase 1) parses from a BW64/ADM master onto
// iclforge::ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder's input shape - one iclforge::oba::ObjectPath plus one mono PCM
// span per channel, ready to drive encode_frame() in a loop. Phase 3 (a CLI/GUI-facing end-to-end
// command) is a separate, later task; this module is the mapping/bridge library only.
//
// iclforge::admbridge sits between two modules that otherwise know nothing about each other:
// iclforge::adm (src/adm, codec-blind by design - see its own header comments) and
// iclforge::ac3/iclforge::oba (src/ac3, always built, no dependency on the opt-in, Boost-requiring
// ac3adm). This module is the one place both are allowed to meet, and - like iclforge::adm
// itself - it is gated behind ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM: it is meaningless without ac3adm, and
// iclforge::ac3 is unconditionally available regardless of whether this module is built at all. See
// src/admbridge/CMakeLists.txt's own header comment for the full reasoning, including why this
// is a new standalone module rather than folded into either side.
//
// a future DAMF reader (out of scope; was B2 `.atmos`/`.atmos.metadata`/`.atmos.audio` reader)
// names this module as the "mapping layer" it plans to share - reason enough to keep the bed/object
// classification, coordinate conversion (coordinates.hpp) and keyframe-timeline construction
// below independent of ac3adm's own BW64/ADM-XML-specific parsing, even though
// iclforge::adm::AdmDocument is still this module's only current input shape.
//
// What gets mapped, and what does not:
//
//   - Classification (DirectSpeakers "bed" vs. Objects "dynamic object") is via the
//     TypeDefinition of the audioObject's own resolved audioPackFormat(s) - never via any
//     property of AudioObject itself, which carries no type of its own (see ac3adm/model.hpp's
//     own AudioPackFormat/AudioObject comments). Matrix, HOA, Binaural, User Custom and Unknown
//     pack types are out of this phase's scope and rejected with BridgeError::kUnsupportedType
//     rather than silently mishandled - none of them map onto AtmosEncoder's plain
//     position+gain+lfe_send object model without a design of their own this phase does not
//     attempt (HOA in particular has no "position" at all; Matrix's audioMatrixFormat encodes an
//     entirely different, coefficient-based routing this bridge does not interpret).
//   - AtmosEncoder has no distinct bed-feeding method: its constructor just takes an object
//     count, and encode_frame() takes one flat span of objects plus one flat span of placements
//     (ac3/oba/atmos.hpp) - nothing in that signature distinguishes "a bed channel" from "a
//     dynamic object". A bed channel is therefore represented the only way the API allows: as an
//     object with an unmoving, pinned placement, the same convention every existing caller
//     (apps/cli/main.cpp's run_atmos_encode, apps/gui/encoder_controller.cpp's encodeObjects)
//     already uses. This module follows suit - a bed channel becomes one more entry in the same
//     flat channel list, with a static (or, rarely, dynamic - see build_channel_path()'s own
//     comment) ObjectPath pinned at its speakerLabel's room position, at unity gain; a bed
//     channel whose speakerLabel identifies it as the LFE (Table 12: "LFE", "LFE1", "LFE2") is
//     instead routed at gain 0 / lfe_send 1, since (per atmos.hpp's own ObjectPlacement comment)
//     "Objects never reach the LFE by panning".
//   - Position/gain automation (ITU-R BS.2076-2 Clause 10.3's jumpPosition/interpolationLength
//     hold-vs-glide state machine) is implemented in build_channel_path() below - see that
//     function's own comment for the full walkthrough, verified against the standard's own
//     Figs 7-10, not assumed from a paraphrase.
//   - What an audioBlockFormat says beyond position and gain is mapped where TS 103 420 has a
//     field for it, and listed in BridgeResult::unmapped where it does not. Carried: width/height/
//     depth (object size), channelLock (snap), zoneExclusion (Annex B.2.6 zone constraints),
//     objectDivergence's value (Tables 40-42) and screenRef (b_object_use_screen_ref). Not carried:
//     diffuse, headLocked, a channelLock maxDistance, divergence's azimuthRange/positionRange, and a
//     zoneExclusion that is not one of Table B.18's presets. AtmosEncoder transmits the carried
//     items in the OAMD payload and stops there - its own bed render treats every object as a point
//     source (see ObjectPlacement). docs/library/adm-bridge.md has the full account.

// Builds one channel's iclforge::oba::ObjectPath from its audioBlockFormat sequence.

// BS.2076-2 §5.4.1: a channel with exactly one audioBlockFormat is static - one keyframe, held
// everywhere (iclforge::oba::KeyframePath's own "a single keyframe holds its placement everywhere"
// behaviour is exactly this).
//
// For more than one block, §10.3's own state machine (verified directly against the standard's
// text and its Figs 7-10, not assumed from a paraphrase - an earlier draft of this bridge had it
// backwards, see docs/library/adm-bridge.md's own note on this):
//
//   - jumpPosition = 0 (or absent): "the renderer will interpolate a moving object between
//     positions over the full duration of the block" - a continuous ramp spanning the block's
//     ENTIRE [rtime, rtime+duration), reaching the block's own value exactly at its end, and
//     continuous with whatever value the timeline already held at the block's start (in practice
//     the previous block's own final value, since audioBlockFormat sequences are contiguous).
//     Mapped to a single keyframe at the block's END time - the natural KeyframePath linear
//     interpolation from the previous block's own already-placed keyframe reproduces the ramp.
//   - jumpPosition = 1: "it will jump to the new position instantly" and then holds - "The value
//     of x is set at the beginning of the block and maintains that value throughout its
//     duration." If interpolationLength is also given, the jump becomes a ramp of that length at
//     the block's start instead of an instant one ("the interpolation period is set to the
//     interpolationLength value"), still followed by a hold for the remainder of the block.
//     Mapped to a keyframe at the ramp's end (start + interpolationLength, or start again if
//     interpolationLength is absent/zero - see kInstantJumpEpsilon's own comment in bridge.cpp
//     for why an exact zero cannot be represented literally), plus a second keyframe at the
//     block's own end holding the same value, unless the ramp already reaches exactly that time.
//   - The FIRST block in a sequence always holds across its own entire span regardless of ITS
//     OWN jumpPosition/interpolationLength: "To ensure undefined behaviour of the first block is
//     avoided, then the position specified in the first block covers the entire length of the
//     block (regardless of the jumpPosition and interpolationLength properties)."
//
// `object_start_s` is the channel's parent audioObject's own start_s (see build()'s own comment
// on why this, plus the block's own rtime_s, is the whole absolute-time computation - no third,
// programme-level term). `force_lfe` overrides every resulting keyframe to gain 0.0/lfe_send 1.0,
// discarding the block's own real position/gain data entirely (see this header's own top comment
// on why) - pass true only for a bed channel whose speakerLabel identifies it as the LFE.
//
// Exposed (not file-local) specifically so this state machine can be tested directly against
// hand-built iclforge::adm::AudioChannelFormat fixtures, independent of a full BW64
// file/<chna>/pack resolution round trip.
