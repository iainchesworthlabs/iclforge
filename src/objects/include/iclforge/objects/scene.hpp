// An object scene: what is in the room, where each thing goes, and when.
//
// AtmosEncoder::encode_frame takes one ObjectPlacement per object per frame
// and nothing more, so every caller that wanted a SCENE - objects with names,
// a bed assignment, automation, a file it can be saved to and reloaded from -
// built its own. forge's atmos-path grew a keyframe-file grammar; the GUI's
// timeline grew a parallel one it exports in that grammar; the
// station-broadcast example hard-codes a cue table in C++; a live position
// source (live OSC object positions) would have grown a third. This is the one description
// they share.
//
// Scope, deliberately: this is METADATA AND AUTHORING. A scene says where an
// object is at a moment in time; turning that into speaker feeds is the
// encoder's job (and a room-corrected render is Cavern's, not this project's -
// see CONTRIBUTING.md). Orientation below is the same kind of thing: it
// rewrites the positions that go into OAMD, so what reaches the bitstream is
// an ordinary scene that happens to have been turned. Nothing here renders.
//
// Two ways to consume one, both first-class:
//   - a static timeline: ObjectScene::evaluate_into(t, out) once per frame,
//     which is what every batch encode above does today;
//   - a live stream: SceneCursor, which is that same timeline with per-object
//     overrides an external source pushes in as they arrive. The OSC/MIDI/
//     controller source is meant to land on that seam without the scene type
//     itself changing shape.

// ceiling rather than leaving the room: OAMD has no coordinates outside it.
