// Per-object placement as a function of time. AtmosEncoder::encode_frame
// already takes a fresh ObjectPlacement every call and ramps the bed
// internally between them; what was missing was a shared way to say WHERE an
// object is at a given moment, so callers stop reimplementing that
// per-frame math independently. Scoped to authored/batch motion - the
// evaluate(time_s) shape is deliberately time-based so a future live-driven
// cursor could reuse it, but that plumbing is not built here.

// parameters, and TS 103 420 sends them per metadata update, so a growing
// object is expressible on both sides. `snap`, `zone` and `enable_elevation`
// do not: they are discrete rendering decisions with no meaningful halfway
// point, so evaluate() holds the EARLIER keyframe's value until the later one
