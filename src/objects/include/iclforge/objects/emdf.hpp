// The Extensible Metadata Delivery Format - ETSI TS 102 366 Annex H. A/52:2018
// Annex H defers to it wholesale rather than restating it, so this is the one
// piece of the bitstream whose authority is the ETSI text.
//
// EMDF is the sanctioned way to put data an AC-3 decoder has never heard of
// into an AC-3 or E-AC-3 frame. §H.1 places the container in a reserved space -
// it names auxdata and the per-block skip fields - so a decoder that knows
// nothing about it reads the frame exactly as it did before. That is precisely
// what makes Dolby Atmos in DD+ backward compatible: the object metadata rides
// here, not as extra coded channels, and a plain 5.1 decoder is untouched.
//
// Nothing in the container is codec state. It is a length-prefixed bag of
// identified payloads, so this module knows only how to pack bits, and the
// OAMD and JOC payload writers know nothing about where they end up.
