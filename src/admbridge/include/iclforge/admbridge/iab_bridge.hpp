// Roadmap item IM1 phase 3 of 3 ("IAB (SMPTE ST 2098-2) reader"): maps the parsed
// IAB bed/object graph (iclforge::iab, phases 1-2) onto iclforge::ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder's input
// shape - one iclforge::oba::ObjectPath plus one mono PCM buffer per bed speaker feed or dynamic
// object, the same destination shape build() (bridge.hpp) already produces for ADM. This is still
// the one place iclforge::iab and iclforge::ac3/iclforge::oba are allowed to meet - see
// bridge.hpp's own top comment on why that boundary exists - just a second source feeding it. Gated
// by the same ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM flag as the rest of iclforge::admbridge (this module's own
// CMakeLists.txt has the full reasoning); ICLFORGE_BUILD_IAB (default ON) is a separate,
// always-satisfied prerequisite this module's own CMakeLists.txt now enforces with a FATAL_ERROR
// guard.
//
// What is structurally different from build()'s own ADM mapping, and why:
//
//   - IAB has no whole-file object graph the way ADM's audioProgramme->audioContent->audioObject
//     tree does - it is a flat SEQUENCE of self-contained IAFrames, each carrying its own
//     Bed/Object metadata scoped to that frame alone (§9.2/§9.4). build_iab() therefore takes the
//     WHOLE parsed frame sequence (std::span<const iclforge::iab::IABitstreamFrame>, exactly what
//     iclforge::iab::parse_iabitstream()/parse_mxf_iab() already return) rather than one
//     already-resolved document, and does its own two-pass walk: an identity pass unions every
//     unconditionally- Activated top-level Bed channel / Object across every frame, keyed by
//     §10.3.1's own MetaID
//     ("the ID that allows the system to track metadata information between audio
//     frames"/"Elements with the same ElementID and MetaID in contiguous IAFrames typically
//     represent continuous audio" - for a Bed channel, combined with its own ChannelID per
//     §10.3.5's note on ST 2098-1's Channel Identifier function) - fixing AtmosEncoder's channel
//     count and order once, the same role collect_leaf_objects() plays for build()'s own ADM walk.
//     A timeline pass then builds one iclforge::oba::ObjectPath per identity spanning the WHOLE
//     sequence: a frame where that identity is absent, or only conditionally Activated (an
//     alternate-target-environment mix per §10.3.2/§10.5.1's own Activation/UseCase fields - the
//     same "pick the one primary set" choice build() already makes among several audioProgrammes),
//     contributes no new keyframe (silence-filled PCM, the timeline simply holds/interpolates
//     through the gap) rather than shrinking the channel count.
//   - Bed channels have no per-block position data at all (unlike ADM's audioBlockFormat
//     sequence) - a Bed's own ChannelID (Table 19) is a closed, physical-position vocabulary
//     resolved once via iclforge::oba::bed_label_position(), the same "pinned, unmoving placement"
//     bed channels already get from ADM's speakerLabel; only BedChannel::gain (§10.3.8) can
//     legitimately vary frame to frame, so a bed channel's timeline is one keyframe per frame it is
//     present in. An LFE bed channel (ChannelID 0xD, or 0x86/0x87's BS.2051-2 LFE1/LFE2 aliases) is
//     routed at gain 0 / lfe_send 1, the exact convention build_channel_path's own doc comment
//     states for ADM ("Objects never reach the LFE by panning").
//   - Table 19's cinema channel vocabulary is richer than iclforge::oba::BedLabel's own
//   consumer-layout
//     one in exactly one place: it names THREE distinct surround zones per side (Side Surround,
//     Surround, Rear Surround) where BedLabel has only two slots (kLs/kRs, kLb/kRb). "Surround"
//     (0x6/0xA) maps to kLs/kRs (the canonical 5.1 pair) and "Rear Surround" (0x7/0x8) to kLb/kRb
//     (7.1's additional back pair, the closest conceptual match); "Side Surround" (0x5/0x9) has no
//     equivalent and is refused - BridgeError::kUnsupportedIabChannel, not silently collapsed onto
//     an existing slot, the same "refuse clearly" precedent bridge.hpp's own top comment states for
//     ADM's unsupported pack types. Several other Table 19 codes (Left/Right Center, Center Height,
//     the *Height variants of Side/Rear Surround, Left/Right Top Surround, Top Surround, and the
//     whole 0x18-0x7F D-Cinema-reserved range) are refused the same way, deliberately, rather than
//     guessed at without the external documents Table 19 itself defers to (SMPTE ST 428-12/
//     ST 2098-5) for their exact geometry - see iab_bridge.cpp's own mapping table for the full,
//     cited list of what IS mapped.
//   - ObjectSpread (§10.5.15-17) becomes the keyframe's ObjectSize (iab_spread_to_size()), and the
//     object's zone control (the nine zones of §10.5.11-14, or the 19 of an ObjectZoneDefinition19
//     child, which replaces them, §10.6) becomes its ZoneConstraint and b_enable_elevation
//     (iab_zones_to_constraint(), iab_zones19_to_constraint()). Both are transmitted in OAMD and
//     stop there, exactly as the ADM bridge's width, height and depth do: AtmosEncoder folds each
//     object into its 5.1 bed as a point, because spreading it there would have the receiving
//     renderer spread it a second time. A zone control maps only when its include/exclude pattern
//     is exactly one of TS 103 420 Table 20's six presets; any other pattern leaves the object
//     unconstrained. A zone19 update in a sub block with no pan information has no keyframe to
//     ride on and takes effect at the next sub block that has one.
//   - PCM is concatenated across many independently-parsed frames, so IabBridgeResult::pcm is
//     OWNED (std::vector<std::vector<float>>), not borrowed the way BridgeResult::pcm is from a
//     single caller-owned AdmDocument - there is no equivalent single upstream object here to
//     borrow spans from once this function returns. This is the one reason IabBridgeResult is a
//     new struct rather than a reuse of BridgeResult, even though every other field lines up.
