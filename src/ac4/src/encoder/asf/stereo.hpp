// Stereo processing for a channel pair coded with one sf_info() (ETSI TS 103
// 190-1 V1.4.1 stereo_data() with b_enable_mdct_stereo_proc, Table 23, and
// chparam_info() and sap_data(), Tables 47 and 48). Clause 5.3.2's matrix
// turns the two tracks X0 and X1 back into L and R, per band:
//
//   left and right   L = X0,               R = X1
//   M/S              L = X0 + X1,          R = X0 - X1
//   prediction       L = (1 + a) X0 + X1,  R = (1 - a) X0 - X1
//
// with a = 0.1 alpha_q. So M/S sends M = (L + R)/2 and S = (L - R)/2, and the
// prediction sends M and the part of S that a M does not predict, S - a M,
// with a chosen per pair of bands to leave the least of S behind. A panned
// source is predicted whole: its S is a multiple of its M.
//
// A band's cost is its perceptual entropy: the bits a band needs grow with
// log2 of its energy over the noise it may carry. Noise in the tracks reaches
// the outputs through the matrix, so each track's allowance is the smaller of
// the two outputs' allowances over the gain to it. Both tracks' noise adds in
// each output, 3 dB over that allowance at most; halving it instead cost the
// race 1 dB of SNR on music at 192 kbps. Each frame takes the sap_mode whose
// bands and side information cost least.
