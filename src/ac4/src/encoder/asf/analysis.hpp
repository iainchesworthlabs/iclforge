// The forward transform of each block of a frame, windowed as the decoder's
// synthesis windows it (ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1 clause 5.5.2.2, Pseudocodes
// 63 and 64): over a block's first half the left window of the shorter of it
// and the block before, over its second half the right window of the shorter
// of it and the block after, each widened with zeros and ones to the block's
// length.
//
// Placement: with the frame's blocks laid end to end from the frame's first
// output sample, a block of n samples that starts k samples into the frame
// transforms the 2n samples from k + (N - n)/2, N being the frame's length.
// Those are what the decoder's overlap-add puts back at the same places.
//
// Scale: the decoder's inverse transform returns a windowed round trip at
// half gain, and writes full scale 1.0 at 32 768 (src/ac4/ERRATA.md, "Full
// scale, and the overlap-add's factor of two"), so the lines are the forward
// transform of the windowed samples times 65 536.
