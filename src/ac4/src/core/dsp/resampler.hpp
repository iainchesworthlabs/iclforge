// The sample rate converter of ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1 clause 6.2.15, and the
// same converter the other way round, which the encoder uses. At every
// frame_rate_index but 13 a frame is coded at an internal rate (46 080 Hz for
// 24 and 30 fps, 46 033.97 Hz for 23.976 and 29.97, 51 200 Hz for 25) and the
// decoder converts by the resampling ratio of Tables 83 and 84: 25/24,
// 1001/1000 x 25/24 = 1001/960, or 15/16. The encoder converts by the inverse.
//
// Part 1 asks only for "high-quality anti-aliasing filters". This one is a
// Kaiser-windowed sinc, polyphase, with every phase the ratio needs tabulated
// (up phases of taps() coefficients, one for each position an output sample
// can take between two input samples): the passband runs to 0.86 of the lower
// rate's Nyquist frequency (19.8 kHz at 46 080 Hz, 20.6 kHz at 48 kHz), the
// stopband starts at that Nyquist frequency, and the stopband is 100 dB down,
// which puts the passband ripple near 0.0001 dB. Each phase sums to 1, so a
// constant passes unchanged. tests/ac4/core/test_ac4core_resampler.cpp
// measures the ripple, the attenuation and the sample counts.
//
// The output grid. Output sample m (from 0) is complete once (m + 1) * down /
// up input samples have arrived, so after n input samples there are exactly
// floor(n * up / down) outputs. Frame by frame, frame t of N input samples
// gives floor((t + 1) R) - floor(t R) outputs, R = N * up / down: at 29.97 fps
// 1 601, 1 602, 1 601, 1 602 and 1 602 in turn, the sequence Part 2 clause
// 5.11 (Table 47) locks to sequence_counter. A converter reset as if `t`
// frames had passed (reset(t * N)) starts that sequence at its phase t.
//
// Output m stands for the input at (m + 1) * down / up - 1 - taps() / 2 input
// samples, so the converter delays by taps() / 2 + 1 - down / up input
// samples, a fraction of a sample included (delay()).
//
// The scalar. The table is designed in double, whatever it is kept in: the
// window, the sinc and each phase's normalisation are computed at double, and
// a filter whose Coefficient is float rounds each phase to float once. A
// converter that runs at float (the decoder in the float tier, on the
// ESP32-P4, whose FPU is single precision and where a double multiply and
// add is a call to a software routine) sums float products of float history
// over four lanes in an order fixed in dsp/resampler_vector.hpp, so its output
// is the same float on every platform; a converter at double, the encoder's
// and the decoder's in the default build, sums double products of the double
// table in the order of the taps, as it always did (planning/ac4.md, D14a4).
//
// Where the table comes from. At double the filter designs its table when it
// is made, with the C library's sin and sqrt, as it always has. At float the
// decoder's three ratios, 25/24, 15/16 and 1001/960, are tables the compiler
// built (dsp/resampler_design.hpp, with the portable functions of
// dsp/portable_math.hpp), data in the program's read-only memory that the
// filter copies when it is made: nothing is designed on a part that has no use
// for the time it takes (5.9 s at 1001/960 on the ESP32-P4's soft-float
// double) and the same coefficients are on every platform. The copy is for a
// part that executes from flash behind a cache, where reading a table the
// cache cannot hold from the constants is several times slower than reading it
// from the heap (src/ac4/src/core/dsp/resampler.cpp has the figures). The tables
// hold phases 0 to up / 2: phase up - p is phase p read from its last coefficient
// to its first, so that is half of each, 188 KB at 1001/960, and phase() says
// which way to read (planning/ac4.md, D14a5). Any other ratio at float is
// designed when the filter is made, with the same functions, and kept the same
// way.
//
// At Fixed32 (planning/ac4.md, D14d) the table is kept in Q1.30, the compiler's for the three
// ratios as at float, and an output is the sum of the products of the coefficients and the
// history's raw values in 64 bits, rounded once. The ESP32-C6 that tier is for has 512 KB of SRAM
// shared with its Wi-Fi and no PSRAM: a table of up to kResamplerCopyLimit bytes is copied, as at
// float (25/24's is 4,888 bytes and 15/16's 3,200), and a longer one is read where it is, in
// flash (1001/960's, 188,376 bytes).
