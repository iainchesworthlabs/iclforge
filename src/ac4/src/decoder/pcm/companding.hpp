// The companding tool: ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1 clause 5.7.5. It expands, in
// the QMF domain, what the encoder compressed: each slot of an A-SPX interval
// is scaled by g(ts) * G, g(ts) = L(ts)^((1 - alpha) / alpha) with L(ts) the
// slot's mean absolute level over the companded subbands, alpha = 0.65 and G
// = 2^(1 / alpha); or by one gain from the interval's average; or not at all.
// The gain depends on the level's scale. The QMF domain runs at the inverse
// transform's, full scale 2^15, where A-SPX's envelopes are measured; the
// levels here are measured against full scale 1.0 (src/ac4dec/ERRATA.md,
// "Companding measures against full scale 1.0").
