// The audio spectral frontend's reconstruction, ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1
// clause 5.1, from what D1's sf_data() reading kept (syntax/asf.hpp):
// quantisation reconstruction and scaling (5.1.3, Pseudocode 21), spectral
// noise fill (5.1.4, Pseudocodes 22 and 23) and ungrouping (5.1.5,
// Pseudocode 25).
//
// Lines stay in bitstream order - by window group, then scale factor band,
// then window, then line, the order quant_spec holds them in - until
// ungroup(), so that a scale factor band of a group is one contiguous run,
// as the stereo processing of clause 5.3 wants it.

// for every scale factor band of every frame. The same call with the same argument
// gives the same value on every platform's C library as it always did, so the
// output moves by no bit; the call costs a hundred operations of the compiler's
// software `double` on a part whose FPU is single precision, and a stream of 5.1
// makes 250 of them a frame (planning/ac4.md, D14e).
