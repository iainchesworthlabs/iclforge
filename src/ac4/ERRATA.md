# AC-4: errata and readings

Where ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1 (Part 1) and ETSI TS 103 190-2 V1.3.1 (Part 2) contradict themselves,
leave a case open or print a defect, and the reading the library takes for each: the decoder's, then
the encoder's.

## The decoder

The places where ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1 (Part 1) and ETSI TS 103 190-2 V1.3.1 (Part 2) contradict
themselves, leave a case open or print a defect, and the reading this decoder takes for each. Page
numbers are the printed ones, which equal the PDF page numbers; tables whose extracted text was unclear
were read on a rendering of the page.

The syntax is transcribed twice: in C++ here, and in Python in `tools/references/ac4_syntax.py`,
written separately from the text. Where an entry says "both", the two transcriptions take the same
reading. The evidence for a reading is one of:

- **Streams**: encoded streams reach the syntax. Both transcriptions read every frame of the 107 local
  census streams (50,728 frames of DEE 6.5.4 output), of the committed streams, and of the public
  channel-based streams from DASH-IF, CTA WAVE and Chromium (6,670 frames from other Dolby encoders) to
  the end of every substream, with every size check holding, and their traces agree. Since phase D9
  that includes the 5.1.4 audio of the gold set's 22 legs and the census's 12 5.1.4 encodes (10,866
  frames).
- **Text**: no stream here reaches the syntax. Both transcriptions take the reading, and their traces
  agree where the differential check (see the end of this page) reaches it, which shows they read it
  alike; whether the reading is the intended one rests on the text.
- **Observation**: the text says nothing; the encoded streams decide.

Phases D2 to D10 added the readings their processing needs, under their own headings below. A
reading only a writer needs is in `src/ac4/ERRATA.md`, which points back here wherever the decoder
depends on the same reading.

### Table of contents and presentations

#### presentation_config 1 and 4 read more specifiers than n_substream_groups

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.1.3, p. 115.
- **Text:** "Main + DE" (1) reads two `ac4_sgi_specifier()` and sets `n_substream_groups = 1`; "Main +
  DE + Associated Audio" (4) reads three and sets 2.
- **Reading:** the specifiers are read as the syntax says. `n_substream_groups` keeps the assigned value
  where it is used as a count (the `sg_gain` loop of `ac4_presentation_substream()`), while
  `pres_ch_mode`, `pres_ch_mode_core`, `n_substreams_in_presentation` and the other presentation helpers
  are taken over every group the specifiers name. Pseudocode 25 loops to `n_substream_groups`, which
  would leave out the associated audio of configuration 4; clauses 6.3.3.1.29 to 6.3.3.1.31 define the
  helpers over "all substreams in the presentation".
- **Evidence:** Text. The inspector (`src/ac4`) and the Python parser had read one specifier too few;
  `tests/ac4/core/test_presentation_configs.cpp` builds both configurations.

#### presentation_version 2 is read as immersive stereo

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.2.3.1, p. 158: a decoder "shall decode a presentation if its presentation version
  is 1 or 2". Nothing else in V1.3.1 defines version 2.
- **Observed:** every DEE immersive-stereo encode here (`dee_ac4ims_encoder`: the census's 22 and the
  three committed, at 23.976, 24, 25 and 29.97 fps) is presentation_version 2 over one channel-coded
  substream whose `ac4_substream_info_chan()` carries `channel_mode` 0b1111000, which Table 56 (p. 160)
  gives to 7.0 (3/4/0). Read as 7.0, `metadata()` fails its `tools_metadata_size` check in I-frames, the
  presentation substream reads one bit past its end, and the audio fails in its section data. Read as
  stereo, every frame of every stream ends exactly.
- **Reading:** in a presentation_version 2 presentation, a channel-coded substream with that code is
  stereo wherever its channel mode is used: its channel element, its `metadata()` and the
  presentation's `pres_ch_mode`.
- **Evidence:** Observation.

#### The frame rate factor of a substream group

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.1.8, p. 118: `ac4_substream_info_chan()` loops `b_audio_ndot` over
  `frame_rate_factor`, which `frame_rate_multiply_info()` sets per presentation, while the substream
  groups are read after every presentation.
- **Reading:** every group takes the factor of the first presentation that transmits
  `frame_rate_multiply_info()`; an EMDF-only presentation (configuration 6) transmits none and is passed
  over. Both transcriptions read it so. The text leaves open which factor applies when presentations
  carry different ones, and no stream here does. With a factor above 1,
  `substream_index` names the first of that many consecutive substreams (Part 1 4.3.3.7.9, p. 79),
  and both transcriptions read each as an instance of its own, with that instance's `b_audio_ndot`.
- **The series, not the instance, is what carries state.** 4.3.3.5.3, p. 76, has the substreams of a
  series decoded consecutively, and 4.3.3.2.7, p. 74, fulfils `b_iframe_global` when the **first**
  `b_iframe` of a series of 2 or 4 is true, so a stream whose I-frames set only that first flag is legal.
  The configuration an I-frame of the series sends therefore serves the instances after it, and each
  instance predicts from the one before: one slot of carried state per series, the first instance's. A
  slot per instance leaves every instance after the first with a configuration no I-frame ever sent, and
  every frame of such a stream fails as missing its I-frame.
- **Each instance covers `frame_len_base / frame_rate_factor` samples.** Tables 83 and 87 leave no other
  reading: every (index, factor) pair Table 87 permits lands on another index's listed length - 2048 at
  25 fps doubled is 1024, the 50 fps entry; 1536 quadrupled is 384 - and the base length would put two
  or four frames' samples into one frame period. The length sets transform lengths and the widths taken
  from them (`max_sfb` among them), so an instance read at the base length is misread, not mis-scaled.
- **Evidence:** Streams for factor 1 (every stream here); Text above it. The differential check's
  synthetic frames carry factor 2 and 4, which is where the two transcriptions meet this path at all:
  with one side reading an instance at the base length, that check reports the `max_sfb` width
  differing.

#### A frame rate the sample rate does not define

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 83, p. 74, gives `frame_len_base` for each `frame_rate_index` at 48 kHz;
  Table 84, p. 74, covers 44.1 kHz and defines index 13 alone, leaving every other index reserved there.
- **Reading:** such a frame has no frame length, so nothing in it that derives from one is read: every
  audio substream and the presentation substream are refused for a reserved `frame_rate_index`, rather
  than read with the 48 kHz length or read until a field that needs the length is reached.
  `iclforge::ac4::samples_per_frame()` reads the pair the same way. Both transcriptions derive the length in one
  place, which is what keeps the audio and presentation substreams of a frame on the same value.
- **Evidence:** Text; every stream here is 48 kHz.

#### The efficient high frame rate mode

- **Where:** Part 2 5.1.3, pp. 56 and 57, Figures 7 and 8, Table 18, and 5.11, p. 111. Above 30 fps a
  presentation may transmit `frame_rate_fraction` 2 or 4: the codec frame is that many transmission frames
  long, each `raw_ac4_frame()` carries a fragment of each substream, the presentation substream whole in
  the first and elided in the others. A decoder keeps a FIFO and "reassembles the frame by concatenating all
  the `ac4_substream_data` fragments that are referenced in the selected presentation".
- **Reading:**
  - The fraction is the selected presentation's. The presentation is selected on the table of contents of
    the first frame of a unit as if every fraction were 1, which is how the unit will read; a presentation of
    another fraction in the same frame stays a set of fragments and is refused as before.
  - A unit is the frames from one whose `sequence_counter` is a multiple of the fraction to the one before
    the next (Figure 8). Its table of contents is the first frame's, with Table 18's `frame_rate_index` and a
    fraction of 1. The text does not say which counter the codec frame has, and 5.11 locks the sample rate
    converter's phase to "the sequence_counter"; the codec frame's is the first frame's counter divided by the
    fraction, which steps by one from unit to unit, as the counter of a stream of that audio frame rate does,
    and keeps a first frame of 0 (the splice mark) at 0. Read as the first frame's own counter, the phase
    would step by the fraction and the 1 601 and 1 602 sample frames of 29.97 fps would come in another
    order.
  - Every substream of the frame is concatenated, not only those of the selected presentation, since the
    others cost nothing to join; all frames of a unit must have the first's `n_substreams`.
  - Continuity (Part 1 4.3.3.2.2) is checked on the transmission counters, one frame at a time, so a lost
    frame is a change of source, which drops the unit being assembled. A frame that cannot be read inside a
    unit counts as a fragment lost: the unit ends as lost at its last frame, and `decode()` conceals it
    (Figure 8's "conceal and dequeue"). A frame that is not the first of a unit, with no first frame held (the
    decoder joined part way through a unit), is dropped without concealment.
  - `decode()` returns no frame for a fragment other than the unit's last. `parse()` gives a report with no
    substreams for it, and the unit's for the last.
- **Evidence:** Text; no stream here uses the mode. `tests/ac4/decoder/test_ehfr.cpp` cuts DEE's immersive
  stereo streams at 24, 25 and 29.97 fps into fragments at each fraction Table 18 gives them, and the decoder's
  PCM for each unit equals the uncut stream's for its frame, sample for sample. That holds the framing and the
  counter reading; it cannot say how an encoder splits a substream. Fragments are cut by the test at equal
  lengths; the text allows zero-length ones and any other split, which the concatenation does not depend on.

#### The speech spectral frontend

- **Where:** Part 1 4.2.9 (Tables 43 to 46), 4.3.7 (Tables 111 to 113, Pseudocode 7), 5.2
  (Pseudocodes 4a to 58) and Annex C, whose tables are in the attachment ts_103190_tables.c except
  Table C.1. The decoder reads and decodes it in one pass (`src/ac4/src/decoder/syntax/ssf.cpp`), since
  `ssf_ac_data()` has no length, and the allocation its arithmetic decoder needs comes from values the
  decoding builds. `tools/references/ssf_ref.py` is a second transcription, written from the text without
  reading the first; they agree on random streams (below). The text is defective in the places that follow.
- **Readings:**
  1. Pseudocode 50 calls `AcDecodeSymbolExtCdf(..., 0, i_max_idx)`, a search that "cannot return a
     negative value" for signed indices. A coefficient's symbols run from `-i_max_idx` to `i_max_idx`,
     ascending, the first whose interval holds the target; any larger range gives the same symbol, since
     the intervals that hold nothing are empty. For the envelope and predictor gain tables, of 33 entries
     (32 symbols), the call's upper bound of 32 would read `table[33]`: the symbols are 0 to 31.
  2. Pseudocode 51 clamps `iLeft` from below and `iRight` from above only, so a symbol wholly beyond
     +-10 makes `CdfEst()` index outside CDF_TABLE. Both ends are clamped to +-327680; such a symbol's
     interval is empty. The table's tails (47 and 46 in 32 768 beyond +-10) are therefore never
     decoded: no valid stream puts a symbol there.
  3. Pseudocode 27 gives `HeuristicScaling()` f_rfu "in Qx.10" and never converts it. It is rounded:
     `floor(f_rfu * 1024 + 0.5)`. Truncation would change a band's weight in about 4 % of random sets
     of an envelope and a predictor gain (measured), and with it the allocation, so which bits of the
     arithmetic coded data are read; no stream here settles it.
  4. Pseudocode 28 does not reset `band` before the reverse water-filling, which it enters with
     `num_bands`, so the loop would not run. It is reset to 0.
  5. Pseudocodes 56 and 57 write `x = x++`: an increment, as in "x = x++ in Pseudocode 57" above.
  6. Pseudocode C.1's index `(nu + rfs) * rts * 33 + k * 33 + eta` does not match the arrays, which
     are smooth along eta only with eta as the middle index and k the fastest, the index being
     `((nu + rfs) * 33 + eta) * rts + k` (for each of the 37 arrays with Rt > 1 the second differences
     along eta are at least 6 times smaller than in any other order; `tools/generators/gen_ac4_tables.py`
     checks it).
  7. Pseudocode 36's sign (`s`, never initialised, toggling inside the loops) is replaced by the displayed
     equation of 5.2.6, `(-1)^((k + 1) p)`, and `round()` by `floor(x + 1/2)` as the equations have it.
     The two differ only for a negative exact half, which one coefficient at predictor lag index 509 and a
     block length of 960 reaches.
  8. Pseudocode 4e's `(i_pred_lag_idx - 509) / 170` is a real division.
  9. Pseudocode 41 names the large threshold `SSF_SSF_THRESHOLD_LARGE` and uses `SSF_THRESHOLD_LARGE`:
     1 << 29, the initial range of Pseudocode 43.
  10. `FLOAT()` in Pseudocode 27 is a division by 1024.
  11. `AcDecodeFinish()` (Pseudocode 47) counts the bits the arithmetic decoder has read since its
      initialisation, less the 30 it reads ahead, plus the termination length it finds: that is where
      the next granule starts. The decoder's own reads beyond the substream are zeros; a count that
      ends beyond it is a truncated substream.
  12. An SSF-I-frame (`b_iframe`, or `b_ssf_iframe` for the first granule) starts both random generators
      (Pseudocode 55), `i_prev_pred_lag_idx` and the predictor's buffers afresh. The second granule of a
      frame is never an I granule. The dither of a granule is drawn up front (Pseudocode 58), the noise
      as the lines are dequantised, in block, band and bin order. A stream that fails to decode needs the
      next I-frame.
  13. The predictor's spectra buffers keep the lines of the length they were written at; when the block
      length changes between granules they are cut or zero extended to the new `num_bins`. The text
      says nothing on a change of stride.
  14. A subband predictor with a gain of 0 produces zeros without being run; with a gain, a lag that
      reaches an envelope buffer entry no block has filled (the first blocks after an I-frame), or past
      the four entries, is an invalid stream rather than a division by zero.
  15. The fixed point arithmetic of Pseudocodes 4b and 27 to 30 and 40 to 53 is held in 64 bits and a
      result outside int32 is an invalid stream (the macros would wrap). The state of the arithmetic
      decoder is uint32 and wraps, as the unsigned types do: a random stream breaks `offset < range`
      half the time, and both transcriptions then run on with wrapped arithmetic.
  16. A stream is invalid where an envelope leaves -64 to 63 (the NOTE of 5.2.3.0a), a predictor lag index
      leaves 0 to 509 (the NOTE of 5.2.4.0a), a short stride is sent where Table 112 allows none
      (frame lengths of 512 and 384), or a symbol's interval holds nothing the arithmetic decoder asks for.
  17. The lines are the inverse MDCT's input in the scale of the audio spectral frontend's, and a granule's
      blocks (768, or 4 of 192, and so on) are the transform blocks Table 187 lists.
- **Evidence:** Text. No stream here uses the tool: not DEE's, not the census's, not the third-party ones.
  `tests/golden/ac4/ssf/ssf-vectors.txt` is 128 frames of random bytes through the reference
  (`python tools/references/ssf_ref.py vectors --seed 1 --cases 32 --frames 4`), which the decoder matches
  on the bits ssf_data() took, every granule's stride and band count, and every line to 1e-9; five
  deliberate changes (the rounding of f_rfu, the predictor's sign, a dB table's shift, the termination
  count, an integer division) each fail it. Random bits are not a stream a codec wrote, so the readings
  above that depend on one (3, 11, 13) are not tested by it.

#### A substream named by several elements

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 15, p. 33, and Part 2 Table 50, p. 123: the element that names a substream's
  index decides which syntax the substream holds. Nothing forbids two elements naming one index.
- **Reading:** a substream is read once per frame, as the first element names it, in this order: every
  presentation's EMDF payload substreams and presentation substream, then the substream groups in the
  order the presentations reference them. A stream that names one substream twice is malformed; the
  order only makes the two transcriptions read such a stream alike.
- **Evidence:** Text; no stream here names a substream twice.

#### A substream group named twice by one presentation

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.1.3, p. 115: a presentation reads its `ac4_sgi_specifier()` elements in turn, and
  nothing forbids two of them naming one `group_index`. Clauses 6.3.3.1.13 (p. 168) and 6.3.3.1.27 to
  6.3.3.1.31 (pp. 170 to 173) define `n_substreams_in_presentation`, `pres_ch_mode` and the other helpers
  over the substreams in the presentation.
- **Reading:** a group named twice holds the same substreams both times, so it counts once, in the
  helpers and in the substream assignment alike. `n_substream_groups`, which 6.2.1.3 assigns and the
  `sg_gain` loop of `ac4_presentation_substream()` uses as a count, keeps the value the clause gives it.
- **Evidence:** Text; no stream here names a group twice. Counting per reference also made a frame that
  names one group thousands of times cost one walk of that group per reference, which is a way to make a
  40 KB frame take a billion iterations.

#### A change of source

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.2.2, p. 72: a frame continues the stream when its `sequence_counter` is the
  previous frame's plus 1, wraps from 1020 to 1, or follows a 0, which a splicing device writes into the
  first frame after a splice; anything else is a change of source, over which a decoding system "should
  provide continuity of audio experience" until the next independently decodable frame. Part 1 6.2.19, p.
  272: a switch of streams at an I-frame "shall produce a flawless output", and the decoder "shall use this splice indication to ignore any
  information from previous frames when decoding the first frame after a splice". Part 2 5.11, p. 110,
  delays a change in the converter's phase "with the signal" until the new source's first sample
  reaches the converter's output.
- **Reading:** a change of source forgets what was read from the stream: I-frame configuration, A-SPX
  offsets and borders, DRC and dialogue enhancement configuration, and the values A-SPX's and A-CPL's
  differences along time start from. A frame that needs configuration before the next I-frame fails as
  missing its I-frame. The signal carries on: the overlap, the frame alignment's delay line, the QMF
  banks and their history, A-SPX's generators, A-CPL's decorrelators, the output stages and the
  converter. The old stream's audio comes out to its end and overlaps the new stream's first frame,
  which is what makes a switch at an I-frame flawless and gives 5.11's delay a signal to travel with. A
  frame that returns nothing while it waits for an I-frame drops the signal, so the frame decoded after
  the wait starts from silence rather than from audio a gap old; under a concealment policy the wait is
  concealed instead. A frame whose table of contents does not read is taken to be the frame the stream
  expected: its counter is the previous one plus 1 (after a 0, any counter but 0 continues, and still
  does), and phi_t moves on with it. The text does not say whether an unreadable frame counts. Taking it
  as the expected frame keeps one damaged frame from costing every frame up to the next I-frame, and the
  checks of "Configuration belongs to the codec mode it was sent for" still refuse a frame that needed
  an I-frame the damage took.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE starts counting at 1019, so every stream here passes the wrap to 1 in its
  third frame. `tests/ac4/decoder/test_decoder.cpp` splices DEE streams at an I-frame, marked 0 and
  with the counter jumping, and between I-frames: the output is the first stream's decoded alone up to
  the joint and the second's decoded alone from the frame after it. Text for the frame that does not
  parse.

#### oamd_common_data() at both its call sites

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.8.1, embedded by `b_oamd_common_data_present` in both `ac4_substream_info_ajoc()`
  (§6.2.1.9, a TOC-level element) and `oamd_substream()` (§6.2.2.4, the OAMD substream).
- **Reading:** both are read. The first, at the TOC level, by the inspector (`ac4::`/`ac4_parse.py`), since a
  wrong reading there desyncs every substream after it; the second, since phase D10, by the decoder and
  `ac4_syntax.py`, with a record per element. What the two carry applies to the group's objects; where a
  frame carries both, the OAMD substream's, read after the table of contents, is the one in force, and
  either holds until a frame sends another ("Object audio metadata", below).
- **Evidence:** Text. Chromium's `ac4-ajoc.ac4` sends the TOC's in every frame with the default screen size
  ratio and no additional data, and has no OAMD substream; the constructed object streams of
  `tests/ac4/decoder/objects.cpp` send both, with trim, bed render and headphone data.

#### n_objects_code and the LFE

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.1.11 and Table 60 (§6.3.2.10.2), p. 162; §6.2.3.2 `audio_data_objs()` and its NOTE
  1 (§6.2.2.2).
- **Text:** the syntax sets `num_objects = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7][n_objects_code]` and, with
  `b_dynamic_objects`, loops over `num_objects` objects, the first an LFE where `b_lfe` is set. Table 60
  gives `n_objects` as `b_lfe`, `1 + b_lfe`, `2 + b_lfe`, `3 + b_lfe` and `5 + b_lfe` for codes 0 to 4, and
  reserves 5 to 7. `audio_data_objs(n_objects, b_lfe, b_iframe)` reads the LFE's `mono_data(1)` and then
  the element `objs_to_channel_mode(n_objects)` names, which has cases for 1, 2, 3 and 5 only.
- **Reading:** Table 60's. The substream codes `[0, 1, 2, 3, 5][n_objects_code]` objects in its element,
  which is what `audio_data_objs()` takes as `n_objects`, and the LFE on top of them: with
  `b_dynamic_objects` and `b_lfe` the objects are the LFE, listed first as the syntax's loop has it, and
  then that many dynamic objects. Codes 5 to 7 name no objects, the LFE included, and a substream that
  sends one is refused as invalid.
- **Why:** under the syntax's count, a 5.1 set of dynamic objects (code 4 with `b_lfe`) would put four
  fullband objects in an element, which no channel element carries, and code 5's seven objects have no
  element either; `audio_data_objs()` codes the LFE outside the element, so the element's count excludes
  it.
- **Evidence:** Text. The inspector (`src/ac4`) and `ac4_parse.py` had followed the syntax's count;
  `tests/ac4/core/test_toc.cpp` and `test_toc_syntax.cpp` hold the table's.

#### bits_used from trim()/bed_render_info()/headphone() is measured, not returned

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.8.1: `bits_used = trim(); add_data_bits = add_data_bits - bits_used;` and the
  same for `bed_render_info()` and `headphone()`, three calls whose own syntax tables (§6.2.8.8, 6.2.8.9,
  6.2.8.9a) read fields in the ordinary way and state no return value.
- **Reading:** `bits_used` is the reader position immediately after the call minus the position
  immediately before it - what each function actually read, not a quantity it computes and returns. The
  same holds for the three other elements whose value the syntax subtracts from a budget: `ajoc_bed_info()`
  in `audio_data_ajoc()` (§6.2.3.4), `ext_prec_alt_pos()` in `oamd_dyndata_single()` (§6.2.8.3) and
  `add_per_object_md()` in `object_info_block()` (§6.2.8.5), none of which returns anything in its table.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### An add_data budget a nested element overruns fails the substream

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.8.1: `add_data_bits = add_data_bits - bits_used`, unguarded, for all three of
  `trim()`, `bed_render_info()` and `headphone()`; `add_data_bits` then sizes the final `add_data` read.
  The text does not say what a `bits_used` bigger than the remaining `add_data_bits` means.
- **Reading:** a failure: `trim()`/`bed_render_info()`/`headphone()` reading more than `add_data_bytes`
  budgeted them is possible only on a malformed stream (a real encoder sizes `add_data_bytes` to fit
  exactly what it wrote), and letting `add_data` or the fields after `oamd_common_data()` be read from a
  position the budget never actually reserved for them would misparse rather than fail. The same for the
  budgets of the elements the entry above names: `skip_bits` of `ajoc_bed_info()` and `ext_prec_alt_pos()`,
  and `add_table_data_size_minus1` of `add_per_object_md()`. A budget larger than what is left of the
  substream is found before the element is read, and fails as truncated.
- **Evidence:** Text; `tests/ac4/core/test_toc.cpp` covers it with a `trim()` sized past an 8-bit budget.

### Substream framing

#### ac4_substream() byte alignment after audio_size

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 16, p. 33, has a `byte_align` after the `audio_size` header; Part 2 6.2.2.2,
  p. 123, has none.
- **Reading:** either; the header is 16 bits plus 8 for each `variable_bits(7)` group, so the alignment
  reads nothing.

#### audio_size covers the fill

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.4.1, p. 82.
- **Reading:** `metadata()` starts at the first bit of `audio_data()` plus 8 × `audio_size`; what lies
  between the end of `audio_data()` and that point is `fill_bits` and `byte_align`, and `audio_data()`
  reaching past it is a failure.
- **Evidence:** Streams. In every audio substream read, `audio_data()` ended 0 to 7 bits short of that
  point.

#### byte_align is relative to the substream

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.1.3, p. 71: alignment is "relative to the start of the enclosing syntactic
  element".
- **Reading:** every `byte_align` aligns to the start of the substream, including the one that ends an
  `emdf_payloads_substream()` nested in `metadata()`, which starts at an arbitrary bit.
- **Evidence:** Streams. The immersive-stereo streams carry an EMDF payload in `metadata()` in every
  second frame, and every such substream ends exactly.

### ASF

#### sect_sfb_offset at max_sfb

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 4, p. 90, defines `sect_sfb_offset[g][sfb]` for `sfb < max_sfb`, while
  `asf_spectral_data()` (Table 40, p. 46) reads it at `sect_end == max_sfb`.
- **Reading:** the same formula at `sfb == max_sfb`, which is also the next group's start.
- **Evidence:** Streams.

#### sf_info_lfe() below 1536 samples

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 35, p. 42, sets `b_long_frame = 1` with the comment "transform length =
  frame_length" and never sets `transf_length`; Pseudocode 2, p. 87, returns `transf_length` when
  `frame_len_base` is below 1536.
- **Reading:** the LFE transform covers the frame: the index of the whole-frame transform (3 for 1024,
  960 and 768 samples; 2 for 512 and 384).
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### n_sect_bits below 1536 samples

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 39 and Pseudocode 6, p. 91, choose 3 or 5 bits by comparing the
  `transf_length` index with 2.
- **Reading:** as written: index 2 gives 3 bits even where it is the whole-frame transform (512 and
  384 samples).
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### get_max_sfb() with b_dual_maxsfb

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 5, p. 91, returns `max_sfb_side` for `b_dual_maxsfb` only where
  `b_side_channel` is 1, which a note beside it says "indicates the decoding of the side channel";
  4.3.6.2.3, p. 89, makes it the side's count of "transmitted scale factor bands", and clause 5.3.3.2,
  p. 175, gives the stereo matrix per band without saying what it takes where the two tracks send
  different bands.
- **Reading:** in stereo ASPX_ACPL_1 with `b_enable_mdct_stereo_proc`, the `chparam_info()` uses
  `max_sfb`, and the second `sf_data()` uses `max_sfb_side`. The stereo processing runs over the bands
  the `chparam_info()` covers, the first track's, with the side's lines 0 in a band it does not send; a
  band the side sends above the first track's is left as it is. Each track holds its lines group after
  group up to its own count, so the decoder lays the two out alike before the matrix.
- **Evidence:** Text; a constructed stream whose side sends 16 bands to the mid's 22.

#### ext_code is at most 21 bits

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 20, p. 141, reads leading ones without a bound; Table 40, p. 46, gives
  `ext_code` "5…21" bits.
- **Reading:** the escape is `2 * N_ext + 5` bits, so N_ext is at most 8 and a magnitude at most 8191. A
  ninth leading one fails the substream, and nothing is recorded for the escape.
- **Evidence:** Text. `fuzz_ac4_decode` found the unbounded loop within seconds: a shift past 32 bits.

#### Section data outside its range

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.6.3.1, p. 91: `sect_cb` 12 to 15 "shall not be used"; Table 40's loop would pass
  over them.
- **Reading:** a `sect_cb` of 12 to 15, and a section that ends beyond `max_sfb`, fail the substream. The
  two transcriptions detect these at different elements, which changes only where a corrupt
  substream's trace stops.

#### asf_section_data()'s max_sfb, with an active HSF extension

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 39, p. 45, sets `max_sfb = get_max_sfb(g)`. Its own section-splitting branch,
  two lines later (`if (sect_end[g][i] > num_sfb_48(transf_length_g)) { ... }`), can only trigger when
  the loop reads past `num_sfb_48`, which `get_max_sfb(g)` alone never permits: 4.3.6.2.2 gives
  `max_sfb[i]` a ceiling of `num_sfb` (`num_sfb_48`, at this call), so `get_max_sfb(g) <= num_sfb_48`
  always holds. Tables 42a to 42c (`asf_hsf_spectral_data()`, `asf_hsf_scalefac_data()`,
  `asf_hsf_snf_data()`, pp. 48 and 49), read from this channel's `ac4_hsf_ext_substream()`, depend on
  `num_sec_lsf[g] < num_sec[g]` and on `sfb_cb[g][sfb]`/`sect_sfb_offset[g][sfb]` being set for `sfb` up
  to `get_max_sfb_hsf(g)` (4.3.16.2, p. 138) - reachable only if `asf_section_data()` itself reads that
  far.
- **Reading:** `max_sfb` in Table 39's own pseudocode is `get_max_sfb_hsf(g)`, not `get_max_sfb(g)`,
  whenever this channel's HSF extension is active (its `ac4_hsf_ext_substream_info()` links a substream,
  and this channel's own `sf_multiplier` is set - Part 1 Table 89, p. 78). `asf_spectral_data()`,
  `asf_scalefac_data()` and `asf_snf_data()` (Tables 40 to 42) are unaffected: their own `get_max_sfb(g)`
  and `min(get_max_sfb(g), num_sfb_48(...))` calls keep the core-only reading, which is what makes a
  channel with no active extension unaffected byte for byte by touching the section loop at all.
- **Evidence:** The constructed streams under `tests/golden/ac4-hsf/` (`mono-96-long` and the rest,
  built by `tests/ac4/decoder/hsf.cpp` from the text) read the extension's sections to `get_max_sfb_hsf(g)`
  in both transcriptions, and their tones come back at 96 and 192 kHz only through that reading
  (`tests/ac4/decoder/test_hsf.cpp`); no stream from another encoder uses the mode.

#### ac4_hsf_ext_substream()'s max_sfb_ext_hsf and num_channels

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 17, p. 34: `max_sfb_ext_hsf[0]` and, `if (b_different_framing)`, `[1]` are read
  once, before a `for (ch = 0; ch < num_channels; ch++) { sf_hsf_data(); }` loop. Neither
  `b_different_framing` nor `num_channels` is defined in this substream's own syntax; both are properties
  `sf_info()`/`asf_psy_info()` (4.2.7.1, 4.2.8.2) set once per track of the *owning* channel-coded
  substream's own element (`single_channel_element`, `channel_pair_element`, and so on, 4.2.6) - most of
  which read one shared `sf_info()` for every track (3_0, 5_X, 7_X), leaving only a `channel_pair_element`
  without `b_enable_mdct_stereo_proc` able to hold two, one per track.
- **Reading:** `num_channels` is the owning element's own track count, in the order its `sf_data()` calls
  are made (`mono_data()`, `stereo_data()`, `two_channel_data()`, and so on) - the same order and count
  `sf_hsf_data()`'s loop needs to match, LFE and ASPX_ACPL_1 residual tracks included. `b_different_framing`
  is the first of those tracks' own value: every track's `sf_info()` (hence its own `b_different_framing`)
  is read before the element's *first* `sf_data()` call, the point `asf_section_data()` first needs
  `max_sfb_ext_hsf` - the first track's is the only one available to size this header when it must be
  read. A later track whose own `b_different_framing` calls for `max_sfb_ext_hsf[1]` where the first
  track's did not read one takes it as 0: no additional bands for that track's own second half, rather
  than a failure.
- **Evidence:** The same constructed streams: `mono-192-switched-snf` and `stereo-192-sap1-switched` carry
  `b_different_framing` and so `max_sfb_ext_hsf[1]`, and `stereo-96-sap2` and `stereo-192-sap1-switched` are
  pairs whose extension holds one `sf_hsf_data()` per track. The reading of a later track's differing
  `b_different_framing` is Text only: the builder gives every track of an element the same framing.

### Channel elements

#### Configuration belongs to the codec mode it was sent for

- **Where:** Part 1 Tables 20 to 33: each element reads `aspx_config()` and `acpl_config_1ch()` or
  `acpl_config_2ch()` in I-frames, for the codec mode that frame signals; nothing says what a later frame
  in another codec mode uses.
- **Reading:** an I-frame replaces all of an element's configuration, and a frame whose codec mode (or
  element) differs from the last I-frame's, and needs configuration, fails as missing its I-frame. The
  A-SPX offsets and borders carried per A-SPX element position are kept across I-frames of the same
  element and codec mode, and forgotten when either changes.
- **Evidence:** Streams for unchanging modes; Text for a change.

#### ASPX_ACPL_1: the framing of the residuals

- **Where:** Part 1 Tables 25 (5_X, pp. 38 and 39) and 33 (7_X, pp. 41 and 42); 4.3.5.13, p. 84.
- **Text:** ASPX_ACPL_1 reads `max_sfb_master`, two `chparam_info()` and two `sf_data(ASF)`. The notes
  give `max_sfb_master`'s width, n_side_bits of "the largest signalled transform length from" the
  channel data above ("for coding_config == 0, this depends on which channel pair the additional
  channels are derived from"), and 4.3.5.13 maps it to each block's `max_sfb` through Tables B.8 to
  B.19. Nothing names the `sf_info()` whose windows and groups the four elements follow.
- **Reading:** residual *i*, and the `chparam_info()` before it, follow the framing of the track that
  the residual's A-CPL module pairs it with:
  - 5_X: tracks A and B of the channel data (Table 181, p. 180), which Pseudocode 117 (p. 240) pairs
    with the residuals and 5.3.4.3.2's matrix combines with them;
  - 7_X: Table 202 (p. 242) and Pseudocode 120: L and R (tracks A and B) for 5/2/0 and 3/2/2 with
    `add_ch_base` 0; Ls and Rs (tracks D and E) for 3/4/0, and for 5/2/0 and 3/2/2 with `add_ch_base` 1.
    Table 182 (p. 181) places A, B, D and E among the tracks by `coding_config` and `2ch_mode`.

  `max_sfb_master`'s width is n_side_bits of the largest transform length the two tracks' `sf_info()`
  signal. A window group of that length takes `max_sfb_master` as its `max_sfb`; a shorter one takes the
  `n_sfb_side` value for its length.
- **Why:** a residual is combined with its partner track band by band, which needs the two to share
  their framing, and the partner's framing is the only one the syntax has sent at that point.
- **Evidence:** Text. The two transcriptions had first taken different readings (the first channel
  data `sf_info()`, and the one holding the largest transform length); neither matched Tables 181 and
  202.

#### b_use_sap_add_ch: the framing of its chparam_info()

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 33, p. 41: the two `chparam_info()` come before the `two_channel_data()` that
  carries the additional channels' own `sf_info()`, yet `chparam_info()` needs `num_window_groups` and
  `get_max_sfb()`.
- **Reading:** each follows the framing of the track Table 183 (p. 182) codes its additional channel
  against: F and G against D and E (Ls and Rs) for 3/4/0, and against A and B (L and R) for 5/2/0 and
  3/2/2. `add_ch_base` plays no part here; Table 183 does not use it.
- **Evidence:** Text. As above, the two transcriptions had first differed.

### The immersive element

Part 2's immersive_channel_element (6.2.4.1), which codes the 7.X.4 channel modes, and A-JCC's
ajcc_data() (6.2.6). The 9.X.4 modes pass the element b_5fronts 1 (6.2.3.1); see "The 9.X.4 element".
DEE codes 5.1.4 as 7.1.4 with the back pair absent, in ASPX_ACPL_2 from 192
to 448 kbps, ASPX_SCPL at 512 and SCPL at 768, always with core_5ch_grouping 0, 2ch_mode 0 and
b_use_sap_add_ch 0; the constructed streams of `tests/ac4/decoder/constructed.cpp` reach the rest.

#### immersive_codec_mode_code in the trace

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.5.1 and Table 73, p. 174: one bit, and after a 0 two more; Table 73 lists the
  codes 0b000 to 0b011 and 0b1.
- **Reading:** one record for the code, of 1 or 3 bits, valued at the bits read: 1 for ASPX_AJCC, 0 to
  3 for SCPL to ASPX_ACPL_2, as `aspx_int_class` records its code.
- **Evidence:** Streams, for the three modes DEE writes.

#### The framing of the immersive element's chparam_info()

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.4.1, pp. 128 and 129: two `chparam_info()` after `b_use_sap_add_ch`, before the
  `two_channel_data()` that carries F and G; and in SCPL, ASPX_SCPL and ASPX_ACPL_1 four more after the
  two `two_channel_data()` that carry H to K. `chparam_info()` needs `num_window_groups` and
  `get_max_sfb()` (Part 1 Table 47), and nothing names the `sf_info()` it takes them from.
- **Reading:** each follows the framing of the track the step it parameterises codes the other against,
  as the 7_X element's do ("b_use_sap_add_ch: the framing of its chparam_info()"): the first two are
  5.2.3.2 step 4's, which codes F and G against D and E, and take D's and E's; the four are Table 20's
  a'_0 to a'_3, which predict H, I, J and K from D', E', F' and G', and take D's, E's, F's and G's. Table
  19 places D and E among the core's tracks by `core_5ch_grouping` and `2ch_mode`, counted from the first
  track after the LFE's.
- **Why:** each step is a two-track matrix, `(D'', H'') = [[1, 0], [a', 1]] (D', H')` for Table 20's, whose
  first input is the track the other is coded against, as in Part 1's Table 183; reading it under the
  first input's framing gives the parameters for every band that input carries.
- **Evidence:** Text. DEE's ASPX_SCPL and SCPL streams parse alike, with identical digests, under this
  reading and under the other (the framing of H to K): their tracks share one framing in every frame.

### Object audio syntax

The syntax of object audio substreams, phase D10: `audio_data_ajoc()` with `var_channel_element()` and
A-JOC's `ajoc()` (Part 2 clauses 6.2.3.4, 6.2.4.4 and 6.2.5), `audio_data_objs()` (6.2.3.2), the object
audio metadata of clause 6.2.8, and `oamd_substream()` (6.2.2.4). Both transcriptions take every reading
here. The one encoded stream that reaches any of it is Chromium's `ac4-ajoc.ac4` (Dolby's, level 3: ten
downmix signals in a SIMPLE `var_channel_element()` and seventeen objects, no LFE, no decorrelators, one
metadata block a frame), which both read to the end of every substream of all 64 frames, every size
invariant holding; the constructed object streams of `tests/ac4/decoder/objects.cpp`, written with the
encoder's writers, and the differential check, whose synthetic streams include object-coded groups over
random payloads, reach the rest.

#### The objects of an A-JOC substream

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.3.4: `oamd_dyndata_single(n_dmx_signals, ..., obj_type_dmx[], is_lfe[])` and the
  same for the upmix, with `is_lfe[0] = 1` where `b_lfe` is set; §6.2.1.9 fills `obj_type[]` by two calls
  of `bed_dyn_obj_assignment()`, which list bed and intermediate spatial format objects alone and leave the
  LFE out (§6.3.2.8.2's NOTE); §6.3.2.8.1: "the static objects precede the dynamic objects"; Pseudocode 15
  puts the LFE after whichever of L, R and C the reconstruction contains, through flags nothing defines.
- **Reading:** each portion's objects are, in order, the LFE where `b_lfe` is set (so `is_lfe[0]` is the
  LFE, as the syntax sets it), the objects the portion's `bed_dyn_obj_assignment()` lists, and dynamic
  objects to make up the portion's fullband count. An assignment of more objects than that count, which
  §6.3.2.8.1 leaves undefined, is refused as invalid. A portion of more objects than an OAMD portion holds
  (64) is refused as unsupported, whatever count the stream sends: `n_fullband_upmix_signals` escapes
  through `variable_bits(3)`, which the syntax bounds no further, so the list of its objects is built no
  further than one past 64, and a count that does not fit an `int` is kept as `INT_MAX`. An object's
  metadata and its essence pair by that
  order: the LFE is the downmix's LFE, `Q'inAJOC[0]`, and the reconstruction's `QoutAJOC[o]` is the `o`th
  object after it; Pseudocode 15's position is an order of output, not a pairing.
- **Why:** the portions' metadata are read in the order the syntax lists the objects, and `is_lfe[0]` is
  the only placement of the LFE the syntax itself makes.
- **Evidence:** Text; Chromium's stream has no LFE and no static objects.

#### The objects of a direct-coded substream

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.1.11; §6.3.2.10.6 and its NOTE ("If the bed contains only one LFE channel, it will
  always be part of the first substream. If two LFE channels exist in the same bed, they are always split
  across two substreams, and the first substream contains LFE while the second substream contains LFE2"),
  and §6.3.2.10.7; `b_lfe` is read only with `b_dynamic_objects`, while `audio_data_objs()` takes one.
- **Reading:** a substream with dynamic objects codes the objects its element lists ("n_objects_code and
  the LFE"). A bed or an intermediate spatial format is listed by the substream that starts it
  (`b_bed_start`, `b_isf_start`) and continues through the substreams of the group after it that do not:
  its fullband objects go to those substreams in order, `n_objects` each, and its LFEs one to each of the
  first of them, LFE to the first and LFE2 to the second, which is the `b_lfe` their `audio_data_objs()`
  takes. A substream's objects are its LFE, then its fullband objects in the order its element's channels
  come out (L, R, C, Ls, Rs, as Tables 62 to 66 list beds). A substream that extends no started bed or
  intermediate spatial format, or takes more objects than one has left, is refused as invalid, and one of
  reserved data (`res_bytes`) that codes objects as unsupported.
- **Why:** a channel element carries at most five fullband objects, so any bed wider than 5.1 and every
  intermediate spatial format (4 to 30 objects, none of them 5 or fewer but SR3.1.0.0's four, which no
  element carries whole either) has to be split, and the text says only how the LFEs go.
- **Evidence:** Text; no stream here codes direct-coded objects but the constructed ones.

#### The objects oamd_dyndata_multi() lists

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.2.4 passes `oamd_dyndata_multi()` the `n_objs`, `obj_type[]`, `b_lfe[]` and
  `b_ajoc_coded[]` the table of contents set, which each `ac4_substream_info_obj()` and
  `bed_dyn_obj_assignment()` sets afresh; §6.3.9.5: "the order of all object essences present over all
  audio substreams of the according substream group in the order of bitstream presence".
- **Reading:** the objects of every substream of the group in order - an A-JOC substream's upmix objects,
  all A-JOC coded and so passed over, and each direct-coded substream's share - not the last substream's
  alone. An OAMD substream several groups name (§6.3.3.2.1) takes the first's. More than 64 objects are
  refused as unsupported, in a portion or a group, where the decoder has no storage for them: Table 55
  allows 17 and an LFE at md_compat 3.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Which oamd_timing_data() applies

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 7 places OAMD timing data in the OAMD substream or, for A-JOC, in
  `audio_data_ajoc()` (`b_dmx_timing`, `b_umx_timing`, `b_derive_timing_from_dmx`); §6.3.9.3.1: "One
  oamd_timing_data element applies to all substreams in a substream group"; the `num_obj_info_blocks` of
  each `oamd_dyndata_single()` and `oamd_dyndata_multi()` comes from one, and nothing says which where a
  frame sends none.
- **Reading:** a portion takes the timing it sends in the frame; else the A-JOC upmix portion with
  `b_derive_timing_from_dmx` the downmix portion's; else the last timing the group's OAMD substream sent,
  in this frame or an earlier one; else the last the portion sent of its own. With none of those the frame
  fails as missing its I-frame. The OAMD substream is read before the group's audio substreams, so that
  its timing serves them in the same frame; a frame keeps the timing a substream sent once the substream
  has been read.
- **Evidence:** Text. Chromium's stream sends both of A-JOC's timings in every frame.

#### var_channel_element()'s A-SPX and companding

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.4.4 reads `companding_control(n_dmx_signals)` for up to five signals and, in ASPX,
  `n_pairs` `aspx_data_2ch()` and, for an odd count, an `aspx_data_1ch()`, and says nothing of which
  tracks each covers; it calls both without the `b_iframe` the 22.2 element passes.
- **Reading:** the fullband tracks in syntax order, the LFE's `mono_data(1)` apart: `companding_control()`'s
  channels are the tracks in that order; `aspx_data_2ch()` k takes tracks 2k and 2k + 1, and the
  `aspx_data_1ch()` the last. The A-SPX elements read as Part 1's do, `b_iframe` being the substream's.
- **Evidence:** Text; Chromium's stream codes its downmix in SIMPLE.

#### Arrays read as one field

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.3.4 `dmx_active_signals_mask[]` (`n_fb_dmx_signals` bits), §6.2.3.5
  `de_main_dlg_flag[]` (`num_umx_signals` bits), §6.2.8.7 `group_zone_flag[]` (3), §6.2.8.9
  `trim_balance_presence[]` (5) and §6.2.8.11 `ext_prec_pos_presence[]` (3): each a flag array read in one
  syntax line, with no statement of which bit is which index.
- **Reading:** an array indexed by signal or object (`dmx_active_signals_mask[]`, `de_main_dlg_flag[]`) is
  sent in index order, [0] first, as the table of contents' channel assignment flags are read; one whose
  syntax tests its flags from the highest index down, each governing the field read next
  (`group_zone_flag[]`, `trim_balance_presence[]`, `ext_prec_pos_presence[]`), sends its highest index
  first, so that the flags come in the order of the fields they govern, as the inspector reads the table of
  contents' `trim()`. Each is one record of its width, valued at the bits in the order sent.
- **Evidence:** Text; Chromium's stream sends `de_main_dlg_flag[]` as seventeen zeros and none of the
  others.

#### add_per_object_md()'s parameters

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.8.5 calls `add_per_object_md(b_dynamic_object, b_object_not_active)`; §6.2.8.10
  defines `add_per_object_md(b_object_not_active, b_dynamic_object)` and reads `b_ext_prec_pos` "if
  (b_object_not_active == 0) { if (b_dynamic_object)".
- **Reading:** by name: `b_ext_prec_pos` is read for an active dynamic object, which is the object whose
  position extended precision refines. By position the flag would be read for a static object that is
  active, which has no position.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### A-JOC's dialogue enhancement data across frames

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.3.5 reads `de_max_gain` and `de_main_dlg_flag[]` with `b_dmx_de_cfg` and the
  coefficients for `num_dlg_obj` objects (Pseudocode 28, from the flags) where `b_keep_dmx_de_coeffs` is 0;
  §6.3.6.6.2: the flag "shall be ignored by the decoder if the current codec frame is an I-frame or
  b_dmx_de_cfg is true". Nothing says how long a configuration holds.
- **Reading:** a configuration holds until a frame sends another; an I-frame without one clears it, as Part
  1 §4.3.14.3.2 sets Gmax to 0 dB where an I-frame sends no `de_max_gain`, leaving no dialogue objects. The
  coefficients are read where the syntax says, `b_keep_dmx_de_coeffs` 0; "ignored" means that in an I-frame
  or with a new configuration nothing is kept from before, so a 1 there leaves no coefficients rather than
  reading ones the syntax does not send. A frame that is not an I-frame and needs coefficients read for a
  configuration no frame has sent fails as missing its I-frame.
- **Evidence:** Text. Chromium's stream sends the configuration in every frame with no dialogue objects and
  `b_keep_dmx_de_coeffs` 0.

#### ajoc_num_dpoints of 3

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.5.4 reads `ajoc_num_dpoints` in two bits; §5.7.3.4: "signals the number 0, 1 or 2
  of parameter sets".
- **Reading:** 3 fails the substream as invalid, when it is read.
- **Evidence:** Text; Chromium's stream sends 1 in every frame.

#### An object substream's channel_mode

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.2.2 passes `channel_mode` to `metadata()`, and its NOTE 2: "If channel_mode has not
  been set by a preceding info element, it shall be considered undefined and be represented by a negative
  numeric value"; the object substreams' info elements set none.
- **Reading:** negative for every A-JOC and direct-coded substream, whatever an earlier
  `ac4_substream_info_chan()` of the table of contents set: `basic_metadata()` then reads none of its
  channel-mode branches, `extended_metadata()`'s `pan_dialog` the branch for "not mono" (two pans and
  `pan_signal_selector`), and `dialog_enhancement()` no simulcast data.
- **Evidence:** Text. Chromium's stream sends no dialogue or downmix metadata in its substream.

#### Prefix codes in the trace

- **Where:** Part 2 §6.2.8.2 `oa_sample_offset_type` and `oa_sample_offset_code` ("1/2" bits), §6.2.8.6
  `basic_info_md` and `object_gain_code` (1/2), and §6.2.3.5 `de_dlg_dmx_coeff_idx` (VAR, Table 82).
- **Reading:** one record each, of the bits read, valued at them: 0b0, 0b10 or 0b11 for the first four, as
  `immersive_codec_mode_code` is recorded; 0b0, 0b1111 or one of 0b10000 to 0b11101 for
  `de_dlg_dmx_coeff_idx`.

### A-SPX

#### aspx_num_rel_right cites the wrong note

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 53, p. 55: in the VARVAR case `aspx_num_rel_right` cites "Note 2" (the
  float-division note); its width prints "2 (1)".
- **Reading:** Note 1: 1 bit when `num_aspx_timeslots` is 8 or fewer, else 2, as 4.3.10.4.7 (p. 101)
  says for every interval class.
- **Evidence:** Text (no stream here uses VARVAR).

#### aspx_ec_data() takes the derived frequency resolution

- **Where:** Part 1 Tables 51 and 52, pp. 53 and 54, pass `aspx_freq_res[ch]`, which `aspx_framing()`
  (Table 53) sends only when `aspx_freq_res_mode` is 0, and for FIXFIX only for the first envelope.
- **Reading:** each envelope's resolution is `atsg_freqres` from Pseudocodes 76 and 77 (pp. 210 and 211):
  FIXFIX copies the first envelope's to every envelope; mode 1 gives low and 3 high; mode 2 compares each
  envelope's length with `num_aspx_timeslots/6.0 + 3.25` (in integers, `12*length > 2*num_aspx_timeslots
  + 39`). Mode 2 outside I-frames needs `previous_stop_pos` from the previous frame, kept per channel and
  per A-SPX element position.
- **Evidence:** Streams for FIXFIX, FIXVAR and VARFIX (DEE uses mode 2 throughout); Text for VARVAR.

#### aspx_balance takes the first channel's framing

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 52, p. 54: with `aspx_balance` 1, `aspx_framing(1)` is not read, while
  `aspx_delta_dir(1)` and channel 1's `aspx_ec_data()` loop over its envelope counts.
- **Reading:** channel 1 takes channel 0's framing (interval class, envelope and noise counts, borders,
  `aspx_tsg_ptr`, resolutions and `aspx_qmode_env`), and its `previous_stop_pos` becomes channel 0's. It
  still reads its own `aspx_delta_dir(1)`, and its data with the balance codebooks. Clause 5.7.6.3.5 says
  the time envelopes "are identical for the channels".
- **Evidence:** Streams (balance is set in 5,943 census `aspx_data_2ch()` elements).

#### A stray brace in aspx_hfgen_iwc_2ch()

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 56, p. 57: the `for` in the `aspx_fic_right` branch opens a brace that nothing
  closes, which, counted literally, puts the time-interleaved section inside `aspx_fic_present`.
- **Reading:** the brace is stray; `aspx_tic_present` is read whether or not `aspx_fic_present` is set,
  as the page's indentation and Table 55 show. The same table lacks a semicolon after
  `aspx_tna_mode[1][n] = aspx_tna_mode[0][n]`.
- **Evidence:** Streams.

#### Counts computed exactly

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 70, p. 206 (`num_sbg_noise`), and Table 53's Note 2 (`ptr_bits`).
- **Reading:** both in integers: `num_sbg_noise` as the largest k with
  `2^(2k-1) * sbx^(2*aspx_noise_sbg) <= sbz^(2*aspx_noise_sbg)` (at least 1), and `ptr_bits` as the bit
  width of `aspx_num_env + 1`. A floating-point evaluation agrees on all 1,808 reachable
  `num_sbg_noise` settings, the closest to a rounding boundary being 0.003 away.

#### Values the A-SPX syntax cannot follow

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 68, p. 204; 4.3.10.1.9, p. 98; Table 128, p. 101.
- **Reading:** failures: an `aspx_xover_subband_offset` at or beyond `num_sbg_master` (the master table
  would be indexed past its end, or leave no subband group), more than five noise subband groups
  (5.7.6.3.1.3), and more envelopes than Table 128 allows (four for FIXFIX, five otherwise).

#### aspx_tsg_ptr for FIXFIX

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 53 sends no `aspx_tsg_ptr` for FIXFIX, while Pseudocodes 92 and 95 (5.7.6.4.2)
  compare envelopes with it for every interval class.
- **Reading:** -1, the value a transmitted 0 gives, which points at no envelope: no transient. Pseudocodes
  92, 95 and 99 then treat no envelope as a transient's, and add sinusoids from the first.

#### Stray semicolon in the limiter's patch borders

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 72, p. 207: `for (sbg = 1; sbg < num_sbg_patches; sbg++);` before its
  block.
- **Reading:** the block is the loop's body, copying the interior patch borders, which matches
  `num_sbg_lim = num_sbg_sig_lowres + num_sbg_patches - 1`. Not syntax: the limiter
  (`src/ac4/src/core/aspx/frequency_tables.cpp`) takes it.

#### freq_res_prev in Pseudocode 80

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 80, p. 214: `atsg_freqres[num_atsg_sig_prev - 1]`, with two unbalanced
  parentheses.
- **Reading:** the previous interval's resolution vector, which the paragraph after the pseudocode names
  `freq_res_prev`: its last envelope's resolution, which maps the first envelope's time deltas between
  resolutions. Not syntax: the envelope decoding (`src/ac4/src/decoder/pcm/aspx.cpp`) takes it.

### A-CPL

The first two entries are syntax, which both transcriptions read alike. The rest are the decoding of
clause 5.7.7 (phase D5), the decoder's readings: the Python reference transcribes the syntax only. The
builder of the constructed A-CPL streams (`tests/ac4/decoder/constructed.cpp`) works each channel's
tone back through Pseudocodes 115 to 120 and takes the same readings, as the encoder's A-CPL (phase E4)
must. The evidence for the decoding's readings is DEE's 5.1 streams in ASPX_ACPL_2 (128 and 144 kbps)
and ASPX_ACPL_3 (96 kbps), scored per parameter band against their sources
(`tools/checks/score_ac4_decode.py`), the text, or both. librempeg cannot settle any of them: it
decodes those streams' coded pair as L and R and leaves Ls and Rs silent.

#### Partial coupling starts at acpl_param_band

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 121, p. 244, against `acpl_huff_data()` (Table 65, p. 61): the table sends
  bands from `start_band`; the pseudocode's frequency and time differencing run from band 0.
- **Reading:** the syntax as Table 65 writes it; the pseudocode's differencing starts at `start_band`
  when `acpl_param_band` is not 0 (PARTIAL mode). The bands below it carry no values: 0 after
  dequantisation, and 0 in the quantised history that DIFF_TIME adds to. Only subbands below
  `acpl_qmf_band` lie in them, which Pseudocode 116 mid-side decodes without any parameter.
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed ASPX_ACPL_1 streams, whose `acpl_param_band` is 4 to 8.

#### Codebook offsets

- **Where:** Part 1 Tables 58 and 65.
- **Reading:** the trace records codebook indices before `cb_off`. Dequantisation subtracts `cb_off` for
  A-CPL's F0 codebooks and every DF and DT codebook, and not for A-SPX's F0 codebooks, whose tables print
  none.

#### Values outside the dequantisation tables

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 121 and Tables 203 to 208, pp. 244 to 246: nothing bounds what differential
  decoding adds up to.
- **Reading:** a quantised value outside its table (alpha 0 to 32, beta 0 to 8, beta3 0 to 16 and gamma
  -20 to 20 at fine quantisation, half those at coarse, the ranges of the F0 codebooks) fails the frame
  as an invalid stream, as the A-SPX values the syntax cannot follow do. The frame is refused when it is
  read, before its parameters wait d_ctrl frames, and the history DIFF_TIME adds to moves on only with a
  frame that is kept.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### When A-CPL's parameters apply

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.2 (d_ctrl) and 5.7.7.1, pp. 193 and 232: A-CPL takes A-SPX's output, and its
  interpolation runs over the frame's time slots; nothing places its parameters in time otherwise.
- **Reading:** a frame's A-CPL data wait d_ctrl frames with its A-SPX data, and interpolate over the time
  slots of the matrix A-SPX puts out for that frame, `ts_offset_hfgen` slots behind the QMF analysis.
- **Evidence:** Observation. On DEE's 5.1 music at 128 kbps the mean distance of the output's level
  difference from the source's, over the 15 bands and both pairs, is 2.60 dB; applying each frame's
  parameters a frame earlier gives 3.84 dB and a frame later 3.60 dB, and the film and 96 kbps legs move
  alike.

#### The transient ducker's energy

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.7.4.3, pp. 236 to 238: Pseudocode 112 names p_energy "the energy per parameter
  band of the input channel", Pseudocode 113 sums `|x[sb]|^2`, and Pseudocode 114's
  `applyTransientDucker(x)` scales the decorrelator's output. Which channel is the input is not said: the
  decorrelator's input, or the ducker's.
- **Reading:** the ducker's own input, the decorrelator's output that its gains scale, the one signal
  `applyTransientDucker()` is given.
- **Evidence:** Observation, and weak. On DEE's 5.1 music at 128 kbps the per-band distances from the
  source are 2.604 dB and 0.246 in correlation with this reading, and 2.622 dB and 0.249 with the
  decorrelator's input; the film and 96 kbps legs order alike, by as little. Without the ducker at all
  the distances are 2.605 dB and 0.245: on these measures it barely acts.

#### The transient ducker's time step

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 112, p. 236, keeps its arrays "of the previous frame"; Pseudocode 113, p.
  237, computes p_energy from one subsample per subband.
- **Reading:** the ducker's frame is a QMF time slot: the peak decay, the smoothed energies and the gains
  move on slot by slot, and each slot's gains scale that slot. ALPHA then decays the peak with a time
  constant of about four slots, 5 ms.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### The transient ducker's bands

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 112 to 114, pp. 236 to 238: `acpl_max_num_param_bands = 15`, and
  `sb_to_pb()` by Table 197 without a column.
- **Reading:** the 15-band column, whatever `acpl_num_param_bands` the data element sends.
- **Evidence:** Text; DEE sends 15 bands in every frame, so its streams do not decide.

#### Products and sums interpolate from their own acpl_param_prev

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 118 and 119, pp. 241 and 242, interpolate products and sums of
  parameters (`g1*a`, `b3*a`, `g1_dq + g3_dq + g5_dq`), and Pseudocode 110, p. 234, keeps acpl_param_prev
  "for all relevant dequantized advanced coupling parameter arrays".
- **Reading:** each product or sum is an array of its own, whose acpl_param_prev is its value in the last
  parameter set of the previous frame. That value is the same product or sum of the parameters' own
  acpl_param_prev, subband by subband, so only the eleven parameters' are kept. The first frame's are 0.
- **Evidence:** Text; DEE's ASPX_ACPL_3 legs meet the pins of the per-band script.

#### Each module interpolates with its own acpl_data_1ch()

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 117 and 120, pp. 239 to 242, pass each module the `acpl_num_param_sets`
  of its own `acpl_data_1ch()`; Pseudocode 109's `interpolate()` reads `acpl_interpolation_type` and
  `acpl_param_timeslot` without saying whose.
- **Reading:** those of the module's own `acpl_data_1ch()`, which sends them in its
  `acpl_framing_data()`.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Channels A-CPL makes are silent before it

- **Where:** Part 1 5.3.4.1 (the channel pair's ASPX_ACPL_2, R = 0), 5.3.4.3.2 (the 5.X element's
  ASPX_ACPL_2, Ls = Rs = 0), 5.3.4.3.3 (ASPX_ACPL_3, C = Ls = Rs = 0) and Table 185 (the 7.X element's
  ASPX_ACPL_2, its last pair 0), pp. 179 to 183. Such a channel has no `sf_info()` to give its windows.
- **Reading:** it passes the inverse transform as one long block of silence, and the QMF analysis as
  silence, until A-CPL writes it; no output depends on it.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### add_ch_base in 3/4/0

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 120, p. 242, scales z0 and z2 by sqrt 2 when `add_ch_base == 1 ||
  channel_mode == 3/4/0.x`, and z6 and z7 when `add_ch_base == 0`. The 3/4/0 modes send no `add_ch_base`
  (Part 1 Table 9 and Part 2 6.2.1.8 read it for 5/2/0 and 3/2/2 alone; Table 202, p. 242, marks it N/A).
- **Reading:** 3/4/0 takes the `add_ch_base` 1 branch in both tests, so its L and R (z6 and z7) pass
  unscaled.
- **Why:** Table 202 couples 3/4/0's surrounds with its back pair as `add_ch_base` 1 couples the 5/2/0 and
  3/2/2 surrounds with their last pair, and the pseudocode's first test groups the two already. Read so,
  the 7.X element's modes pass L, R and C at unity and scale the rest, as Pseudocode 117 does in the 5.X
  element, and as Table 219's 7-to-5 downmix passes 3/4/0's L and R.
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed 3/4/0 streams take it.

#### ASPX_ACPL_1 in the 7.X element

- **Where:** Part 1 5.3.4.4.2, p. 182: "analogously to" SIMPLE with `b_use_sap_add_ch` false, "with the
  difference that the output channels F and G are derived from two sf_data elements and their
  associated chparam_info elements".
- **Reading:** each residual is coded against the channel Table 202 couples it with, by the 5.X
  element's step (5.3.4.3.2): (base, F) = P (base, residual), with P from the residual's
  `chparam_info()` read under the residual's own `sf_info()`, in the bands that sends parameters for, and
  the identity above them. The bases are Ls and Rs in 3/4/0 and with `add_ch_base` 1, else L and R.
- **Why:** A-CPL's modules pair F and G with those channels (Pseudocode 120), and the syntax already
  frames the residuals after them ("ASPX_ACPL_1: the framing of the residuals").
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed 7.X ASPX_ACPL_1 streams take it.

#### A change of codec mode

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.7.3, p. 234, starts acpl_param_prev at 0 "when decoding the first AC-4 frame",
  and the NOTE after Pseudocode 112 starts the ducker at 0 "at startup"; nothing says what a change of
  codec mode, at an I-frame, keeps.
- **Reading:** a frame in another codec mode than the frame before starts A-CPL as the first frame does:
  silence in the decorrelators, the duckers at 0, acpl_param_prev and the quantised history 0.
- **Evidence:** Text.

### Metadata, DRC and dialogue enhancement

#### drc_gainset_size does and does not count drc_version

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.13.5.1, p. 130 ("the size in bits of the following drc_gains element"), against
  Table 74, p. 67 (`bits_left = drc_gainset_size - 2 - used_bits`).
- **Reading:** for `drc_version` 1 or more, the formula decides how many `drc2_bits` are read. For
  version 0 nothing is read by the size; both `used_bits + 2` and `used_bits` are accepted, and anything
  else fails as a misread.
- **Evidence:** Text (DEE sends DRC curves, never gains).

#### b_associated and b_dialog are parameters at sus_ver 0

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.7.4's note, p. 139; Part 1 4.3.12.4.1 and 4.3.12.4.2, p. 118; Table 158a,
  p. 119.
- **Reading:** at sus_ver 0 neither is read. `b_associated` is set for a substream whose
  `content_classifier` is 0b010, 0b011 or 0b101, or which is the associated audio substream of a
  presentation_config 2, 3 or 4 presentation; read literally, every substream of such a presentation,
  the main one included, would be "associated". `b_dialog` is set for the dialogue substream of
  presentation_config 0 or 3, or for `content_classifier` 0b100. At sus_ver 1, which bitstream_version 2
  implies, `b_dialog` is a field.
- **Evidence:** Streams for sus_ver 1; Text for sus_ver 0.

#### drc_gains() is a brace short

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 75, p. 67: the band loop has no opening brace, yet a closing one follows the
  reference reset.
- **Reading:** the indentation's: the band loop holds the subframe loop and the reset. The number of
  `drc_gain_code` reads, channels × bands × subframes − 1, is the same under any placement.

#### drc_repeat_id copies a whole mode

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 72, p. 65; 4.3.13.3.5, p. 124.
- **Reading:** a repeated mode takes the default profile flag, the compression curve flag,
  `drc_gains_config` and the curve of the mode it names, and keeps its own output levels. A repeat of a
  mode the same `drc_config()` has not yet configured is a failure. The syntax copies only the curve
  flag, but without `drc_gains_config` a repeated gains mode has no band count to read by.
- **Evidence:** Streams (a census stream with DEE's DRC options repeats earlier modes).

#### nr_drc_channels for modes Table 168 leaves out

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 168, p. 131, lists mono, stereo, 5.1 and the 7.1 modes; Part 2 Table 69,
  p. 170, the immersive modes and 22.2.
- **Reading:** a mode without LFE takes its twin's count (3 for 5.0 and the 7.0 modes), since Table 69
  puts the LFE in a group "in case they are present". 3.0 has no twin, and a presentation with no
  channel mode has no count: channel-dependent gains there are refused as unsupported.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### oamd_dyndata_single() in metadata() of a channel-coded substream

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.7.1, p. 135, reads it when `b_alternative` is set and `b_ajoc` is 0, which holds
  for a channel-coded substream of an alternative presentation; its `n_objs` and object types exist only
  for object substreams.
- **Reading:** a channel-coded substream never carries it. Table 7 places OAMD dynamic data only in
  object audio substreams that are not A-JOC coded: a direct-coded object substream of an alternative
  presentation reads it, over its own objects ("The objects of a direct-coded substream", under "Object
  audio syntax"), with the `num_obj_info_blocks` of its group's timing ("Which oamd_timing_data()
  applies").

#### de_data() predicts from the wrong channel

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.7.6, p. 140: `ref_val = de_par[0][band]` for channels after the first; Part 1
  Table 78, p. 69, writes `de_par[ch][band]`.
- **Reading:** Part 1's. The codewords read do not depend on it, only the parameter values, so the trace
  is unaffected. A DEE stream with `de_channel_config` 6 and `de_ms_proc_flag` 0 takes this path in every
  I-frame (`ac4-20-speech-128` is one), and `tests/ac4/decoder/test_de.cpp` decodes it through dialogue
  enhancement at 0 dB and at its cap.

#### de_ms_proc_flag leaves one parameter set

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 78, p. 69: with `de_ms_proc_flag` set, `de_data()` reads parameters for
  `ch < de_nr_channels - de_ms_proc_flag`; 5.7.8.7, p. 253: "only one parameter subset is transmitted
  for application to the Mid signal".
- **Reading:** as printed, the syntax and the semantics agreeing: one parameter set, the Mid's.
- **Evidence:** Text. No DEE stream sets the flag. MediaInfo (MediaInfoLib 26.05, as DEE 6.5.4 ships it)
  reads two sets after it: on a stream with the Mid, the encoder's (`dialogue-method=mid`) and the test
  multiplexer's alike, it reports "NOK: tools_metadata", and it reports nothing when a second set
  follows the flag, which the text does not send.

#### Dialogue enhancement and DRC configuration across I-frames

- **Where:** Part 2 4.5.2, pp. 35 and 36; Part 1 Tables 70 and 76; 4.3.14.5.3, p. 133.
- **Reading:** an I-frame replaces the stored `drc_config()` and `de_config()` when it carries them and
  clears them when `b_drc_present` or `b_de_data_present` is 0; a later frame that needs a configuration
  none holds fails as missing its I-frame. The simulcast `de_data()` keeps its own time-differential
  state. `de_par_prev` is zeroed for channels a frame does not code.

#### The end of an EMDF payload list

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.15.1.1, p. 134, against Table 18, p. 34.
- **Reading:** the syntax's: `while (emdf_payload_id != 0)` reads the 5-bit id as its test, and an id of
  0 ends the list with nothing after it but `byte_align`; the semantics' fields "set to 0" are not read.

#### further_loudness_info() at sus_ver 0

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.7.3, p. 138, against Part 1 Table 68, p. 63.
- **Reading:** Part 2's, which reads `b_rtllcomp` and `rtll_comp` inside the extension; an `e_bits_size`
  too small to hold them is a failure.
- **Evidence:** Text (bitstream_version 2 implies sus_ver 1).

#### basic_metadata() across the page break

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.7.2, pp. 135 and 136.
- **Reading:** the rendered page 136 closes the `sus_ver == 0` block after `preferred_dmx_method`, so the
  5.X and 7.X blocks, `phase90_info_mc`, `b_surround_attenuation_known` and `b_lfe_attenuation_known`
  are read at both substream versions, although the extracted text's indentation suggests otherwise.
  "channel_mode == 5_X" is ch_mode 3 or 4, "7_X" 5 to 10, "3/4/0" 5 or 6, and "3/2/2" 9 or 10.
- **Evidence:** Streams for stereo and 5.1.

#### The presentation substream

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.2.3 to 6.2.2.5 and 6.3.3.1, pp. 124 to 172; 6.2.9, p. 152.
- **Readings:**
  - `superset(0, 1)` is 1, as 6.3.3.1.27 says, although its own rule would give 3.0. Six unordered pairs
    have no mode holding both: 5/2/0 and 5/2/0.1 each with 9.0.4 and 9.1.4, and 9.0.4 and 9.1.4 each with
    22.2 - the first of each pair brings Lw/Rw, the second Lscr/Rscr, and 22.2 has Lw/Rw without Lscr/Rscr.
    6.3.3.1.27 gives no result for them, and the reading taken is that there is none: `pres_ch_mode` is
    -1, so the presentation substream reads the fields that answer to a presentation with no single
    channel mode (`b_oamd_common_timing`, `custom_dmx_data()`'s `bs_ch_config` branch, `b_obj_loud_corr`).
    Naming the larger of the two instead would claim a layout the presentation does not have, and would
    drop the LFE of 5/2/0.1 against 9.0.4.
  - Table 72's conditions overlap; 2 wins when both hold.
  - `n_substreams_in_presentation` counts one per `ac4_substream_info_chan/_ajoc/_obj()`, whatever the
    frame rate factor; HSF extension substreams are not counted.
  - The advanced dialogue enhancement defaults are never given: an I-frame without the configuration, or
    without `advanced_de_data()`, clears it.
  - `advanced_de_compr_thresh`, "an integer" from -32 to 31, is 6-bit two's complement, the one signed
    coding Part 2 states (6.3.9.8.3); the trace records the raw code.
  - The syntax reads `b_tdc_extension` and `reserved_bits` where the semantics describe
    `tdc_extension`; the records use the syntax's names.
  - `if (3 <= bs_ch_config <= 4)` is the range 3 to 4; read as C it holds for every value.
  - `channel_mode_contains_TflTfr()` (Pseudocode 36, p. 183) is true for ch_mode 9 and 10 only, so the
    immersive modes carry no `b_tfl_active`; implemented as written.

#### Misprints with no effect

- Part 1 Table 80, p. 70, is titled `emdf_reserved()` over a syntax headed `emdf_protection()`; one
  element.
- Part 2 Table 48, p. 111, cites Part 1 clauses 4.2.4.2 and 4.2.4.3 for `ac4_hsf_ext_substream` and
  `emdf_payloads_substream`, which V1.4.1 numbers 4.2.4.3 and 4.2.4.4.
- Part 1 Table B.2, p. 283, lists a 96 kHz transform length of 920 where the other tables have 960.
- Part 1 Pseudocode 21, p. 142, lacks the brace that closes `if (first_scf_found == 1)` before its
  `else`.
- Part 1 Table 213, p. 267, names the last pair of 7.X 3/2/2 (Lth, Rth); Table 88, p. 77, and Table 183,
  p. 182, name it Tfl and Tfr, as the decoder does.
- Part 1 5.1.4.2, p. 143, has the noise fill replace silent bands "if noise fill data is present as
  indicated when b_snf_data_exists is false", and the next sentence makes the tool inactive when it is
  false. It runs when `b_snf_data_exists` is true, the only case in which `asf_snf_data()` (Table 42,
  p. 48) reads any noise fill data.

### Reconstruction

The readings the decoding of clause 5 takes. Phase D2 of `planning/ac4.md` decodes the audio spectral
frontend, stereo processing, the inverse transform and frame alignment for mono and stereo in the SIMPLE
codec mode; later phases add theirs. The Python reference transcribes the syntax only, so these are the
decoder's readings alone, and the evidence for each is DEE's streams scored against their sources and
against librempeg (`docs/verification.md`, "The decoder's output"), the text, or a test against the
clause's formula.

#### Full scale, and the overlap-add's factor of two

- **Where:** Part 1 5.5.2.2, p. 186: Pseudocode 62 divides by N, and Pseudocode 64 adds the windowed
  blocks as they are. The informative example after Table 187, p. 190, adds each block's windowed
  samples to the overlap buffer "using a factor of 2". Neither part says what sample value is full scale.
- **Reading:** Pseudocodes 60 to 64 as printed, with no factor of two, and full scale at 2^15: the
  decoder divides its output by 32 768. The two are one constant in the output, so the measurement
  below fixes their product, and this pair is the one that needs no factor the pseudocode does not
  print.
- **Evidence:** Streams. DEE's 2.0 tone leg (`ac4-20-tones-192`, a -20 dBFS sine on each channel,
  loudness measured only) decodes at 0.005 dB below its source, and the 2.0 music leg at 0.02 dB below;
  with the example's factor both would be 6.02 dB above. librempeg decodes both at the same level,
  within 0.001 dB of this decoder. Through the literal transform and a forward MDCT without scaling, a
  windowed round trip has a gain of 1/2 (`tests/ac4/core/test_dsp.cpp`), which is what a factor of
  two in the example would restore.

#### KBD_RIGHT's argument

- **Where:** Part 1 5.5.2.2 step 6, p. 188, windows the previous block's second half with
  KBD_RIGHT(NW, n - Nskip) for Nskip <= n < NW + Nskip, an argument from 0 to NW - 1. 5.5.3, p. 189,
  defines KBD_RIGHT(N, n) for N <= n < 2N only.
- **Reading:** KBD_RIGHT(NW, NW + n - Nskip): the right half of the window at the same position, which is
  the left half reversed.
- **Evidence:** Streams, and the text's own condition. DEE switches block lengths in 31 of the 120 frames
  of the 2.0 music leg, which decodes at the SNR librempeg reaches. With this reading the windows meet
  the Princen-Bradley condition and blocks reconstruct their input to 1e-12 across every transition
  Table 187 allows (`tests/ac4/core/test_dsp.cpp`); the argument as printed lies outside the
  function's domain.

#### The KBD kernel is summed to p = N

- **Where:** Part 1 5.5.3, p. 189, defines the kernel W(N, n, alpha) "for 0 <= n < N", and the sums in
  both KBD_LEFT and KBD_RIGHT run to p = N.
- **Reading:** the kernel's formula at n = N as well, which makes it a Kaiser window of N + 1 points,
  symmetric about N/2, with W(N, N) = W(N, 0).
- **Evidence:** Text. With the term at p = N the halves meet the Princen-Bradley condition exactly; the
  windows equal numpy's Kaiser window of N + 1 points, cumulated, to 1e-12
  (`tests/ac4/core/test_dsp.cpp`).

#### The overlap buffer before the first block

- **Where:** Part 1 5.5.2.1, p. 185, describes `overlap` and `Nprev` as state carried from the previous
  block, and says nothing of their value before the first one.
- **Reading:** silence, and a previous block of full length, so that the first block takes its
  unmodified left window. A change of source keeps the overlap ("A change of source"); a frame that
  returns nothing while it waits for an I-frame drops it, and the frame decoded after the wait starts
  from this state.
- **Evidence:** Text; the first frame's output differs from a mid-stream decode only in the half block
  the missing predecessor would have filled.

#### Pseudocode 59's stray block

- **Where:** Part 1 5.3.2, p. 174. After the branches for `sap_mode` 0, 1 and 2, Pseudocode 59 prints an
  `if (sap_used[g][sfb]) { ... } else { ... }` pair that sets a, b, c and d again, followed by an
  `else { // sap_mode == 3` with no `if` of its own. Taken as printed, the pair would reset every M/S
  band to the identity, since `sap_used` is only set in the `sap_mode` 3 branch.
- **Reading:** the pair is a stray copy of the end of the `sap_mode` 3 branch and belongs to no branch.
  `sap_mode` 0, and 1 where `ms_used` is 0, give the identity; 2, and 1 where `ms_used` is 1, give M/S
  (a = b = c = 1, d = -1); 3 gives the prediction of its own branch. `0.1f` is taken as written, a
  float. An `alpha_q` a later delta refers to, in a band `sap_data()` sent no coefficient for, is 0.
- **Evidence:** Streams. DEE's 2.0 streams use all three modes (the tone leg `sap_mode` 3 in 119 of 120
  frames, the music leg mostly 2), and decode at 50 dB (tones) and 35 dB (music) SNR against their
  source, the SNR librempeg reaches, with the two decoders' outputs 78 to 93 dB apart.

#### Scale factors outside 0 to 255

- **Where:** Part 1 5.1.3.2, p. 142: "Only scale factor values sfn in the range 0 to 255 are valid".
- **Reading:** a scale factor that the deltas take outside that range fails the substream as
  `kInvalidStream`.
- **Evidence:** Text; no stream here does it.

#### x = x++ in Pseudocode 57

- **Where:** Part 1 5.2.8.3, pp. 171 and 172: Pseudocodes 56 and 57 update the generator's state with
  `psS->uiStateIdx = psS->uiStateIdx++;` and, on a wrap, `psS->uiCurrentIdx = psS->uiCurrentIdx++;`,
  which C leaves undefined and C++17 makes a no-op.
- **Reading:** an increment.
- **Evidence:** Text. Pseudocode 24 gives the state after 255 x (sequence_counter mod 256) steps in closed
  form; stepping the generator from Pseudocode 55's state reaches that closed form at all 65,286 offsets
  with the increment and at 2 with the no-op. `tests/ac4/decoder/test_pcm.cpp` steps it for every
  counter. No stream here sets `b_snf_data_exists`, so no stream exercises the generator: not DEE's, the
  census's or the third-party ones.

#### When the noise fill's generator starts

- **Where:** Part 1 5.1.4.2, p. 145: the generator "is initialized at the beginning of the decoding of an
  Audio Spectral Front end (ASF) frame, using the sequence_counter value".
- **Reading:** once for each audio substream in each frame, before its first `sf_data()`, and drawn from
  in the order the substream's `sf_data()` elements occur. Started again for every track, it would give
  every track of a frame the same sequence, since `sequence_counter` is the frame's, and the noise of the
  two channels of a pair would be the same noise at two levels.
- **Evidence:** Text; no stream here sets `b_snf_data_exists`.

#### The LFE's track is not numbered in Tables 180 and 182

- **Where:** Part 1 5.3.4.3.0 and 5.3.4.4.0, pp. 180 and 181: Tables 180 and 182 number the tracks "according
  to the bitstream order of the channel data elements", five or seven of them, and name no LFE, though the
  5_X and 7_X elements read the LFE's `mono_data(1)` before any channel data (Tables 25 and 33).
- **Reading:** the tables count from the first track after the LFE's. The LFE's `mono_data(1)` gives the
  LFE channel by 5.3.3.1 (O0 = I0), and the LFE goes through the QMF banks with the other channels,
  untouched there: 6.2.10 leaves it out of A-SPX and Table 212 out of companding.
- **Evidence:** Streams. DEE's 5.1 streams from 192 to 768 kbps decode with each channel's tone on its own
  channel, the LFE's included, and agree with librempeg's decode to 83 dB channel by channel.

#### The 7.X element's additional channels

- **Where:** Part 1 5.3.4.4.1, p. 181, and Table 183, p. 182: with `b_use_sap_add_ch`, a 2 x 2 matrix
  makes two channels of an output of one channel data element (D or E, or A or B) and one of the
  additional `two_channel_data()` (F or G), "after the creation of the preliminary outputs". The two come
  from different elements, each with its own `sf_info()`, and nothing makes their time/frequency tiles
  the same.
- **Reading:** the matrix applies tile by tile under the framing its `chparam_info()` was read with, the
  first input's ("b_use_sap_add_ch: the framing of its chparam_info()" above), to the two inputs' lines in
  window order after ungrouping: in each window, the bands below that framing's `max_sfb` for the window's
  group, at the window's own band offsets. The inputs must be transformed alike, window for window, and a
  frame whose inputs are not is refused as invalid. Bands above `max_sfb` are left as they are.
- **Why:** a tile of one input has no counterpart in the other unless their windows match, and window
  order is where the two elements' lines meet: in bitstream order each keeps its own grouping and
  `max_sfb`.
- **Evidence:** Text, and the constructed 7.X streams of `tests/ac4/decoder/constructed.cpp`, whose
  tracks are the channels through the inverse of Table 183's matrix and which decode with each tone on its
  channel. The encoder writes the element as an experimental option, with `b_use_sap_add_ch` 0, so its
  streams do not reach the matrix.

### The QMF domain

The readings phase D3 of `planning/ac4.md` takes for the QMF banks, companding and A-SPX decoding (Part 1
clause 5.7). They are the decoder's alone, as under "Reconstruction". The evidence is DEE's 2.0 legs at 48
to 144 kbps and its native-rate immersive stereo (IMS) legs in G0's gold set, scored against their sources
(`tools/checks/score_ac4_decode.py`), the text, or a test in `tests/ac4/core/test_aspx.cpp` and
`tests/ac4/decoder/test_aspx.cpp`. Across those 24 legs DEE sets the limiter, interpolation and
pre-flattening in every `aspx_config()`, uses FIXFIX, FIXVAR and VARFIX intervals, and never sets
`aspx_balance`, either interleaved waveform coding, `sync_flag` or VARVAR; the tests carry those.

#### Every codec mode passes through the QMF banks

- **Where:** Part 1 6.2.8, p. 266, says the QMF analysis "is needed for the tools which operate in the QMF
  domain", and 5.7.1, p. 193, that the synthesis works on QMF data delayed by six QMF slots. Figure 9,
  p. 259, draws one chain for every substream.
- **Reading:** SIMPLE substreams pass through the analysis and synthesis banks too, behind the same
  history of `ts_offset_hfgen` slots that A-SPX keeps (Table 192), so the decoder has one delay for every
  codec mode: `d_pcm`, the banks' 577 samples and 6 x 64 samples, 1,313 at `frame_rate_index` 13. The
  banks reconstruct to 75 to 88 dB on tones and 78 dB on noise, which bounds a SIMPLE decode's SNR.
- **Evidence:** Observation. DEE's SIMPLE and ASPX 2.0 streams decode with the same lag, 4,385 samples,
  and its output manifests give both the same MP4 offset; librempeg's output lags DEE's source by one
  delay, 3,649 samples, on SIMPLE and ASPX streams alike. DEE's IMS encoder runs one frame shorter: its
  streams lag by 2,337.

#### Companding measures against full scale 1.0

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.5.2, p. 198: the gain `L(ts)^((1 - alpha)/alpha)` depends on the scale of the
  slot level `L`, which the text does not state; A-SPX's signal scale factors (5.7.6.3.5) are absolute
  energies in the same QMF matrices.
- **Reading:** the QMF domain runs at the scale the inverse transform produces, full scale 2^15 ("Full
  scale, and the overlap-add's factor of two"), and companding divides its levels by 2^15 before the
  exponent.
- **Evidence:** Observation. DEE's 48 kbps 2.0 legs set `b_compand_on` in 470 of their 474 channel frames.
  Measured at 2^15 they decode 48.5 dB loud, which is (2^15)^(0.35/0.65), 48.6 dB; against full scale 1.0
  they decode within 0.17 dB of the source. A-SPX's envelopes read only at 2^15: its smallest signal scale
  factor, 64, is the energy of one least significant bit of white noise there, and of noise at 0 dBFS at
  full scale 1.0.

#### The companding average

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.5.2, p. 198. The average gain's exponent prints as "1alpha / alpha". `L_avg`'s sum
  runs from `ts0` to `ts1`, where the tool's range is `[ts0, ts1 - 1]`. With `sync_flag`, `g_synch(ts)`
  averages the channels' gains per slot, but the two channels of an `aspx_data_2ch()` without
  `aspx_balance` frame their intervals separately.
- **Reading:** the exponent `(1 - alpha)/alpha`, as for the per-slot gain; the average over `[ts0, ts1)`,
  divided by `ts1 - ts0`; with `sync_flag`, each slot averages the gains of the channels whose interval
  holds it, and each channel is scaled over its own interval.
- **Evidence:** Text for the exponent and the sum. The gold legs set `b_compand_avg` in 721 channel frames
  and never `sync_flag`.

#### Companding's slots are Q_low's

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.5.1, p. 197: the matrices hold "exactly those QMF time slots that are part of the
  A-SPX interval". The interval's borders count from slot 0 of Q_low, the analysis delayed by
  `ts_offset_hfgen` (5.7.6.3.2, 5.7.6.3.3.1), while companding runs before A-SPX (Figure 6).
- **Reading:** companding scales the delayed matrix over the interval's slots on Q_low's axis. A slot that
  an interval running past its frame's end holds is companded once, with that interval, and waits for the
  next frame companded.
- **Evidence:** Text: only on that axis does every slot an interval can hold, up to `num_qmf_timeslots +
  ts_offset_hfgen`, exist when the interval is decoded. Observation, slightly: DEE's companded speech legs
  at 48 and 64 kbps score 0.14 and 0.18 dB more SNR below the crossover this way than companded six slots
  earlier, on the analysis's own axis.

#### The estimated envelope's time divisor

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 90, p. 220, sums `|Q_high|^2` over the QMF slots from `tsa` to `tsz` and
  divides by `atsg_sig[atsg+1] - atsg_sig[atsg]`, the envelope's length in A-SPX slots, each
  `num_ts_in_ats` QMF slots long.
- **Reading:** the length in QMF slots, which makes `est_sig_sb` the mean energy per QMF subsample that
  clause 3.1 makes a signal scale factor: "average energy of the signal within the region in a QMF matrix".
- **Evidence:** Observation. Where the source has content above the crossover (DEE's music at 48 kbps and
  speech at 48, 64 and 128 kbps), the divisor as printed decoded the A-SPX tiles 3.5 to 4.8 dB below the
  source's on average when phase D3 measured them, and this one 1.3 to 2.2 dB below, of which the limiter
  accounted for up to 1 dB. With the pre-flattening phase D4 reads ("Pre-flattening's direction", below),
  this one decodes them 0.5 to 1.0 dB below.

#### alpha0's parentheses

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 87, p. 218: `alpha0[sb] = - cov[sb][0][1] + alpha1[sb] *
  cplx_conj(cov[sb][1][2]);`, then divided by `cov[sb][1][1]`. The line computing `denom` drops `[sb]` from
  `cov[1][2]`.
- **Reading:** `alpha0 = -(cov01 + alpha1 conj(cov12)) / cov11`, the first normal equation of the covariance
  method the clause names, whose second gives `alpha1` as printed; and `cov[sb][1][2]`. The pair then
  whitens: a subband that follows a two-slot recursion returns its coefficients.
- **Evidence:** Text. The gold legs set `aspx_tna_mode` Light to Heavy in most noise groups, but decode to
  the same tile energies and log-spectral distance, within 0.1 dB, under either sign, so they do not decide
  it.

#### Pre-flattening's direction

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.6.4.1, pp. 217 to 220: pre-flattening derives "a gain value ... from a coarse
  approximation of the slope of the source range", and "the inverse of this gain value is applied during the
  patching process". Pseudocode 85 defines `gain_vec[sb] = pow(10, (mean_energy - slope[sb])/20)`, the gain
  that brings each subband of the fitted slope to the mean, and Pseudocode 89 multiplies the patch by
  `1/gain_vec[p]`. Together the two double the low band's slope in the patch, where the clause names the
  step pre-flattening and describes the fit as the slope to take out.
- **Reading:** the patch is multiplied by `gain_vec[p]`: the fitted slope is taken out of the low band as it
  is copied up, and each patched subband starts from the fit's mean level.
- **Why:** with `aspx_interpolation` set, as in every stream here, the envelope adjuster gains each subband
  to its envelope whatever the patch's shape; what the patch's slope changes is the limiter, which cuts a
  gain more than 3 dB over its limiter group's (Pseudocodes 96 to 101). A patch whose slope is doubled needs
  its largest gains at the top of each patch, where the limiter cuts them.
- **Evidence:** Streams, not all one way. Over G0's legs with content above the crossover, this reading
  brings the A-SPX tiles nearer the source's energy: 2.0 speech at 48 and 64 kbps from 2.4 and 2.8 dB to
  1.3 and 1.6 dB, with ViSQOL from 4.23 and 4.40 to 4.55 and 4.50; 2.0 music at 48 kbps from 2.7 to 1.5 dB;
  immersive stereo at 64 kbps from 3.1 to 1.7 dB; 5.1 film's centre from 5.2 to 1.9 dB at 192 kbps and from
  2.7 to 1.7 dB at 256 to 320. As printed, film's centre loses 4.6 to 10.9 dB in its first patch's top
  group, and at 256 kbps the limiter takes it all: the envelope adjuster's output before the limiter is
  within 0.3 dB of the envelope there, and 3.9 dB under it after. It takes them a little further on 2.0 music at 64 kbps and immersive stereo at 96,
  0.3 and 0.2 dB, and on 2.0 speech at 96 to 144 kbps, whose crossover is 13.5 kHz, from 2.4 to 3.1 dB,
  with ViSQOL 0.05 to 0.07 lower. librempeg's decodes of these legs sit level across the subband groups,
  1.2 to 2.2 dB under the source, in every one.

#### The first signal scale factor below zero

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 82, p. 215: `qscf_sig_sbg[0][atsg] == 0 && scf_sig_sbg[1][atsg] < 0`. No
  dequantised scale factor, `64 * 2^(qscf/a)`, is negative, so as printed the rule never applies.
- **Reading:** `qscf_sig_sbg[1][atsg] < 0`: an envelope coded along frequency whose first value is 0 and
  second negative takes the second group's scale factor for the first. The F0 codebooks send no negative
  value, and this lets an envelope start below their floor.
- **Evidence:** Observation. DEE relies on it in 265 of the 484 signal envelopes of its 96 to 144 kbps
  music legs, whose source is near silence above the crossover. With this reading the first group's
  energy, frame by frame, errs against the source within 2.2 dB of the second group's error; as printed,
  it sits 6.9 dB above it.

#### The sinusoid's subband

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 92, p. 222: `sb_mid = (int) 0.5*(sbz+sba);`, where C's cast binds to `0.5`
  and gives 0. The same lines reuse `sba` and `sbz` for the group's own borders.
- **Reading:** `(int)(0.5 * (sbz + sba))` over the group's borders relative to `sbx`: its middle subband,
  rounded down, as the paragraph before says ("the sinusoid is placed in the middle of the high-frequency
  resolution subband group").
- **Evidence:** Text; the speech legs add sinusoids in 35 frames each.

#### b_sine_at_end

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 95, p. 224, sets `b_sine_at_end` from this interval's `aspx_tsg_ptr` and
  never reads it; its test, like Pseudocode 99's, reads `p_sine_at_end`, which Pseudocode 92 sets from the
  previous interval's.
- **Reading:** as printed: `p_sine_at_end`, which makes the first envelope a transient's when the previous
  interval's transient was at its end. `b_sine_at_end` is unused.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### aspx_limiter

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.10.1.7, p. 98, turns the limiter off with `aspx_limiter` 0; clause 5.7.6.4.2.2 never
  tests it.
- **Reading:** with the limiter off, Pseudocodes 96 to 101 are skipped: the gains and levels go to the
  assembly unlimited and unboosted.
- **Evidence:** Text; every gold leg sets it.

#### The limiter's last group

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 72 to 74, p. 207, can remove `sbz` from `sbg_lim`, when it is no patch
  border and lies less than 0.245 octave above the border before it. Pseudocodes 96 and 100 then map the
  subbands above the table's last border to a group past its end.
- **Reading:** the last limiter group runs to `sbz`, in the sums of Pseudocodes 96 and 99 and in the gains.
- **Evidence:** Text. 168 of the 5,622 configurations and base rates a stream can select end the limiter
  table below `sbz`, and 232 end the patches below it (`tests/ac4/core/test_aspx.cpp`); DEE's do
  neither.

#### The noise and tone generators' indices

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 103 and 105, pp. 228 and 229: `noise_idx_prev[sb][ts]` and
  `sine_idx_prev[sb][ts]` are "the last noise_idx" and "the last sine_idx" "from the previous A-SPX
  interval", written as matrices; both add `ts - atsg_sig[0]`, a QMF slot less an A-SPX slot. Pseudocodes
  107 and 108 start their loops at `atsg_sig[0]`, without `num_ts_in_ats`.
- **Reading:** one running index each per channel, from the last one the previous interval used: the noise
  index counts on by `num_sb_aspx` a QMF slot and 1 a subband, the sine index by 1 a QMF slot, both from
  the interval's first QMF slot, `atsg_sig[0] * num_ts_in_ats`, where Pseudocodes 107 and 108 start too.
  `master_reset` restarts the noise index at 0, and the first frame starts the sine index at 1.
- **Evidence:** Text. Either way the noise and the tones take the same sequences; which entry a subband
  gets cannot be measured against a source.

#### What an I-frame does not restore

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.2.2, p. 72, calls an I-frame "independently decodable". Pseudocodes 103 and
  105, pp. 228 and 229, run A-SPX's noise and tone indices on from "the previous A-SPX interval", from
  `master_reset` and from "the codec initialization stage"; Pseudocode 111, p. 235, keeps A-CPL's
  decorrelator "filter states from previously processed frames", and the transient ducker (5.7.7.4.3)
  keeps its energies.
- **Reading:** a decoder that starts at an I-frame starts those states as at a stream's first frame: the
  indices at their first values, the filters and the ducker silent. Nothing in the stream restores them.
  The I-frame's own audio overlaps a frame the decoder never had. From the next frame's audio on, the
  waveform-coded signal is the one a decoder running from the stream's start gives; A-SPX's noise and
  tones come out at the same levels at another phase of their tables, and A-CPL's decorrelated signal
  converges on the other decoder's over a few frames.
- **Evidence:** Streams: `tests/ac4/decoder/test_decoder.cpp` decodes the committed DEE streams from
  each of their I-frames. The frame after the I-frame matches the decode from the start to under -100
  dBFS in SIMPLE, the QMF banks' transient, and to -50 dBFS in ASPX; in A-CPL the output is within -54
  dBFS of it by the fourth frame. DEE's first frame is a priming frame, and it and the second are both
  I-frames, so a decode from the second gives the stream's audio from the third frame on.

#### Interleaved waveform coding

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.6.5.2, p. 231, counts `aspx_tic_used_in_slot` in A-SPX slots "starting at the A-SPX
  timeslot that coincides with QMF timeslot 0"; 5.7.6.5.3 gives the output for frequency and time
  interleaving only.
- **Reading:** slot n covers the frame's output slots `n * num_ts_in_ats` to `(n + 1) * num_ts_in_ats - 1`,
  counted on Q_low's axis. Elsewhere the output is Q_low below `sbx` and the assembled `Y` from `sbx` to
  `sbz`, the waveform-coded input kept there only in a high resolution group `aspx_fic_used_in_sfb` marks,
  where it is added; above `sbz`, nothing but a time-interleaved slot's input.
- **Evidence:** Text; no gold leg interleaves.

#### Before the first interval

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.2 holds control data back `d_ctrl` frames; Pseudocodes 75, 80, 81, 86, 88, 92 and
  106 read the previous interval's state, and give its first value only for some of it.
- **Reading:** until a frame's control data comes due, the QMF matrix passes through as in SIMPLE mode. The
  previous Q_low, `Y` and envelopes are silence, `aspx_tna_mode_prev` and the chirp factors 0 (as
  5.7.6.4.1.3 says), `aspx_tsg_ptr_prev` -1, and `master_reset` is set at the first configuration. The
  first envelope's time deltas start from 0 at the resolution it has.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Scale factors far out of range

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.6.3.5: dequantisation raises 2 to a sum of transmitted deltas, which a stream that is
  not audio can take anywhere.
- **Reading:** the exponent is clamped to +-96 before `2^x`, and the output to +-10^9 of full scale before
  it becomes `float`: no stream DEE writes comes near, and every value the decoder computes stays finite.
- **Evidence:** Text; `fuzz_ac4_decode`.

### Immersive decoding

The readings phase D9 takes to decode the immersive element (Part 2 clauses 5.2 to 5.5), in full and in
core decoding (4.7). They are the decoder's alone, as under "Reconstruction". The evidence is DEE's
5.1.4 legs, scored against their sources (`tools/checks/score_ac4_decode.py`): in SCPL and ASPX_SCPL
every one of the ten tones comes out on its own channel to 0.02 dB (the LFE's 0.26 dB is DEE's
low-pass), and in core decoding at the core's gains; the constructed streams of
`tests/ac4/decoder/constructed.cpp` reach the groupings, steps and modes DEE does not write. librempeg,
the one other decoder here, does not decode the element: its L, R and C come out 6 to 9 dB down, its
surrounds 12 to 15 dB down, all four top tones in its Lb at -15 dB, and its top channels silent, so no
reading below rests on it.

#### Table 19's track numbers are labels

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 19, p. 60: each row gives an element's input tracks as `[i]`, "Tracks Oi" by NOTE
  1, and its outputs. For `core_5ch_grouping` 0 and 2 the numbers do not follow the order the syntax reads
  the elements in: the `mono_data()` read third is `[6]`, and the two-channel elements after it `[4,5]`,
  `[7,8]` and `[9,10]`.
- **Reading:** the numbers are names. Each element's outputs go to the signals its row gives, in the order
  the syntax reads the elements, as step 1's reference to Part 1 5.3.3 makes them: grouping 0 with
  `2ch_mode` 0 gives [A, B], [D, E], C, [F, G], [H, I], [J, K]; `2ch_mode` 1 [A, D] and [B, E] first.
- **Evidence:** Streams, for grouping 0 with `2ch_mode` 0, DEE's only one; Text for the rest.

#### The EXAMPLE after Table 19

- **Where:** Part 2 5.2.3.2, p. 60: "Let core_5ch_grouping = 1. Processing the first two_channel_data
  element ... produces outputs O0,O1. The outputs are assigned to tracks E, D."
- **Reading:** Table 19's row: in grouping 1 the first `two_channel_data()`, read after
  `three_channel_data()`, gives [3,4], D and E in that order. The example contradicts the row twice, in
  the outputs' numbers and in their order.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Step 4's NOTE 2 names F' for H'

- **Where:** Part 2 5.2.3.2, NOTE 2, p. 60: "Only the signals D, E, F, and G are modified in this step; all
  others are passed through into A' through C' and F' through M'."
- **Reading:** H' through M': F' and G' are two of the four the step modifies.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Table 20's prediction gains

- **Where:** Part 2 5.2.3.2 step 5, p. 60: "If the sap_mode = full SAP, the parameters a'j shall be
  extracted from n_elem chparam_info elements ... Otherwise, the parameters a'j shall be set to 0." Nothing
  says how a gain is extracted from a `chparam_info()`, which carries a 2 x 2 matrix per band (Part 1
  5.3.2).
- **Reading:** a'_j is Pseudocode 59's `sap_gain`, alpha_q times 0.1, band by band: in the bands whose
  `sap_coeff_used` is set when `sap_mode` is 3 (full SAP), and 0 in the other bands and for every other
  `sap_mode`, M/S included. Table 20 then applies H'' = H' + a'_0 D' band by band as a 2 x 2 step (1, 0,
  a'_0, 1) under the framing of D ("The framing of the immersive element's chparam_info()"), and alike for
  I, J and K.
- **Why:** full SAP's matrix is Part 1's prediction of the second channel from the first, (1 + g, 1; 1 - g,
  -1); its gain is the one value per band the step can take.
- **Evidence:** Streams. DEE's SCPL and ASPX_SCPL streams send these four `chparam_info()` with `sap_mode`
  3 in nearly every frame and `sap_mode` 2 in the rest (the 237 frames of G0's `514-music-768`: 236 for
  each surround pair, 216 and 220 for the top pairs), and the ten tones of its 5.1.4 legs decode with this
  reading each on its own channel (`tools/checks/score_ac4_decode.py`).
  Phase E8's encoder writes them the same way (`src/ac4/ERRATA.md`, "Table 20's prediction").

#### ASPX_ACPL_2 and step 4

- **Where:** Part 2 5.2.3.3, p. 61, assigns A to G to A' to G' and silences H' to K', with no step 4; the
  syntax (6.2.4.1) reads `b_use_sap_add_ch` and step 4's two `chparam_info()` in every 7CH_STATIC mode,
  ASPX_ACPL_2 among them.
- **Reading:** where ASPX_ACPL_2 sends step 4's parameters, the step applies as in 5.2.3.2: D, E, F and G
  come out of it before A-CPL takes D'' to G''.
- **Why:** the parameters describe how F and G were coded against D and E; A' to G' without the step would
  be the coded tracks, not the channels' signals.
- **Evidence:** Text. DEE sets `b_use_sap_add_ch` 0 in ASPX_ACPL_2.

#### Which channel holds which intermediate signal

- **Where:** Part 2 5.2.2.2 and NOTE 3 after step 6, p. 60: the tool's outputs A'' to K'' "are not assigned
  to dedicated channels until they have passed either one of the coupling tools (S-CPL/A-CPL) or the A-JCC
  tool"; Table 8, p. 46, names the A-SPX inputs by channel in ASPX_SCPL and as A'' to G'' otherwise.
- **Reading:** A'' is held in L, B'' in R, C'' in C, D'' in Ls, E'' in Rs, F'' in Tfl, G'' in Tfr, H'' in
  Lb, I'' in Rb, J'' in Tbl and K'' in Tbr, the channel each becomes: S-CPL's Table 23 makes (Ls, Lb) of D''
  and H'' and alike, Table 25 gives A-CPL's modules (Ls, Lb), (Rs, Rb), (Tfl, Tbl) and (Tfr, Tbr) from x5,
  x6, x9 and x10, and core decoding's Table 24 makes L to Tfr of A'' to G''.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's legs decode each tone to its own channel in all three of its modes.

#### S-CPL on the inverse transform's own frame

- **Where:** Part 2 5.3.1, p. 63: S-CPL "operates in the time domain, processing the output of the IMDCT";
  Part 1 5.6 then aligns that output by `d_pcm` samples before the QMF analysis.
- **Reading:** S-CPL takes each frame's inverse transform output with that frame's codec mode, before the
  frame alignment. Within a codec mode the order makes no difference; where the mode changes at an I-frame,
  each frame's samples take their own frame's gains. A concealed frame takes the last decoded frame's.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### The core's top pair is Tsl and Tsr

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 24, p. 64, names S-CPL's core outputs L, R, C, Ls, Rs, Tfl and Tfr; A-JCC's core
  outputs (5.6.3.5.3, p. 77) end with Tsl and Tsr; Tables 45 and 46, p. 108, render a 7.X.X input's core
  from r12,12 and r13,13, the indices of Tsl and Tsr (5.10.2.2).
- **Reading:** core decoding's top pair is Tsl and Tsr in every mode, F'' and G'' times the mode's gain:
  the core is a 5.X.2 layout (Table 71), whose top pair is the side pair (Table A.27), and each of its two
  channels carries the sum of a front and a back top channel.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's legs in core decoding put the Tfl and Tbl tones in the first of the pair,
  3 dB down, as Table 45's +3 dB expects.

#### Core decoding's A-SPX on the first channel of a pair

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 8, p. 46, NOTE 6: in core decoding in ASPX_SCPL, "Channels in square brackets are
  processed with the first of two channels of one aspx_data_2ch() element": [Ls], [Rs], [Tfl], [Tfr].
- **Reading:** each such `aspx_data_2ch()` is decoded whole: its second channel's envelopes are decoded
  into state kept for it, since the next frame's differences along time and `aspx_balance`'s level and
  balance need them, with a silent low band, and its output is not used. The first channel's output is the
  core channel's, which the A-SPX post-processing (5.4) and the gain of 2 (4.8.3.11.2) then take.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's ASPX_SCPL leg in core decoding.

#### A-JCC's interpolation takes each module's own framing

- **Where:** Part 2 Pseudocode 6, p. 70, reads `ajcc_interpolation_type` and `ajcc_param_timeslot`
  without saying whose; `ajcc_data()` (6.2.6.1) sends an `ajcc_framing_data()` for each side, `ajcc_nps_l`
  and `ajcc_nps_r`, and Pseudocodes 8 and 12 pass `num_pset_1` and `num_pset_2` from them.
- **Reading:** the left module (`ajcc_module_2()` or `_4()` for L) interpolates with the left framing's
  type, parameter sets and time slots, the right module with the right's, as A-CPL's modules each take
  their own `acpl_data_1ch()`'s ("Each module interpolates with its own acpl_data_1ch()").
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed A-JCC streams, whose framings agree.

#### A-JCC's coefficients interpolate from their own ajcc_param_prev

- **Where:** Part 2 Pseudocodes 6 and 7, pp. 70 and 71: `ajcc_param_prev[sb]` holds "the dequantized
  A-JCC parameters from the previous AC-4 frame related to the provided ajcc_param[pset][pb] array", and
  Pseudocodes 11 and 14 interpolate their d and w arrays, built from the parameters, not the parameters.
- **Reading:** each of a module's coefficient arrays (d0 to d9 and w0 to w14 in full decoding, d0 to d5
  and w0 to w5 in core) keeps its own `ajcc_param_prev`, its last set's values, 0 before the first frame.
  Within one `ajcc_core_mode` this is the same as interpolating the parameters; where the core mode
  changes, each coefficient ramps from what it was, alongside Pseudocode 9's crossfade.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### A-JCC values outside their range

- **Where:** Part 2 5.6.3.2, p. 69: alpha and beta dequantise by Part 1 Tables 203 to 206, which end at
  their quantised values' range; dry and wet by a step, for any value.
- **Reading:** a frame whose differential decoding takes an alpha or beta outside its table, or a dry or
  wet outside its F0 codebook's range (0 to 22 fine and 0 to 11 coarse for dry, 0 to 40 and 0 to 20 for
  wet), is refused as invalid, as A-CPL's are ("Values outside the dequantisation tables").
- **Evidence:** Text; `fuzz_ac4_decode`.

#### ajcc_core_mode_prev before the first frame

- **Where:** Part 2 Pseudocode 9, p. 74: "The helper variable ajcc_core_mode_prev shall be initialized
  to ajcc_core_mode."
- **Reading:** it takes the `ajcc_core_mode` of the first frame A-JCC applies to, so that frame's
  pre-modification takes no ramp; after a change of codec mode, which starts A-JCC afresh ("A change of
  codec mode"), it takes the next frame's again.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Core decoding of the Part 1 elements

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8.3.1, p. 41: in core decoding, for A-CPL "gain factors shall be applied instead";
  4.8.3.14, p. 48, gives the factor, 2, for the immersive element alone, and says the decoder "shall
  utilize the A-CPL tool" of Part 1 for the other elements. Part 2 Table 71, p. 171, gives no core channel
  mode for the Part 1 channel modes.
- **Reading:** core decoding changes only the immersive element; the Part 1 elements decode as in full
  decoding, A-CPL included.
- **Evidence:** Text.

### The 22.2 element

Part 2's 22_2_channel_element (6.2.4.3): two LFE tracks and eleven pairs, in the SIMPLE and ASPX codec
modes. The decoder decodes it in full decoding to 24 channels. No stream of it exists here and no other
decoder reads one, so every reading below rests on the text: the constructed streams of
`tests/ac4/decoder/constructed.cpp` (`22_2-simple-alternating` and `22_2-aspx-unit7-lr`) carry a
tone on each channel and are read by both transcriptions of the syntax, and they show that the decoder
does what the readings say, not that they are what an encoder meant.

#### The 22.2 element's tracks

- **Where:** Part 2 5.2.4 and Table 21, p. 62; 5.2.2.1, p. 58 (nSAP 22); 4.8.3.6, p. 45; 6.2.4.3, p. 130. Table 21 numbers the
  inputs 0 to 23 and gives each its output: `mono_data[0]` is [LFE], `mono_data[1]` [LFE2],
  `two_channel_data[0]` [L, R], then [C, Tc], [Ls, Rs], [Lb, Rb], [Tfl, Tfr], [Tbl, Tbr], [Tsl, Tsr],
  [Tfc, Tbc], [Bfl, Bfr], [Bfc, Cb] and [Lw, Rw]. 4.8.3.6 sends the tracks of the first two `sf_data`
  elements straight to the IMDCT stage, round the stereo and multichannel processing.
- **Reading:** the tracks are those the syntax reads, in its order. Each pair is Part 1 5.3.3's
  processing on its own `b_enable_mdct_stereo_proc` and `chparam_info()`, and nothing mixes tracks of
  different pairs: no step in the text does. Unlike Tables 180 and 182 the table numbers the LFEs, so the
  two `mono_data(1)` are tracks 0 and 1 and the pairs follow, and the Part 1 reading of the LFE's track
  ("The LFE's track is not numbered in Tables 180 and 182") is not needed.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### The 22.2 element's output

- **Where:** Part 2 Table A.27, p. 214, lists 22.2's speakers by speaker index, which skips 14 and 15
  (reserved) and 24 and 25 (Lscr and Rscr, which 22.2 does not have); Part 2 5.10.2, Tables 35 to 43,
  pp. 104 to 107, have no row for a 22.2 input; Table 8, p. 46, lists 22.2 as "Only full decoding
  supported".
- **Reading:** decode() writes the 24 channels in Table A.27's order by speaker index: L, R, C, Ls, Rs,
  Lb, Rb, Tfl, Tfr, Tbl, Tbr, LFE, Tsl, Tsr, Tfc, Tbc, Tc, LFE2, Bfl, Bfr, Bfc, Cb, Lw, Rw. The LFE comes
  after Tbr and LFE2 after Tc, where that table has them, not fourth as the Part 1 modes have it. The
  output is delivered as coded. Every other `DownmixTarget` is refused, with `kUnsupported` and a reason
  naming 22.2, since no table renders a 22.2 input and Part 1 Tables 217 to 219 take 5.X and 7.X inputs:
  folding 22.2 by them would leave out most of its channels without saying so. The other elements come out
  as coded for the immersive targets (as the header of `decoder.hpp` says); a 22.2 source is refused for
  them too, since it is wider than any of those layouts rather than narrower. Core decoding of the
  element is refused for Table 8's "only full decoding": the element has no core channel mode (Table 71).
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Dialogue enhancement's channels for 22.2

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 15, p. 49, gives "9.X.4, 22.2" the channels "Lscr, Rscr, C". Table A.27 has
  no Lscr or Rscr in its 22.2 column. Table 13, p. 48, sends 22.2 to Part 1 5.7.8, whose 5.7.8.2, p. 248,
  calls the processed channels "the three front channels", and whose Table 171 names them L, R and C.
- **Reading:** 22.2's dialogue enhancement channels are L, R and C, as for 5.X, 7.X and 7.X.4, and as the
  tool's own `de_channel_config` names them. The printed row is 9.X.4's, which gives that layout's screen
  pair; 22.2 has no such pair, and its L and R are its front pair (the wides Lw and Rw are channels of
  their own). The reading for 9.X.4 is "Dialogue enhancement's channels for 9.X.4".
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### No companding, S-CPL or A-CPL for 22.2

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8.3.10.2 and 4.8.3.10.3, p. 45, list the elements companding applies to, and
  22.2 is not among them; 4.8.3.8, p. 45, bypasses S-CPL for every element but the immersive one;
  4.8.3.14, p. 48: "For decoding of 22_2_channel_element, no A-CPL processing is required"; 6.2.4.3's
  syntax has no `companding_control()` and no A-CPL data.
- **Reading:** the element's QMF domain has A-SPX alone, and only in ASPX: eleven `aspx_data_2ch()` over the
  pairs Table 8 gives, each pair's two channels together, as Part 1 6.2.10 processes a pair. The LFEs have no
  A-SPX data and pass through. Nothing in the text gives the pairs a gain after A-SPX, as 4.8.3.11 gives
  ASPX_SCPL's channels, so none is applied.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### DRC's groups and level for 22.2

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 69, p. 170, gives 22.2 four groups: "L, R, [LFE, LFE2], Lw, Rw", C, "Ls, Rs, Lb, Rb,
  Bfl, Bfr, Bfc, Cb" and "Tfl, Tfr, Tbl, Tbr, Tsl, Tsr, Tfc, Tbc, Tc", with the brackets meaning that
  the LFEs are part of the group where the configuration has them; 4.8.3.16, p. 49, and 4.8.6, p. 53, take
  the groups from that table. Part 1 5.7.9.3.1.1 leaves the level detector to the implementation.
- **Reading:** the groups numbered 1 to 4 in the table are the gain sets 0 to 3 of `nr_drc_channels` 4; both
  LFEs are in the first. The level detector takes neither LFE (BS.1770's weight for the LFE is none) and
  the other channels at the weights it gives the 7.X modes' channels.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Mixing into a 22.2 substream

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.12.4.9 and Table 216 pan a mixed substream over the horizontal speakers of the
  main audio's layout; no table gives 22.2's.
- **Reading:** a substream mixed into a 22.2 main substream is panned over the horizontal channels the
  layout has, L, C, R, Lw, Rw, Ls, Rs, Lb and Rb at the azimuths a 7.X layout gives them, the Ls and Rs
  at the sides; the top, bottom and centre-back channels are not in the ring.
- **Evidence:** Text; as for 7.X, no stream mixes into a 22.2 substream.

### The 9.X.4 element

Part 2's immersive_channel_element (6.2.4.1) with `b_5fronts` 1, which codes the channel modes 13 and 14,
9.0.4 and 9.1.4: the 7.X.4 modes' channels and the screen pair, Lscr and Rscr, in all five codec modes
(SCPL, ASPX_SCPL, ASPX_ACPL_1, ASPX_ACPL_2, ASPX_AJCC). No stream of it exists here and no other decoder
reads one, so every reading below rests on the text. The constructed streams of
`tests/ac4/decoder/constructed.cpp` (`9_0_4-*` and `9_1_4-*`) carry a distinct tone on each channel and
are read by both transcriptions of the syntax, and they show that the decoder does what the readings say,
not that they are what an encoder meant.

#### The 9.X.4 element's tracks

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.4.1, pp. 128 and 129 (the third `two_channel_data()` and two further
  `chparam_info()` that `b_5fronts` adds); 5.2.3.2 step 5, p. 60; Tables 19 and 20, pp. 60 and 61.
  Step 5 prints "n_elem = 6 b_5fronts ≠ 0 and 0 ≤ j < n_elem" with the case split lost, and Table 20's
  `b_5fronts` 1 matrix adds the rows L'' = L' + a'_4 A' and M'' = M' + a'_5 B'.
- **Reading:** the element has 13 tracks, A'' to M'', and L'' and M'' are the last pair of Table 19,
  after the tracks of the 7.X.4 element. a'_0 to a'_3 are the first four `chparam_info()` and a'_4 and a'_5
  the last two, as the syntax orders them; the pair [L, M]'s own `chparam_info()` (its stereo
  processing, Part 1 5.3.3) is read inside its `two_channel_data()`, which the syntax places between
  the four and the two, and is not one of the six. The prediction, like the other four, is a'_j times the
  track of the first pair (A' and B') added to the track, per band, with the sap_mode of the `chparam_info()`
  it comes from; sap_mode 0 sets a' to 0.
- **Evidence:** Text. The constructed streams `9_1_4-scpl-grouping1-matsel2-prediction` and
  `9_1_4-acpl1-grouping3-matsel8-prediction` predict L and M at a non-zero alpha_q. A first reading took
  a'_4 and a'_5 from the two `chparam_info()` that follow the pair's own in the decoder's list; the tones
  of Lscr and Rscr came out on the wrong channels and the test caught it.

#### The 9.X.4 element's S-CPL channels

- **Where:** Part 2 5.3.3.1, Table 23, p. 64: for `b_5fronts` 1 the table prints a second mapping, of
  (A'', L'', B'', M'') to four outputs it labels "Lw, Lscr, Rw, Rscr" with the factor 2 x ½ and no
  `c_gain` or `m_gain`; Table 24 for core decoding takes the first seven tracks. Table 8, p. 46, pairs the
  channels A-SPX processes as (L, Lscr) and (R, Rscr), and 9.X.4 has no Lw or Rw (Table A.27).
- **Reading:** the labels Lw and Rw of Table 23 are L and R: L = A'' + L'' and Lscr = A'' − L'', and R =
  B'' + M'' and Rscr = B'' − M'' (½ ± ½ times 2), not scaled by `c_gain`, which only C takes (2 in SCPL, 1
  in ASPX_SCPL); the printed 5.1-style rows for Ls to Tbr are the 7.X.4 element's. In core decoding Table
  24 is the 7.X.4 core's, with L and R from A'' and B'' at `c_gain`.
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed SCPL and ASPX_SCPL streams put each of the 13 tones on its channel.

#### The 9.X.4 element's A-SPX

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8.3.11, Tables 8 and 9, p. 46, and Table 11, p. 47; 6.2.4.1, p. 129. Table 8 lists
  the channels of the ASPX_SCPL core mode as "[Ls], [Rs], C, (L, R), [Tfl], [Tfr]" for every `b_5fronts`
  ("X"), and the syntax sends, with `b_5fronts` 1, two `aspx_data_2ch()` in the place of the one that
  holds L and R, so that no unit holds both. Table 9 lists "L, R, Ls, Rs, Tfl, Tfr" for post-processing
  with `b_5fronts` 1.
- **Reading:** full decoding in ASPX_SCPL processes seven units in the order the syntax sends them:
  (Ls, Lb), (Rs, Rb), C, (L, Lscr), (R, Rscr), (Tfl, Tbl), (Tfr, Tbr). Core decoding reads the same seven
  and takes the first channel of each two-channel unit, as the square brackets of Table 8 say: L from the
  fourth unit and R from the fifth, where Table 8 prints "(L, R)" as one pair. In the A-CPL
  and A-JCC modes the units are Table 8's (A'', B''), (D'', E''), (F'', G'') and C'', and L'' and M''
  have no A-SPX data of their own. The gains of ASPX_SCPL in full decoding are Table 11's: 2 for C, 1 for
  L, Lscr, R and Rscr, and the square root of 2 for the others; the core's are g = 2 for the channels of
  Table 9 and none for the rest.
- **Evidence:** Text; `9_0_4-aspx_scpl-grouping0-2ch1-unit3` makes the fourth unit loud and finds its
  high band on L and Lscr alone.

#### The 9.X.4 element's A-CPL

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8.3.14 and Table 12, p. 48; 5.5.2 and Pseudocode 2, p. 67 (Table 25, p. 66);
  6.2.4.1, p. 129 (`acpl_data_1ch()` six times with `b_5fronts`).
- **Reading:** the six modules are Pseudocode 2's four, on (Ls, Lb), (Rs, Rb), (Tfl, Tbl) and (Tfr, Tbr),
  then the fifth on (L, Lscr) and the sixth on (R, Rscr) with the fifth and sixth `acpl_data_1ch()`
  (Table 25: x0 / x3 to z0 / z1 and x1 / x4 to z2 / z3); these two decorrelate with D2, each module
  with a decorrelator of its own, as the first four use D0, D0, D1 and D1. In ASPX_ACPL_1 the residual
  inputs x3 and x4 are the tracks L'' and M''; in ASPX_ACPL_2 they are 0. Pseudocode 2 prints
  `u4 = inputSignalModification(x0in)` and `u5 = ... (x1in)` before the lines that assign `x0in = 2*x0`
  and `x1in = 2*x1`; the assignments come first, as they do for x5in to x10in. With `b_5fronts` the
  outputs of the fifth and sixth modules (z0 to z3) are not scaled by the square root of 2, C is twice
  its input, and the outputs of the first four modules are scaled by it as before. Core decoding applies
  g = 2 to each present channel instead and no A-CPL (4.8.3.14).
- **Evidence:** Text; `9_0_4-acpl2-grouping2-second` and the ASPX_ACPL_1 stream route each module's
  downmix to its first or second output and find the tone on the one channel.

#### The 9.X.4 element's A-JCC

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.6.1 (`ajcc_data(b_5fronts)`), p. 133; 5.6.3, Tables 26 and 27, pp. 68 and 71;
  Pseudocodes 8, 10, 12 and 13, pp. 73 to 78.
- **Reading:** with `b_5fronts` the data are `ajcc_qm_f` and `ajcc_qm_b` and four modules' framing, and
  twenty parameters in the order dry1f to dry4f, dry1b to dry4b, wet1f to wet6f, wet1b to wet6b; the
  modules lf, rf, lb and rb take dry1 and dry2, dry3 and dry4 and wet1 to wet3 or wet4 to wet6 of the front
  or the back set. Full decoding is four `ajcc_module_1()` (Pseudocode 10) and core decoding two
  `ajcc_module_3()` (Pseudocode 13); Pseudocode 10's coefficients d0 to d2 are dry1, dry2 and
  1 − dry1 − dry2, followed by y0's p0, p2 and p4 and y1's p1, p3 and p5. Each coefficient is
  interpolated with the framing of the half it comes from. Eight decorrelator instances, D0, D2, D1, D2 on
  each side, serve the full modules and the core takes four.
- **Evidence:** Text; `9_1_4-ajcc-grouping1-route2` and its siblings send each route (a module's input
  whole to one output) and the tones come out on the channels the route names, in full and core decoding.

#### The 9.X.4 element's output

- **Where:** Part 2 Table A.27, p. 214: the 9.X.4 column lists L, R, C, Ls, Rs, Lb, Rb, Tfl, Tfr, Tbl, Tbr,
  the LFE (index 11), and the screen pair at 24 and 25; Table 8, p. 46, and Table 71, p. 171, for the core.
- **Reading:** decode() writes the thirteen or fourteen channels in Table A.27's order by speaker
  index: L, R, C, Ls, Rs, Lb, Rb, Tfl, Tfr, Tbl, Tbr, LFE, Lscr, Rscr (the LFE after the tops, as for 22.2).
  Core decoding is the 7.X.4 core's 5.X.2 (L, R, C, [LFE], Ls, Rs, Tsl, Tsr): its channels are those of the
  seven first tracks, and the screen pair is not in it.
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed streams.

#### The 9.X.4 element's rendering

- **Where:** Part 2 5.10.2.4 and 5.10.2.5, Tables 34 to 43, pp. 104 to 107; Tables 128 to 130, pp. 207 and
  208; Table 127, p. 206; 4.8.5.3, p. 52. Tables 38 to 43 have a 9.X.4, 9.X.2 and 9.X.0 row, with
  r0,22 = r1,23 = gain_f1 and r2,22 = r2,23 = gain_f2 (Tables 39 to 43, from 9.X.4 and 9.X.2), or
  r0,22 = r1,23 = 0 dB (Table 38, and every table from 9.X.0). Table 128 gives gain_f1 as 3.0 to −6.0 dB and
  then −∞ (default −∞, Table 130), and Table 129 gives gain_f2 as 0 to −12 dB then −∞ (default 0 dB).
  Tables 35 to 37 render to 9.X outputs.
- **Reading:** the 9.X rows of Tables 38 to 43 are rendered as printed, with the two gain labels taken the
  other way round: the coefficient the rows print gain_f1, on L and R (from Lscr and Rscr), is Table
  129's gain_f2 (default 0 dB), and the one printed gain_f2, on C, is Table 128's gain_f1 (default
  −∞). 6.2.9.4, p. 153, sends `b_put_screen_to_c` and then `gain_f1_code` if it is 1 and `gain_f2_code`
  if not; 6.3.10.3.3, p. 207, says the flag says whether Lscr and Rscr "are mixed into the Centre
  channel C"; and Table 130 defaults the flag to False, gain_f1 to −∞ and gain_f2 to 0 dB. So gain_f1 is the gain of the screen
  pair into C and gain_f2 that into L and R, and printed the other way round the defaults would drop the
  pair from L and R and put it into C, against Table 38's r0,22 = r1,23 = 0 dB. The flag chooses the
  destination: with `b_put_screen_to_c` 1 the pair goes to C at gain_f1 and the gain into L and R is −∞,
  with 0 it goes to L and R at gain_f2 and the gain into C is −∞ (the text says only "mixed into C").
  A 9.X source's Lb and Rb are always in its input configuration, as the 9.X rows give them
  coefficients and `bs_ch_config` 0 and 3 are the "back present" values of a 9.X mode (6.2.9.2);
  `b_4_back_channels_present` does not narrow them. The 7.X.4 and 5.X targets are rendered; a 9.X
  output (Tables 35 to 37) has no `out_ch_config` in Table 127 and is no `DownmixTarget`, so is refused.
  Folding the screen pair is a downmix and takes the output's loudness correction; as coded does not
  (4.8.5.3).
- **Evidence:** Text: `tests/ac4/decoder/test_renderer.cpp` holds the 9.X rows a second time, as printed,
  against the matrices for every output and every input; no stream sends `b_put_screen_to_c`, `gain_f1_code` or `gain_f2_code`.

#### Dialogue enhancement's channels for 9.X.4

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 15, p. 49: "9.X.4, 22.2: Lscr, Rscr, C"; Table 13, p. 48: 9.X.4 in SCPL, ASPX_SCPL
  and ASPX_ACPL_1 uses Part 1 5.7.8 in core and full decoding; in ASPX_ACPL_2 and ASPX_AJCC full
  decoding uses Part 1 5.7.8 and core decoding clauses 5.8.2.2 and 5.8.2.1.
- **Reading:** in full decoding the first, second and third channels of `de_channel_config` (Part 1 Table
  171's bits 4, 2 and 1) are Lscr, Rscr and C, and L and R pass unchanged. In core decoding, which has no
  screen pair, Part 1's tool for SCPL, ASPX_SCPL and ASPX_ACPL_1 processes the core's L, R and C, since
  those carry the channels (A'' to C'') the screen pair is coded with. (The 22.2 reading, L, R and C, is
  kept: see "Dialogue enhancement's channels for 22.2".)
- **Evidence:** Text; `dialogue enhancement raises 9.X.4's Lscr, Rscr and C, not L and R` makes each tone 9 dB
  louder on the channels asked and leaves the rest within 0.3 dB.

#### Core decoding's dialogue enhancement for 9.X.4

- **Where:** Part 2 5.8.2.1 and 5.8.2.2, pp. 92 to 96, Pseudocodes 19 to 21, and 4.8.3.15, p. 49 ("If
  b_de_simulcast is true, the decoder shall use the second de_data in dialog_enhancement for the core
  decoding mode"). The tool computes y = (M_interp | I) (m, u): u is the core's L, R and C, m the three
  inputs of the A-JCC (A'', B'', C'') or A-CPL (a, b, c) tool, M_interp the interpolation of the Part 1
  matrix Ĥ_DE,MC less the identity, per input, times the coefficients C_L and C_R (1 for C).
- **Reading:**
  - 5.8.2.2 prints `y = H_DE,ACPL,Core x (...)` with H = (M_interp | I), a 3 x 6 matrix, and defines
    the three A-CPL inputs `m` but no `u`; 5.8.2.1 has both. `u` is taken as 5.8.2.1 has
    it, the core's L, R and C that Table 8's core decoding produces (A-CPL's replacement gain applied).
    Ĥ_DE,Core is Ĥ_DE,MC (3 x 6, Part 1 5.7.8.6: the parametric 3 x 3 part and the waveform part) times
    the 6 x 3 matrix [I; 0] less the 3 x 3 identity, that is, the parametric part less the identity,
    the waveform part having no core counterpart (see "Dialogue enhancement without its waveform").
  - The scale of m is not given. Qin_AJCC are the A-SPX outputs, and the core computes with them as
    x0in = (2 + 1/√2) x0 (Pseudocode 12), so that u is at that scale. m is taken at the scale u is made
    at: for A-JCC the A-SPX output times Pseudocode 12's input gain, for A-CPL the A-SPX output with the
    replacement gain of 4.8.3.14 applied (g = 2, which core decoding gives instead of A-CPL). With that
    scale a core channel that a module fills whole with its input (C = 1) is raised by 1 + g x p, the
    factor full decoding raises Lscr by, and at the other scales it would be raised by a different
    one for no reason the text gives.
  - Pseudocode 20 is taken with its evident corrections. `ts++` inside the loops for the steep cases
    would skip a timeslot; the value assigned at `ts == psts` is kept and the loop moves on. The ramps
    divide by `psts`, which is 0 for a parameter set at the frame's first timeslot, and by
    `num_qmf_timeslots − psts − 1`, which is 0 at the last: a zero denominator is a step to the target. The
    interpolation reaches its target at the last timeslot, `(ts + 1) / N`, as Pseudocode 6 does for A-CPL.
    `Mprev`, `de_param_prev` and `coeff_prev` start at 0, so the first frame fades in.
  - C_L and C_R come from Pseudocodes 19 and 21 with the framing of the front modules (A-JCC) or of the
    fifth and sixth `acpl_data_1ch()` (A-CPL); in A-CPL the coefficient is ½ (1 − alpha1), so a module that
    sends the downmix to the second output (alpha −1) has C = 1 and one that sends it to the first
    has 0. A-CPL's `acpl_num_param_bands` and A-JCC's `ajcc_num_param_bands` map the subbands (sb_to_pb).
  - If `b_de_simulcast` is 1, core decoding takes the second `de_data()` (4.8.3.15), which sends no panning
    of its own and takes the first's (6.2.7.6).
- **Evidence:** Text; unit tests of the interpolation (smooth with one and two sets, steep) against
  hand-worked values, and constructed streams (`dialogue enhancement ... core`) that find the core's L, R and C
  louder by 1 + C g p on each route of A-JCC and of A-CPL, and unchanged where the second `de_data()` is 0.

#### DRC's groups for 9.X.4

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 69, p. 170: 9.X.4 has four groups, "L, R, [LFE], Lscr, Rscr", C, "Ls, Rs, Lb, Rb"
  and "Tfl, Tfr, Tbl, Tbr"; 4.8.3.16, p. 49.
- **Reading:** Lscr and Rscr join the first group with L, R and the LFE; the level detector weighs them as
  front channels (1) and the LFE not at all. Core decoding discards the gains of the channels it does not
  have, as for 7.X.4.
- **Evidence:** Text; `tests/ac4/decoder/test_drc.cpp`.

#### Mixing into a 9.X.4 substream

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.12.4.9 and Table 216 pan a mixed substream over the horizontal speakers of the main
  audio's layout; no table gives 9.X.4's.
- **Reading:** as for 22.2: the ring is the horizontal channels of the 7.X layout, L, C, R, Ls, Rs, Lb and Rb
  with the surrounds at the sides; the screen pair, the tops and the LFE are not in it.
- **Evidence:** Text; as for 7.X, no stream mixes into a 9.X.4 substream.

### 96 and 192 kHz

Part 1 clause 5.4 and 6.2.5.2 are all the text says of decoding a substream at 96 or 192 kHz. The
HSF extension substream holds "the scale factor and spectral data beyond 24 kHz" (4.2.4.3); a decoder
capable of these rates "shall read the additional data up to either twice the original block length
(for 96 kHz) or four times the original block length (for 192 kHz), and continue processing at twice or
four times the block length and sampling rate"; "streams containing high sampling frequency data do not
employ any of the QMF domain tools"; and decoding the extension needs the SAP tool and the IMDCT, and
"no QMF domain processing". The readings below fill in what that leaves. No stream at these rates was
available to read or to decode: the streams under `tests/golden/ac4-hsf/` and
`tests/ac4/decoder/test_hsf.cpp`'s are built from the text alone (`tests/ac4/decoder/hsf.hpp` says
how), the evidence for a reading is that the second transcription reads them alike and that the
decoder's output is the tones they were made from.

#### The rate a 96 or 192 kHz substream decodes at

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 89, p. 78, gives a substream's sampling frequency from `sf_multiplier`; 6.2.15,
  p. 268, and Part 2 4.8.8, p. 53, say the decoder "may" (Part 1) or "shall" (Part 2) "be operated at
  external sampling frequencies of 48 kHz, 96 kHz, or 192 kHz", with a converter by Table 83's ratio;
  5.4, p. 184, that a capable decoder "may be configured to these higher rates", and one that is not "shall
  ignore the additional coefficients". Nothing says what an external rate of 96 kHz does to a stream at
  48 kHz, or to one at 96 kHz decoded at 192.
- **Reading:** a substream with `sf_multiplier` decodes at its own sampling frequency, 96 000 or 192 000 Hz:
  `DecodedFrame::sample_rate_hz` says so, and so do `PresentationInfo::sample_rate_hz` and the blocks of
  `decode_by_block()`. A frame is Table 83's frame_length for the rate, twice or four times `frame_len_base`,
  of blocks Tables 99 to 105 give, with the band tables of Annex B for the longer length (Tables B.2 and B.3
  and the 96 and 192 kHz columns of B.4 to B.7). A stream at 48 kHz is not converted to a higher rate. This
  decoder is capable of the higher rates, so it does not offer the core alone at 48 kHz.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### A 96 or 192 kHz substream with no HSF extension substream

- **Where:** Part 1 4.2.4.3, p. 34 ("in case a substream is coded in 96/192 kHz, this additional substream holds
  the scale factor and spectral data beyond 24 kHz"); 4.3.6.2.1, p. 87 ("if a high sampling frequency extension
  is not present in the presentation, which is signalled by b_hsf_ext = 0, the transform length indicated in
  table 106 shall be used"); 5.4, p. 184.
- **Reading:** such a substream is refused (`DecodeError::kUnsupported`, "a 96 kHz or 192 kHz substream whose HSF
  extension substream could not be read"). Table 106 for b_hsf_ext = 0 suggests the substream is then coded at the
  base rate's block lengths, but Table 89 gives it the higher rate; the text does not say which holds, and
  either would be a decode of something the text does not define. The same holds for an extension linked from a
  substream with no `sf_multiplier`.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### The widths of max_sfb at 96 and 192 kHz

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.6.2.1, pp. 87 and 88: with `b_hsf_ext` the `n_msfb_bits` and `n_msfbl_bits` of the
  high sampling frequency's transform length come from Table 107 or 108, where Table 106 gives the base
  rate's.
- **Reading:** `max_sfb` and the LFE's are read at the width Table 106 gives the base length, which is the width
  Table 107 gives twice that length and Table 108 four times it, for every length of the three tables (held in
  `tests/ac4/decoder/test_hsf.cpp`). `n_side_bits` has no HSF column and is not used at these rates.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Scale factors and noise levels across an HSF extension

- **Where:** Part 1 Tables 41 and 42 (p. 47), 42b and 42c (pp. 48 and 49), Pseudocodes 21 to 23 (pp. 142 to
  145): each loops over the groups with `get_max_sfb(g)`, where the extension's own bands start at
  `num_sfb_48` and run to `get_max_sfb_hsf(g)` (Pseudocode 18, p. 138). The text gives no Pseudocode 21, 22 or 23
  for a track with an extension, and says only (5.1.3.1, 5.1.4.1) that `max_quant_idx` is derived from the
  extension's spectral data as well.
- **Reading:** the extension's bands are walked after every group's core bands, in the order the bitstream sends
  them, with the walk's state carried over: the scale factor of the first extension band with lines is the
  one before it plus its codeword's difference (the first of all, if the core had none, is
  `reference_scale_factor`, as Table 42b's `first_scf_found` implies); the noise level of an extension band is the
  level before it plus its codeword's step, the reference level (Pseudocode 22) the first band with energy of
  the core's and then the extension's; and the noise generator draws in the same order, a track's core and then
  its extension, track after track. Every band an extension's `dpcm_sf` and `dpcm_snf` are read for is walked
  in that order, so a differently ordered walk (each group's core and extension together) would not read its
  codewords in the order the extension substream holds them. With one window group the two orders are the
  same.
- **Evidence:** Text; `tests/ac4/decoder/test_noise_fill.cpp` holds the order, with one window group and two,
  to the clauses' steps over a list of bands in this order.

#### Stereo processing of the HSF extension's bands

- **Where:** Part 1 4.2.10 (Tables 47 and 48, pp. 51 and 52) and 5.3.2 (Pseudocode 59, p. 174): `chparam_info()`
  and `sap_data()` give parameters for the bands below `get_max_sfb(g)` alone, which at 48 kHz are the only bands
  with lines. Table 114, p. 95, gives `sap_mode` 2 as "M/S processing in all scale factor bands". At 96 and
  192 kHz the bands from `get_max_sfb(g)` to `get_max_sfb_hsf(g)` hold lines too, and no syntax carries
  parameters for them.
- **Reading:** the lines of those bands are processed with the parameters Pseudocode 59 gives a band it has
  none for, `a = d = 1`, `b = c = 0`, except in `sap_mode` 2 of a channel pair or of the matrices of three,
  four and five channels, which is M/S in every band by Table 114 and so in these (`a = b = c = 1`, `d = -1`),
  and the same for Table 183's two steps of a 7.X element. The matrices of Tables 178 and 179 and clause
  5.3.3.4 are applied to those lines with those parameters, as chel_matsel permutes tracks whatever the
  band. At 44.1 and 48 kHz the lines of these bands are zero and the choice is of no effect.
- **Evidence:** Text; no `sap_mode` 1 or 3 reading is needed, their bands being outside `ms_used` and
  `sap_coeff_used` either way. `tests/ac4/decoder/test_hsf.cpp` holds each of Tables 178 and 179's matrices,
  and the 7.X steps, to the tones put through the inverse of the printed matrices.

#### Frame alignment at 96 and 192 kHz

- **Where:** Part 1 5.6.2 and Table 188, p. 192: "a decoder shall apply a delay between the input and output PCM
  samples" of `d_pcm` samples by frame rate, so that the control data's delays are whole frames. Part 2 H.3
  says the decoded samples of tracks at different `sf_multiplier` in a switching set are to be time aligned
  by the encoder.
- **Reading:** `d_pcm` times the rate multiplier, the delay in seconds that Table 188 gives the base rate's
  frame. A stream at 96 or 192 kHz has no QMF domain, hence no 577-sample banks, no history of
  `ts_offset_hfgen` slots, and no control data to delay (`Decoder::latency_samples()` is `d_pcm` times the
  multiplier, and the converter's).
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed streams' tones come out at the decoder's delay so read.

#### The sample rate converter at 96 and 192 kHz

- **Where:** Part 1 6.2.15, p. 268, and Part 2 4.8.8: the converter uses Table 83's ratio at all three external
  rates, and Table 47 (Part 2, p. 110) lists the sample counts at 48 kHz alone.
- **Reading:** the converter of "The sample rate converter's filter and output grid", on the samples at the
  substream's rate, with the same ratio and the same phase locked to `sequence_counter`. Its filter is
  designed relative to the input rate, so the transition band is at the same fraction of the Nyquist
  frequency. The counts per frame follow from its grid: twice and four times Table 47's over the five phases
  at the 1000/1001 rates, and a constant count at the others.
- **Evidence:** Text; the frame counts at every ratio of Table 83 and the frequency each tone comes out
  at are held in `tests/ac4/decoder/test_hsf.cpp`.

#### The output stages at 96 and 192 kHz

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.8.1 (dialogue enhancement "operates in the QMF domain"), 5.7.9.1 ("DRC is operated in
  the QMF domain"), 5.7.9.3.3 (the output level gain as a factor on each QMF sample), 6.2.16 and 6.2.17 (mixing
  and rendering, equations on samples), 5.4 and 6.2.5.2 (no QMF domain).
- **Reading:** of what a stream at 96 or 192 kHz leaves of them: the output level gain applies, by
  2^((Lout - dialnorm) / 6) as a scalar on the samples, the last dialnorm the stream sent holding where it
  sends none, and the downmix applies, as the matrix of 6.2.17 on the samples. Dialogue enhancement where the
  stream sends parameters and the system asks for a gain, the compression curve and transmitted gains of
  DRC (which are per QMF band and slot), the mixing of a presentation's substreams, and the audio spectral
  frontend's alternatives (below) are refused with `DecodeError::kUnsupported` and a reason that names
  them, per frame; `DrcMode::kOff` leaves the output level gain alone, and a stream that sends no DRC
  configuration or no dialogue enhancement is unaffected by either.
- **Evidence:** Text; the gain and the downmix are held to the matrices and the gain in
  `tests/ac4/decoder/test_hsf.cpp`.

#### What a stream at 96 or 192 kHz may carry

- **Where:** Part 1 5.4's NOTE, p. 184 (no QMF domain tool), and Table 36a, which sends the extension for the
  audio spectral frontend's tracks alone.
- **Reading:** mono, 3.0, 5.X and 7.X channel elements and the channel pair in SIMPLE codec mode, with the
  ASF. The A-SPX and A-CPL codec modes, the speech spectral frontend, the immersive and 22.2 elements, and
  object audio are refused by name. Part 2 gives no decoding text for them at these rates.
- **Evidence:** Text.

### Output processing

What the QMF domain's matrices go through before synthesis, dialogue enhancement (Part 1 5.7.8), the
output level and DRC (5.7.9) and the downmix (6.2.17), and after it, the sample rate converter of Part 1
6.2.15, whose phase Part 2 5.11 locks to `sequence_counter`.

#### DRC's units

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.9.3.1.2, p. 256, converts the curve's gains "expressed in units of dB" by
  10^(G/20); 4.3.13.4.1, p. 127, gives the control points in dB2, which clause 3.4, p. 26, defines as 6 dB2
  to a factor of 2; 5.7.9.3.2 adjusts the transmitted gains "to reflect dB2 values"; 5.7.9.3.3's output level
  gain is 2^((Lout - Lin) / 6).
- **Reading:** dB2 throughout: a curve's gain G is 2^(G/6), as the transmitted gains and the output level
  gain are. The two conversions are 0.34 % apart, 0.08 dB at a 24 dB cut.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### The level DRC measures

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.9.3.1.1 and 5.7.9.3.1.2, pp. 256 and 257: the level L is the curve's argument, in
  dB relative to dialnorm, is smoothed as L~ = alpha L~ + (1 - alpha) L, and in adaptive smoothing enters
  10 x log10(L / L~), which takes it as a power; the method of measuring it is the implementation's.
- **Reading:** L is a power, the curve takes it in dB relative to dialnorm, and L~ smooths the power. The
  measurement is ITU-R BS.1770's: the K-weighted power of the channels, with BS.1770's channel weights (1
  at the front, 1.41 at the sides, 0 for the LFE), one wideband value per QMF time slot, the K-weighting
  read at each subband's centre and the analysis's energy gain (the sum of QWIN's squares) taken out, in
  LKFS. The gain comes from each slot's level and is then smoothed, as the text orders it.
- **Evidence:** Text; `tests/ac4/decoder/test_drc.cpp` measures each profile's static curve to 0.5 dB
  with stepped tones whose levels come from BS.1770's own calibration.

#### Choosing a DRC decoder mode

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.9.2, p. 255: by default the mode "with the largest mode ID value for which
  Lout,min < Lout < Lout,max"; Table 161, p. 123, gives the default modes' ranges as whole dB, -31 to -27,
  -26 to -17 and -16 to 0.
- **Reading:** the ranges include their edges, so that -31 selects home theatre, and an output level
  between two ranges is taken to its nearest whole dB. Portable speakers and portable headphones share a
  range; the system says which. A mode the stream does not configure, whether asked for by name or
  chosen, compresses nothing, and no mode applies below -31 or above 0 unless the stream adds one there.
- **Evidence:** Text; planning/ac4.md's decision 12 records the edges as inclusive.

#### The default profiles' smoothing

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 162, p. 124, gives each (E-)AC-3 profile but None its fast time constants and
  thresholds; Table 167's default smoothing, p. 129, turns adaptive smoothing off, and neither says
  whether a default profile smooths adaptively.
- **Reading:** a default profile smooths adaptively with its Table 162 values; a transmitted curve does
  as its `drc_adaptive_smoothing_flag` says.
- **Evidence:** Text. DEE sends its curves with the flag set and Table 162's values.

#### Transmitted DRC gains

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.9.3.2, p. 257, maps `drc_gain[chg][sf][band]` to the QMF samples of the band, the
  subframe and the group's channels.
- **Reading:** each gain holds across its band, subframe and channel group, with no smoothing between
  them, and multiplies the output level gain. A gains configuration of 0 is one gain for all channels.
- **Evidence:** Text; no stream DEE writes sends gains.

#### When dialogue enhancement's, DRC's and the downmix's values apply

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.2 and Table 188 hold the QMF domain's control data d_ctrl frames; 5.7.8, 5.7.9 and
  6.2.17 do not say when a frame's dialogue enhancement, dialnorm, DRC and mix gains reach the audio.
- **Reading:** with the rest of the frame's control data, so they apply to that frame's signal. Until the
  first frame's reach the QMF domain there is no dialnorm, and the output level gain is 1.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Where the downmix runs

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8, pp. 50 to 53, renders each substream (4.8.3.19) before loudness correction and
  the compression curves' DRC (4.8.6); Part 1 6.2.17 does not place the downmix in the QMF domain or after
  synthesis.
- **Reading:** in the QMF domain after DRC and before synthesis. A curve's gain is one gain for every
  channel at each QMF sample and a downmix is a fixed matrix, so the two commute, and the transmitted
  gains, which are per channel group, still come before it; only the channels that come out are
  synthesised.
- **Evidence:** Text; `tests/ac4/decoder/test_downmix.cpp` measures DEE's tones through each downmix.

#### The downmix gains

- **Where:** Part 1 Tables 149 and 149a, pp. 109 and 110, give each mix gain code both a linear value
  (0.707 for -3 dB) and a value in dB, which differ by up to 0.012 dB; Table 219, p. 271, and 6.2.17.6
  print 0.707 alone; 4.3.12.2.11 and 4.3.12.2.16 give the downmix loudness corrections in dB2.
- **Reading:** the mix gains and `lfe_mixgain` in dB, 10^(dB/20); Table 219's fold and the mono upmix at
  0.707 as printed; the loudness corrections in dB2, 2^(x/6). Without mix gains, -3 dB each, as Tables 149
  and 149a say; a surround code the table reserves reads the same.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### The listener's Lt/Rt and the stream's Pro Logic II form

- **Where:** Part 1 6.2.17.4, p. 271: the matrix follows the user-selected downmix method or, with none
  selected, `preferred_dmx_method`, whose codes 2 and 3 are both Lt/Rt (Table 150) and give Table 218 two
  Lt/Rt rows.
- **Reading:** a listener who asks for Lt/Rt gets the Pro Logic II row where the stream prefers code 3,
  and the plain Lt/Rt row otherwise; one who asks for stereo without naming a method gets the stream's
  preference, Lo/Ro where it prefers none (code 0). The Lo/Ro correction goes with Lo/Ro and the Lt/Rt
  correction with both Lt/Rt rows.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### The LFE in a downmix

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.12.2.18, p. 111, NOTE: after start-up or a splice "a value of -inf dB may be used
  for lfe_mg until an AC-4 frame with b_lfe_mixinfo = 1 is received"; Table 218 mixes the LFE at lfe_mg.
- **Reading:** the LFE stays out of a downmix until the stream sends `lfe_mixgain`, and then goes in at
  it; a stream that never sends it leaves the LFE out. The system may keep it out regardless
  (`OutputConfig::mix_lfe`).
- **Evidence:** Text; DEE's 5.1 streams send `b_lfe_mixinfo` 0.

#### Dialogue enhancement's front channels

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.8.2, p. 248, takes the processed channels from "de_channel_config{x}", "the bit at
  position x", without saying which end position 0 is; Table 171, p. 132, names the codes' channels, and
  5.7.8.6's example, p. 252, puts L, the unprocessed second channel and C in rows 0, 1 and 2.
- **Reading:** the three front channels are L, R and C in that order, bit 2 of `de_channel_config` being
  L, bit 1 R and bit 0 C, as Table 171 names them; the parameter sets go to the processed channels in
  that order.
- **Evidence:** Text; DEE's speech streams set 110 and send parameters for L and R.

#### The subbands above dialogue enhancement's bands

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.8.4 and Table 173, pp. 251 and 133, segment "the num_qmf_subbands QMF subbands"
  into eight bands, and the last ends at subband 40.
- **Reading:** subbands 41 to 63 have no parameters and pass through dialogue enhancement unchanged.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Dialogue enhancement without its waveform

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.8.9, p. 253, splits the enhancement of the hybrid methods between the parameters
  and a coded dialogue waveform, by alpha_c; 5.7.8.1 lets a low-complexity decoder "use only the
  parametric data to perform dialogue enhancement".
- **Reading:** where the presentation has no dialogue enhancement substream, or one with fewer channels
  than the method takes, a hybrid method enhances by its parameters alone, as its parametric counterpart
  does, at the whole gain; where it has one, the waveform takes its share ("The hybrid dialogue
  enhancement's waveform", under Presentations).
- **Evidence:** Text; the main substream of `presentations-hybrid.ac4` decoded alone measures the whole
  gain on its parameters.

#### The dialogue enhancement gain the system asks for

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.8.7, p. 253, caps the system's G_DE at G_max; the text does not bound it below.
- **Reading:** G_DE runs from 0 to the stream's G_max: at 0 or below the tool leaves the signal as it is,
  and above G_max it applies G_max. An I-frame whose `b_de_data_present` is 0 leaves no parameters, and
  the tool does nothing until parameters come.
- **Evidence:** Text; planning/ac4.md's control table gives G_DE as 0 dB up to the stream's cap.

#### The sample rate converter's filter and output grid

- **Where:** Part 1 6.2.15, p. 268, asks only that the converter "should use high-quality anti-aliasing
  filters"; Part 2 5.11 and Table 47, p. 110, give the number of samples each frame yields at the
  1000/1001 rates, by phase.
- **Reading:** a Kaiser-windowed sinc, polyphase, with the passband to 0.86 of the lower rate's Nyquist
  frequency and the stopband from that frequency 100 dB down (`src/ac4/src/core/dsp/resampler.hpp`). Output
  sample m is complete once (m + 1) x down / up input samples have arrived, so frame t of N samples
  yields floor((t + 1) R) - floor(t R), R = N x up / down: Table 47's sequence for phi_t = t modulo 5, and
  a constant count at the other rates. A converter starting at phi_t starts its grid t frames in.
- **Evidence:** Text, and Table 47 held in `tests/ac4/core/test_resampler.cpp`. DEE's IMS streams
  at 23.976, 24, 25 and 29.97 fps lag their sources by a constant per rate, within 1.3 samples of DEE's half
  frame plus this decoder's delay (`tools/checks/score_ac4_decode.py`, LAG_AT_RATE).

#### The converter's phase across a splice

- **Where:** Part 2 5.11, p. 110: phi_t goes on from phi_t-1 where `sequence_counter` is 0 and the frame is
  not the first, and a change of source that moves the sequence "shall only be applied at the time the
  first frame of the new source is returned".
- **Reading:** a change of source keeps phi_t and the converter ("A change of source"). The frame a
  splicer marks 0 takes phi_t-1 + 1, so its sample count goes on in the old sequence; the frame after it
  takes its own counter's phase. Where that jumps, the converter's grid moves by the jump and keeps the
  input it holds, so the jump neither drops samples nor inserts silence. The count changes with the
  frame that brings the new source's first samples out, whose first samples are still the old source's:
  the grid moves at that frame's start, which shifts the old source's last samples by less than one
  output sample.
- **Evidence:** Text; `tests/ac4/decoder/test_decoder.cpp` holds the counts across a jump and a 0 at
  29.97 fps.

#### The profile a transcoder to AC-3 or E-AC-3 takes

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.9.4, p. 258; 4.3.13.2.2 and Table 160, p. 123.
- **Text:** the clause has a transcoder apply no DRC and configure the AC-3 or E-AC-3 encoder with the
  curve of a field it calls `drc_eac3_transcode_curve`, "in table 160". Part 1 has no field of that
  name; Table 160 is `drc_eac3_profile`'s, which 4.3.13.2.2 describes as the (E-)AC-3 profile to use
  when transcoding.
- **Reading:** the field is `drc_eac3_profile`, the one of the presentation transcoded. `forge
  transcode` (`apps/cli/commands/stream_tools.cpp`) decodes that presentation with no output level, and
  so no DRC, and the AC-3 or E-AC-3 encoder computes its `dynrng` with the profile the field names: 1 to
  5 the five of Table 162, and 0 ("None") and the reserved 6 and 7 none, the re-encode then writing no
  `dynrng`. The clause names one curve, so it shapes the line mode's gains; the RF mode's `compr` stays
  the encoder's own option (`heavy`).
- **Evidence:** Text. The value reaches the transcoder as the decoder reports it
  (`DrcInfo::eac3_profile`), not through the syntax the two transcriptions read, so neither has a
  reading to take; `tests/cli/test_cli_ac4.cpp` transcodes streams whose profile is film light and one
  that sends no DRC.

### Presentations

Which presentation the decoder decodes (Part 2 4.8.2), and how it mixes a presentation's substreams (Part
1 6.2.16; Part 2 4.8.3.15 to 4.8.5): phase D7. The decoder's transcription is
`src/ac4/src/decoder/presentations.cpp`, `src/ac4/src/decoder/pcm/mixer.cpp` and the mixing in
`src/ac4/src/decoder/decoder.cpp`; the Python one, written from the text separately, is
`tools/references/ac4_presentations.py` for the selection and `tools/checks/mix_ac4_decode.py` for the
mixes. The streams that reach these readings are built for them: the selection table
(`tests/golden/ac4/presentations/presentation-selection.tsv`) and the test multiplexer's streams beside
it, whose substreams carry a tone each (`tests/ac4/decoder/test_presentations.cpp`).

#### Which presentations can be selected

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8.2, pp. 39 and 40; 6.3.2.2.3 and Table 55, p. 157; 6.3.2.3.1, p. 158; Part 1
  4.3.3.3.8 and Table 86, p. 76.
- **Text:** a decoder of compatibility level n "shall not decode (i.e. select) presentations with md_compat
  > n"; a disabled presentation "shall not be selected"; a decoder decodes presentation versions 1 and 2,
  and version 0 is Part 1's; Table 55 reserves md_compat 4 to 6 and calls 7 "Unrestricted".
- **Reading:** a presentation can be selected when its presentation_version is 0, 1 or 2, its md_compat is
  one its table defines (Table 55: 0 to 3 and 7; Table 86: 0 to 4 and 7) and no more than the decoder's
  level, the stream has not disabled it, it carries audio (a single substream or group, or
  presentation_config 0 to 5), and the decoder decodes all of it: every substream channel-coded, in a
  channel mode it renders, at 48 or 44.1 kHz, and none a fragment of the efficient high frame rate mode that
  was not assembled (a presentation of another fraction than the selected one's).
  md_compat 7 is above every level Table 55 defines, so it is selected only by a decoder told its level
  is 7. The default level is 3.
- **Evidence:** Text; the selection table's cases, which both transcriptions take.

#### The order of the preferences

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8.2, p. 40: the selection "is application dependent", resting "mainly" on "language
  type, availability of associated audio, and type of audio (multichannel for speaker rendering, or a
  pre-virtualized rendition for headphones)"; the decoder "should not rely on the order and number of
  presentations, as both can change over time". Part 1 4.3.3.8.8's NOTE, p. 80: a presentation's language
  is that of its main or dialogue substream, never its associated audio's.
- **Reading:** the presentation the system names by `presentation_id`, else by its position, else the one
  that best meets the preferences in the order the clause lists them. Language first: the presentation's
  is its first dialogue substream's tag, else its first main or music and effects substream's; a tag
  equal to the one asked for (ignoring case) ranks above one whose primary subtag alone matches. Then
  associated audio: where the system asks for a service (a Table 91 classifier, and optionally Table
  92's refinement), a presentation carrying it; where it asks for none, a presentation carrying none. A
  presentation carries the service of its associated substream, or of its main substream where that is
  classified as associated audio (Part 2 Table 54) or carries a Table 92 code. Then the kind:
  `b_pre_virtualized` as the system's headphones ask. Among equals, the first in the table of contents.
  The choice is made again at each frame, so a presentation named by `presentation_id` is followed
  wherever it moves.
- **Evidence:** Text; the selection table (30 cases, versions 0 and 1) holds both transcriptions.

#### The mixer's sum

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8.4, p. 51: "The actual mixing is done for each channel ch by summing up that channel
  Xs,ch of each substream s", with the equation Y_ch = (sum over s of X_s,ch) / n_sub; Part 1 6.2.16.1 and
  6.2.16.2, p. 269, add the dialogue and the associated audio to the main audio with no division.
- **Reading:** the sum, as the prose and Part 1 have it. Dividing by n_sub would put the music and effects
  of a presentation with dialogue 6 dB under the same substream decoded alone, and make every level
  depend on the number of substreams.
- **Evidence:** Text; every mix of the multiplexed streams measures each substream at its formula's
  gain (`mix_ac4_decode.py` now checks 114 mixes). When this entry was written, a decoder that
  divided failed five of the presentations test's eleven cases and 62 of the script's 68 mixes.

#### Substream group gains

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.2.3, p. 124: `ac4_presentation_substream()` reads `sg_gain` for sg below
  n_substream_groups, only where n_substream_groups is above 1; 6.3.3.1.22 to 6.3.3.1.24, p. 170, with
  `b_keep` repeating the previous frame's gains, 0 dB until the first sent; 4.8.4, p. 51, applies g_sg
  to "each substream s which is part of a substream group sg". Configuration 1 has n_substream_groups 1
  and configuration 4 has 2 for three groups ("presentation_config 1 and 4 read more specifiers than
  n_substream_groups", above).
- **Reading:** the gains go to the groups in the order the presentation's `ac4_sgi_specifier()`s name
  them. Configuration 1 sends none. Configuration 4 sends the main group's and the associated group's;
  the dialogue enhancement group has none of its own, and its waveform, which joins the main substream's
  channels (5.7.8.9), takes the main group's. A frame whose `b_substream_group_gains_present` is 0
  applies 0 dB; `b_keep` repeats the last gains sent for that many groups, or 0 dB where none were.
  Version 0 presentations have no group gains.
- **Evidence:** Text; the multiplexed streams' gains (-2 dB in configuration 0, -1 dB in 3 and 4, -0.5
  and -1.5 dB in 5) measure to 0.01 dB in both transcriptions.

#### Where the substreams are mixed

- **Where:** Part 2 Figure 4, p. 39, and 4.8.3 to 4.8.7: each substream is decoded and rendered to the
  output layout, the substreams are mixed, and loudness correction, DRC and QMF synthesis follow; Part 1
  6.2.16.0, p. 268: the mixer's output has the main or music and effects substream's channels, and "no
  additional channels are allowed for the dialogue or associated audio substream, except for a mono
  channel". Part 2 4.8.6, p. 53, and Part 1 6.2.13, p. 268: DRC's side chain is the signal before
  dialogue enhancement.
- **Reading:** in the QMF domain, each substream after its own dialogue enhancement, before the output
  level, DRC, the downmix and one QMF synthesis for the output. A substream's channel that the main or
  music and effects substream does not have goes nowhere, which only a stream the text forbids has. DRC's
  side chain is the mix of the substreams' signals before their dialogue enhancement, with the same
  gains. A presentation needs all of its substreams: a frame in which one is refused or missing fails
  whole and is concealed, rather than coming out without it. The decoder mixes up to eight substreams
  into the main one, in fixed storage: a presentation within Table 55's track counts (11 at md_compat
  3, the main substream's channels among them) has no more, and the rest of a larger one, which only
  md_compat 7 allows, are left out.
- **Evidence:** Text; against each substream decoded alone, the formula leaves the output 110 dB under it
  or more.

#### The main audio's and the dialogue's scaling with associated audio

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8.3.17, pp. 49 and 50; Part 1 6.2.16.2, p. 269, and 4.3.12.4.4 to 4.3.12.4.8,
  p. 119, which print `scale_main` and `scale_main_front` as "a negative gain of 0 dB (0x00) to 76,2 dB"
  with 0xff "a full mute", and `scale_main_centre` as "a gain of 0 dB (0x00) to -76,2 dB" with 0xff
  "-∞ dB". Part 1 6.2.16.0, p. 268: the mixing metadata "remain valid until new ones are transmitted in
  the same stream or until a splice is detected".
- **Reading:** each is -0.3 dB a step, 255 silence, 0 dB where none has been sent. C takes
  `scale_main_centre` and `scale_main`, L and R `scale_main_front` and `scale_main`, every other channel
  `scale_main`. They apply only in a presentation with associated audio, to the main or music and
  effects substream and to each dialogue substream, whose own channels take them before it is panned:
  a mono dialogue, whose channel is C, takes `scale_main_centre` wherever its pan puts it. They come from
  the presentation substream in version 1 and from the associated substream's `extended_metadata()` in
  version 0, and hold until sent again; a change of source forgets them.
- **Evidence:** Text; the multiplexed streams' -6, -1.5 and -3 dB measure to 0.01 dB, in versions 1 and 0,
  in both transcriptions.

#### The dialogue's gain and pans

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.12.4.11, p. 119, prints g_dialog_max's formula wholly as a subscript,
  "g_dialog max=(1+dialog_max_gain)×3[dB]", and sets it to 0 dB where an I-frame does not send it; Part 2
  4.8.3.18, p. 50, sets it "to 0 otherwise" where `b_dialog_max_gain` is false; Part 1 6.2.16.1, pp. 268
  and 269: one `pan_dialog` per track for mono and stereo dialogue, and for more tracks two, which
  `pan_signal_selector`'s simplified decoding of a 3.0 substream takes (4.3.12.4.14, p. 120); "Tracks
  that do not have a pan value are not to played back".
- **Reading:** g_dialog_max is (1 + `dialog_max_gain`) x 3 dB. It holds from the frame that sends it
  until a frame of the substream that is an I-frame does not, which sets 0 dB; Part 2's "otherwise" is
  read as Part 1's I-frame rule. The listener's g_dialog, capped at g_dialog_max, applies to every
  channel of every dialogue substream. A mono or stereo dialogue substream with `pan_dialog` takes one
  pan a channel; without it, a mono one takes 0 degrees, as `pan_associated`'s default, and a stereo one
  goes channel to channel. This decoder does not do the simplified 3.0 decoding, so a 3.0 dialogue
  substream's channels go channel to channel, and "not to be played back" is read of the simplified
  decoding's third track.
- **Evidence:** Text; g_dialog at -6 and +9 dB against caps of 3, 6 and 12 dB, and pans to 330, 0 and 30
  degrees, measure to 0.01 dB in both transcriptions.

#### Panning

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.12.4.9, p. 119: angles from the front, clockwise, "standard Right speaker is at
  +30 degree", with codes 0xf0 to 0xff not to be used; Table 216, p. 269, gives the gains at three angles
  only: 330 degrees L, 0 degrees C (a 5.1 output) or 0.5 to each of L and R (a 2.0 one), and 30 degrees
  R. Table D.1, p. 301, lists "approximate speaker positions" whose azimuths turn the other way and put
  L and R at 45 degrees, the surrounds at 110 (5.X) or 90 (7.X).
- **Reading:** L, C and R sit where the pan clause puts them, at 330, 0 and 30 degrees; the other
  channels at Table D.1's azimuths turned clockwise: Ls and Rs at 250 and 110 degrees in the 5.X modes
  and 270 and 90 in the 7.X ones, Lb and Rb at 225 and 135, Lw and Rw at 300 and 60. The LFE and the top
  channels are outside the ring a pan moves round. A signal at an angle goes to the two channels either
  side of it, shared linearly, the two gains summing to 1, which is what Table 216's 0.5 and 0.5 at 0
  degrees between L and R needs. A code the text reserves is taken modulo 360 degrees.
- **Evidence:** Text; the audio description at 330, 0 and 30 degrees into 5.1, and at 0 degrees into 2.0,
  measures to 0.01 dB in both transcriptions, and a constant-power law fails them.

#### The associated audio's gain

- **Where:** Part 1 6.2.16.2, p. 269: g_assoc in [-∞, 0] dB applies "to all associated audio channels",
  while the formula for a substream that is not mono, "Y_mixi = X_mainadj + X_associatedi", has none;
  Part 2 4.8.3.17, p. 49, applies it to each channel; Part 1 4.3.3.8.8 and Table 92, p. 80: with a premix
  code the associated audio "was mixed with the Main audio content prior to encoding", and user gains
  "should be disabled".
- **Reading:** g_assoc, capped at 0 dB, applies to every channel of the associated substream, mono or
  not, except where its language tag is a premix code (qax, qtx, qsx, qex). An associated substream that
  is not mono goes channel to channel.
- **Evidence:** Text; g_assoc at -10 dB on a mono and on a stereo associated substream measures to
  0.01 dB in both transcriptions.

#### Levelling before the mix

- **Where:** Part 1 6.2.16.0, p. 268: substreams "need to be at the same reference level", by
  10^((Lout - dialnorm)/20) unless DRC processing (5.7.9.3.3) has done it, and this levelling "shall not
  be done if both the presentation_version is 0 and the dialnorm values of the music and effects and
  dialogue substreams differ"; Part 2 4.8.5.2 and Table 16, pp. 51 and 52: in version 0 the dialnorm
  comes from "the basic_metadata of the associated substream for presentations containing associated
  audio; and the substream indicated in table 16 for main audio decoding", Table 16 naming a substream
  for configurations 2 to 4 as well, which contain associated audio; 4.8.6, p. 53, takes DRC from the
  substream that gives the dialnorm. In version 1 the presentation substream carries the one dialnorm.
- **Reading:** a version 0 presentation's dialnorm, which its output level and DRC take, is Table 16's
  substream's: the dialogue's in configurations 0 and 3, the main one's otherwise. The music and effects
  and the dialogue are not levelled against each other. The associated audio, whose own dialnorm is the
  first bullet's, comes to the presentation's before the mix, by 2^((dialnorm - own) / 6): dB2, as the
  output level gain of 5.7.9.3.3 is ("DRC's units"), so that at any output level it plays as it does
  decoded alone. Without an output level it comes to the presentation's dialnorm all the same, as if
  that were Lout. A version 1 presentation levels nothing.
- **Evidence:** Text; `presentations-v0.ac4` levels its audio description by -4.01, +2.01 and +3.01 dB and,
  at an output level of -31 dBFS, puts its music and effects 6.02 dB under their own level behind
  dialogue at -25 dBFS, in both transcriptions; a levelling in dB fails the first by 0.014 dB.

#### The hybrid dialogue enhancement's waveform

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.8.9, pp. 253 and 254: the hybrid methods add "up to three waveforms", Y = (I +
  g_p diag(p)) m + g_s d_c for the channel independent method, (I + g_p r p, r g_s) (m, d_c) for the
  cross-channel one, and with the M/S flag 1/2 g_s (1, 1) d_c beside the Mid's processing; the
  conditions on g_s and g_p print "g < Gmax" for G, the cross-channel matrix r p for r p^T, and the M/S
  equation drops the sign between its terms. Part 2 Table 53, p. 156: configurations 1 and 4 carry the
  waveforms in a dialogue enhancement substream; the text does not say which of its channels goes where.
- **Reading:** the dialogue enhancement substream's channels, in its own order, are d_c: one for each
  processed channel, in L, R, C order ("Dialogue enhancement's front channels"), with the channel
  independent method; one, the Mid's, halved into L and R with the M/S flag; one, rendered by r, with the
  cross-channel method. A presentation without that substream, or whose substream has fewer channels
  than its method takes, enhances by the parameters alone at the whole gain, as 5.7.8.1 lets a
  low-complexity decoder do. The waveform joins the main substream's channels before its gains, so it
  takes the main group's gain and the scaling of associated audio.
- **Evidence:** Text; the three methods measure to 0.01 dB against the main and the waveform decoded
  alone, in both transcriptions.

### The channel renderer

The readings phase D9 takes to render the immersive element by Part 2's channel renderer (5.10.2), which
takes its place in the downmix stage: Tables 38 to 43 in full decoding and 45 and 46 in core decoding,
with the custom downmix parameters (6.2.9.2, 6.3.10.3) and the loudness corrections (4.8.5.3). The
decoder takes them in `src/ac4/src/decoder/pcm/renderer.cpp` and `downmix.cpp`, and
`tools/checks/gain_ac4_decode.py` takes them again in the matrices it holds DEE's 5.1.4 legs to.

#### The renderer's input channel configuration

- **Where:** Part 2 5.10.2.2 and 5.10.2.4, pp. 102 and 103: the input channel configuration is the one
  `pres_ch_mode` or `ch_mode` indicates, and the element's modes are 7.X.4 (and 9.X.4); Tables 38 to 43 give
  rows for 7.X.2, 5.X.4 and 5.X.2 inputs, which no channel mode names. 6.3.2.7.1, p. 159, says the three
  presence flags signal "whether some of the channels as signalled by channel_mode are actually present in
  the original content", and 6.2.9.2 derives `bs_ch_config`, which custom downmix data depend on, from
  them.
- **Reading:** the input configuration is the channel mode narrowed by the presence flags: 7.X with
  `b_4_back_channels_present`, 5.X without; .4 with `top_channels_present` 3, .2 with 1 or 2, .0 with 0.
  The channels it leaves out are silenced, as 5.10.2.2 says of input signals the input channel mode lacks,
  and decode()'s as-coded output is that configuration. Core decoding's Tables 45 and 46 read the flags
  themselves. `b_centre_present` 0 leaves C in, silent.
- **Evidence:** Text. DEE's 5.1.4 legs send `b_4_back_channels_present` 0 and come out as 5.1.4.

#### Where a .2 source's top pair is carried

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 59, p. 161: with `top_channels_present` 1, "Original content of Tsl, Tsr is
  carried in Tfl, Tfr"; with 2, "carried in Tbr, Tbl".
- **Reading:** Tsl in Tbl and Tsr in Tbr, left in left as with 1: the printed order lists the pair and
  does not pair it crosswise.
- **Evidence:** Text. No stream here sends `top_channels_present` 1 or 2 but the constructed ones.

#### Custom downmix data

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.9.2, p. 151: every presentation substream sends `custom_dmx_data()`, with or
  without data (`b_cdmx_data_present`); 6.3.10.3.10, p. 208: a parameter "not transmitted for a certain
  out_ch_config" takes Table 130's default, except that "For the downmix from bs_ch_config = 1 to
  out_ch_config = 4 the same tool_t4_to_t2() parameters as for the downmix to out_ch_config = 1 shall be
  used, if transmitted". Nothing says how long data a frame sends hold.
- **Reading:** the data a frame sends hold until a frame sends others, as the mix gains and the loudness
  corrections do (Part 1 6.2.17.0, Part 2 4.8.5.3), and each sending replaces them whole: a parameter it
  does not send for an `out_ch_config`, or an `out_ch_config` it does not send, takes Table 130's default.
  The exception holds where `out_ch_config` 4 sends no `gain_t1_code` and `out_ch_config` 1 does. The
  gains are in dB, 10^(dB/20), code 7 silence.
- **Why:** DEE sends custom downmix data in I-frames alone, 12 of a leg's 237 frames; the defaults between
  them would move the render's gains at every I-frame.
- **Evidence:** Streams: G1's 23 5.1.4 height legs (`out_ch_config` 0, `gain_t2a_code` to
  `gain_t2e_code` from 0 dB to silence) render to 5.1 and to two channels at the gains they send, in
  every frame, in full and core decoding (`tools/checks/gain_ac4_decode.py --gold ... --g1`).

#### The loudness correction of a render

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8.5.3, p. 52: "When downmixing is done in the decoder, the loudness shall be adjusted
  using the output channel-specific loudness correction factor from the loud_corr element that relates to
  the selected downmix"; `loud_corr()` (6.2.9.1) sends one per output configuration, and the core's.
- **Reading:** a render takes its output configuration's correction (`loud_corr_7_X`, `_7_X_2`,
  `_5_X_4`, `_5_X_2`, `_5_X`) where it downmixes, its output narrower or lower than the input
  configuration, and none where it does not: as coded, or to a configuration as wide and as high or more.
  Core decoding takes `loud_corr_core_5_X_2` and `loud_corr_core_5_X` on the same terms against the source's
  configuration. A correction of 31 is 0 dB.
- **Evidence:** Text. DEE's legs send no correction for an immersive output (`b_corr_for_immersive_out`
  0).

#### The renderer's two-channel output

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 34, p. 104, and Table 44, p. 107, render to 5.X.0 at the narrowest; Part 1
  6.2.17 downmixes 5.X to two channels by Table 218; `loud_corr()` sends `loro_dmx_loud_corr` and
  `ltrt_dmx_loud_corr`, and the core's `loud_corr_core_loro` and `_ltrt`.
- **Reading:** to two channels, or one, the renderer goes to 5.X.0 (Table 43, or 46 in core decoding),
  and Part 1's step 2 follows with the stream's stereo coefficients and the Lo/Ro or Lt/Rt correction
  alone, the core's in core decoding: the correction that "relates to the selected downmix" is the stereo
  one, and `loud_corr_5_X` would count the fold to 5.X.0 twice.
- **Evidence:** Text; DEE's legs in both modes (`tests/ac4/decoder/test_pcm.cpp`).

#### Core decoding's layouts

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 44, p. 107: core decoding renders to 5.X.2 and 5.X.0 alone.
- **Reading:** a layout asked for with top channels comes out as 5.X.2, one without as 5.X.0; as coded,
  5.X.2, or 5.X.0 where the source has no top channels.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### DRC's groups in core decoding

- **Where:** Part 2 4.8.3.16, p. 49: "For core decoding mode the decoder should discard gain values which
  are assigned to channels that are not present in the core channel configuration"; Table 69, p. 170,
  groups 7.X.4's channels and has no group for Tsl and Tsr.
- **Reading:** Tsl and Tsr take group 4's gains, those of the tops they carry; the gains of Lb, Rb and the
  four tops go with channels the core does not have, and Ls and Rs keep group 3's.
- **Evidence:** Text.

### A-JOC

The readings phase D10 takes to decode A-JOC substreams (Part 2 clause 5.7) in full and core decoding,
with A-JOC's dialogue enhancement (5.8.2.3 and 5.8.2.4). They are the decoder's alone: the Python
transcription reads the syntax. `src/ac4/src/core/ajoc/` does the processing, and
`tests/ac4/core/test_ajoc.cpp` holds it to the formulas on known input. The constructed streams of
`tests/ac4/decoder/objects.cpp` give each object coefficients of whole quantisation steps, so that each
object is a known sum of the downmix's tones, which the decoder meets to 0.1 dB in both modes. Chromium's
`ac4-ajoc.ac4` decodes in both with the invariants holding. librempeg, the one other decoder here, refuses
every object substream ("object coding is not implemented"), so no reading below rests on it.

#### A-JOC's ramp

- **Where:** Part 2 Pseudocodes 17 and 18, pp. 88 to 90: `ajoc_interpolate()` moves a coefficient while
  `curr_ramp_len <= target_ramp_len` and increments `curr_ramp_len` itself, and Pseudocode 18 calls it
  for every coefficient of every subband of a slot; at the end of a slot where a data point starts, the
  counter is set to 0 and the target to that data point's `ajoc_ramp_len`.
- **Reading:** one counter a substream, advanced once a slot for all its coefficients. A coefficient
  moves by its `delta_inc` in a slot that starts with the counter below the target, so a ramp of
  `ajoc_ramp_len` slots moves that many times, from the slot after its start slot, and ends on its
  target; the start slot sets `delta_inc` to (the data point's value - the value it put out) /
  `ajoc_ramp_len`. The counter, the target and every coefficient's value and `delta_inc` carry from frame
  to frame, all 0 before the first, so a ramp of up to 64 slots (5.7.3.4) runs on across frames.
- **Why:** advanced by every call, the counter would pass its target within the first slot and no ramp
  would last more than one; compared with `<=`, a ramp would move `ajoc_ramp_len` + 1 times and pass its
  target by a step.
- **Evidence:** Text. The kernel's tests check ramps of one and two data points within a frame and
  across frames; the constructed streams ramp over 1 and 8 slots.

#### The decorrelation input matrix

- **Where:** Pseudocode 18, p. 89, sums `abs(mtx_wet_dq[o][dp][de][pb]) * mtx_dry_dq[o][dp][ch][pb]` into
  `mtx_pre_param[pb][de][ch][dp]` over each object's own `ajoc_num_bands[o]` bands, and interpolates it
  at `sb_to_pb(sb)` without saying whose band count maps the subband; 5.7.3.6.2, p. 91, writes D(ts, sb)
  = |Csub2(ts, sb)^T| x Csub1(ts, sb), from the interpolated matrices.
- **Reading:** subband by subband: in each QMF subband, each object's coefficients at the band its own
  count maps the subband to (Table 28), summed over the objects, per data point and before dialogue
  enhancement scales them, as Pseudocode 18 takes them. The sum is a parameter with its own
  interpolation, as Pseudocode 18 makes it, so during a ramp D is not the product of the ramped dry and
  wet matrices that 5.7.3.6.2 writes; the two agree once the ramp ends.
- **Why:** band indices of different counts cover different subbands, so a sum over band indices has no
  one mapping back to subbands; where every object has the same count, the readings agree.
- **Evidence:** Text; the kernel's tests check the matrix of objects of different band counts against a
  hand computation, and the wet path against the decorrelators and duckers run by hand.

#### Pseudocode 16's sparse wet entries

- **Where:** Pseudocode 16, p. 83: for a wet entry `ajoc_sparse_mask_wet[o][de]` leaves out,
  `mtx_wet_q[o][dp][ch][pb] = (nquant - 1) / 2`, indexed by `ch` in the loop over `de`.
- **Reading:** `mtx_wet_q[o][dp][de][pb]`, the loop's own index, at the range's centre, which
  dequantises to 0.
- **Evidence:** Text; `ajoc-5lfe-aspx-decorr-sparse` leaves wet entries out.

#### A-JOC's differential decoding across frames

- **Where:** Pseudocode 16 and 5.7.3.2, pp. 82 and 83: DIFF_TIME adds to `mtx_dry_q_prev` and
  `mtx_wet_q_prev`, "the quantized values from the last corresponding data point of the previous AC-4
  frame", which the pseudocode sets after each data point, and does not take the sum modulo `nquant` as
  DIFF_FREQ does; nothing gives the previous values where the object was not present, where its
  `ajoc_quant_select` or `ajoc_num_bands` changed, or before any frame.
- **Reading:** the previous values are the last data point's, of this frame or of the last frame that
  sent the object. An object not present stands at the range's centre (5.7.3.3 sets an inactive object's
  coefficients to 0), in whichever quantisation it next comes in. A DIFF_TIME sum outside 0 to `nquant` -
  1 fails the substream as invalid; a DIFF_TIME entry with no previous values fails as missing its
  I-frame where no frame has sent the object, and as invalid where its quantisation or band count changed.
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed streams send DIFF_TIME in the frames between I-frames, with an
  object not present.

#### A disabled decorrelator

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.6.2.1, p. 175: `ajoc_decorr_enable[d]` "indicates whether the decorrelator with
  index d is enabled"; nothing says what a disabled one puts out.
- **Reading:** silence, so the wet coefficients on it add nothing. Its history and its ducker's go, and
  it starts from silence when next enabled, as does one past `ajoc_num_decorr`.
- **Evidence:** Text; Chromium's stream uses no decorrelator.

#### A static downmix's inputs

- **Where:** 5.7.2.1, p. 80: QinAJOC is the `var_channel_element()`'s output reordered by Pseudocode 14a;
  with `b_static_dmx` (6.2.3.4) the downmix is a 5.X channel element instead, and nothing orders its
  channels as A-JOC's inputs.
- **Reading:** L, R, C, Ls and Rs, Table A.27's order, with the LFE apart as Pseudocode 14a leaves it; in
  core decoding those five are the objects, bed objects at their speakers after the LFE.
- **Evidence:** Text; `ajoc-static-5_1` decodes to each object's coefficients' tones in that order.

#### Core decoding's objects

- **Where:** 4.8.3.4.2, p. 44: "The decoder shall use the first portion present in the bitstream for core
  decoding mode"; the downmix portion's `oamd_dyndata_single(n_dmx_signals, ...)` lists objects, and
  nothing pairs them with the downmix's signals.
- **Reading:** the downmix portion's objects are the downmix signals in QinAJOC's order, the LFE first,
  as "The objects of an A-JOC substream" pairs the upmix's objects with the reconstruction's outputs.
- **Evidence:** Text; Chromium's stream decodes in core decoding to its ten downmix signals, each with the
  first portion's metadata.

#### Core decoding's H_M

- **Where:** 5.8.2.4, pp. 96 and 97: the downmix plus H_M(ts, sb) H_A(ts, sb) times the downmix, H_A the
  dialogue objects' rows of `mtx_dry` after `ajoc_de_process()` with core decoding's `de_gain`, 10^(G_DE /
  20) - 1, and H_M ramped from H'_M,prev to H'_M by (ts + 1) / `num_qmf_timeslots`, H'_M[sb][ch][dlg] =
  `de_dlg_dmx_coeff[dlg][ch]`; Pseudocode 22 scales the coefficients only where `de_gain` is above 1. "Gmax
  shall be derived from de_max_gain", with no formula in Part 2.
- **Reading:** Pseudocode 22's test belongs to full decoding's `de_gain`: in core decoding the dialogue
  objects' dry coefficients take core's `de_gain` whenever dialogue enhancement is asked for (G_DE above 0
  dB), and the downmix is left as it is otherwise. H'_M and H'_M,prev are kept by upmix object, 0 for one
  that carries no dialogue, so that a change in which objects carry dialogue ramps each from its own last
  coefficient; H'_M,prev is 0 before the first frame. The dry matrix is interpolated for every object in
  every frame that asks for dialogue enhancement, so it is in step when an object turns to dialogue.
  Gmax is Part 1 4.3.14.3.2's, (`de_max_gain` + 1) x 3 dB.
- **Why:** core's `de_gain` passes 1 only above 6.02 dB; with the test, a G_DE below that would leave H_A
  unscaled and add the dialogue again, 6 dB up whatever G_DE was asked.
- **Evidence:** Text. `tests/ac4/decoder/test_objects.cpp` holds a constructed dialogue case to the
  formulas in both modes, at 6 dB and at 12 dB, which the stream's `de_max_gain` of 2 caps at 9.

### Object audio metadata and the ISF renderer

The readings phase D10 takes for what the object audio metadata sets and when (Part 2 clauses 5.9 and
6.3.9, Annex F), and for the intermediate spatial format renderer (5.10.3). They are the decoder's alone.
`tests/ac4/decoder/test_objects.cpp` holds the constructed streams' positions and timing to the
formulas of 6.3.9.8.4 and 5.9.2, and their intermediate spatial format to Annex A.2.1's matrices.

#### Object audio metadata

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.9.6 to 6.3.9.8 and 6.3.9.12, pp. 188 to 204, and Annex F: what an
  `object_info_block()` sets; NOTE 1 of 6.3.9.8.4.2 to 6.3.9.8.4.4: a difference refers to "the standard
  precision position value coded in the previous metadata update block"; Table 101's `object_gain_code`
  0b11, "Set to object_gain of previous object".
- **Reading:**
  - A block starts from the object's last block's properties; REUSE keeps them. An inactive object takes
    Table 98's and Table 99's DEFAULT: gain -infinity dB, priority 0, X and Y 0.5 and Z 0, no zone,
    elevation off, width and screen factor 0, no snap.
  - A difference adds to the last standard precision position the object's blocks coded, explicitly or as
    a difference, clipped to 0 to 62 and -15 to 15; a block that sends no position leaves it. Extended
    precision refines the position of the block that sends it alone.
  - `object_gain_code` 0b11 takes the gain of the object before it in the same substream's list, in the
    same block; the first object takes 0 dB.
  - The other properties' group sets each property it does not send to its default: no width, screen
    factor 0, the depth exponent 1 (Table 107's code 2), no distance and divergence 0. A reserved
    divergence code (Table 111's 0) and `object_div_mode` 0b11 keep the last divergence, as 0b01 does.
  - `add_per_object_md()` sets its block alone: a block without it has trim on and no headphone data.
  - An alternative presentation's alternative properties (6.3.9.4) are read and not applied: its
    objects carry their blocks' properties.
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed streams send differences, reuses, extended precision and each of
  the other properties.

#### When an update takes effect

- **Where:** 5.9.2, p. 98: an update's sample is `sample_offset` + 32 x `block_offset_factor`, "an
  offset to the first PCM sample of the actual codec frame", and "One block update is valid until the
  update PCM sample of the next received block update"; Annex F.11's ramp.
- **Reading:** the update's sample in the decoder's output, where the codec frame's first sample comes
  out the decoder's delay later (1,313 samples at `frame_rate_index` 13), so that the metadata stays with
  the essence it describes; an update past the frame's end waits for the frame that holds its sample. The
  ramp goes with the update, to the renderer.
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed streams' updates come out at their samples plus 1,313.

#### DRC and object audio

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.9 and Part 2 4.8.6 apply DRC "to the channels", and 4.8.3.19 hands the object
  renderer each object's essence with its properties.
- **Reading:** objects take the output level's gain, 2^((Lout - dialnorm) / 6), and no compression, which
  belongs to the channels an application renders them into. A presentation's `b_obj_loud_corr` values
  are read and not applied.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### Dialogue enhancement of direct-coded objects

- **Where:** 5.8.2.5, p. 97: in a dialogue substream, the gain 10^(min(G_DE, Gmax) / 20) goes to "the
  corresponding audio objects for which b_dialog is true", Gmax 3 x (1 + `dialog_max_gain`) dB, and 0 dB
  without `b_dialog_max_gain`.
- **Reading:** every object of a direct-coded substream whose `extended_metadata()` sets `b_dialog`, the
  LFE among them; `dialog_max_gain` holds from the frame that sends it until an I-frame that does not, as
  a dialogue substream's does for the mix (Part 1 4.3.12.4.11). Pseudocode 22's test does not apply: the
  clause gives none.
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed direct-coded streams, made dialogue substreams, come out 6 dB up
  asked for 6, and at their cap of 9 asked for 12.

#### The intermediate spatial format

- **Where:** 5.10.3.4, p. 110: y = M x t, t the ISF objects in Table 61's order and M Annex A.2.1's
  matrix for the output channel configuration; the attachment declares each `SR<config>_to_<layout>` as
  `[NUM_ISF_CHAN][NUM_SPKR_CHAN]`, a row per object; Tables A.25 and A.26, p. 213, name the 5.x, 7.x and
  9.x matrices `SR<config>_to_50`, `_to_70` and `_to_90`, which the attachment calls `_to_5`, `_to_7` and
  `_to_9`; nothing gives the order of a matrix's speakers; 4.8.3.19 hands the tool each object "plus its
  decoded associated object properties".
- **Reading:** each speaker is the sum over the objects of each one times its row's value at the
  speaker's column; `_to_5`, `_to_7` and `_to_9` are the tables' `_to_50`, `_to_70` and `_to_90`. A
  matrix's columns are its layout's speakers in Table A.27's order without the LFE, as the values show:
  SR3.1.0.0's M1, the front, reaches L and R alike, and M2, on the left, the left speakers more than the
  right. Each object's gain applies before the matrix, -infinity
  for an inactive one, ramped over its update's ramp. The output layout is 7.X.4 as coded and the
  downmix target's otherwise: a two-channel target takes the 2.x matrix, and mono that matrix's L + R.
  The 9.X layouts' screen pair (Table A.27's 24 and 25) is no speaker the decoder names, so it renders
  none of them. In a presentation with channels, the format is rendered into the channels' layout, and
  refused where Annex A.2.1 has no matrix for it.
- **Evidence:** Text; the constructed `direct-isf-sr3100` renders each object's tone to each speaker at
  its coefficient in all eight layouts, and 5 dB up where its metadata sets that gain.

#### A presentation name in chunks

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.3.1.2 to 6.3.3.1.4, p. 167: an alternative presentation's substream may send
  `presentation_name`, name_len bytes of UTF-8, 32 without `b_length`. "If byte[name_len-1] = 0, the name
  of the presentation is given by byte[0] to byte[name_len-2]; otherwise, the name of the presentation is
  serialized into multiple chunks, each transmitted in one codec frame. If byte[name_len-2] = 0, the
  currently received chunk is the last chunk", and its byte[name_len-1] is "the total number of chunks";
  the decoder stores the chunks "until the total number of chunks is received".
- **Text leaves open:** which bytes of a chunk before the last are the name's; whether the chunks come in
  consecutive frames; where a decoder that joins in the middle begins; what fills a 32-byte field longer
  than the name.
- **Reading:** a chunk before the last carries name_len bytes of the name, the last name_len - 2. The name
  is the chunks of consecutive frames of the presentation substream up to and including the last, taken
  only when there are as many as its count says, so a decoder that joins in the middle waits for the next
  repetition; a frame of the substream that sends no name, a count that does not match and a change of
  source each discard the chunks gathered. A name ends at its first zero byte, so a 32-byte field padded
  with zeros gives the name before them. The last name received stays until another replaces it or the
  source changes.
- **Evidence:** Text; no stream here names a presentation. The 14 cases of
  `tests/golden/ac4/presentations/presentation-names.tsv` hold the decoder, through hand-built frames
  (`tests/ac4/decoder/test_api.cpp`), and the Python reference (`tools/references/ac4_presentations.py`,
  `tools/checks/test_ac4_presentation_names.py`) to the same names.

### Tables

The Huffman codebooks come from the table attachment of Part 1, `ts_103190_tables.c`, which Annex A
names as normative, with the parameters Annex A prints; every one of the 60 is a complete prefix code
(its Kraft sum is exactly 1). Annex B's scale factor band tables come from the text, each checked against
a rendering of its page. `tools/generators/gen_ac4_tables.py` and
`tools/generators/gen_ac4_reference_tables.py` generate the C++ and Python tables separately. Part 2's
A-JOC and A-JCC codebooks (its Annex A.1.1 and A.1.2, 24 in all) come from the arrays of its attachment,
`ts_103190_tables_part2.c`, the same way, so that all 84 codebooks are complete prefix codes.

Phase D10's tables: A-JOC's Table 28 and its dequantisation (Tables 29 to 32, uniform steps about each
range's centre, every row checked), Tables 78 and 82, and the object audio metadata's tables that give
values (Tables 98, 99, 101 to 105, 107, 108, 110, 111 and 121 to 125) come from the text, each checked
against a rendering of its page; the common data's (Tables 112 to 120) are handed on as the stream codes
them. The intermediate spatial format's matrices come from Part 2's attachment,
`ts_103190_tables_part2.c`, through `gen_ac4_tables.py`, which checks each matrix's size against the
attachment's `#define`s and that all 60 matrices of Tables A.25 and A.26 are there.

### The trace

Decisions about what a record holds, which both transcriptions share (the full contract is in
`docs/verification.md`):

- Elements read into temporaries record the bits sent: `tmp_num_env`, and `aspx_rel_bord_left`,
  `aspx_rel_bord_right` and `aspx_tsg_ptr` for Table 53's anonymous `tmp`.
- `aspx_int_class` is one record whose value is the code read (0, 2, 6 or 7).
- A field whose width the stream sets and whose bits the syntax does not interpret (`add_data`,
  `extensions_bits`, `drc2_bits`) is one record valued at its last 64 bits, split into 65535-bit records
  when longer; `variable_bits()` records its value modulo 2^64, and splits the same way when its groups
  run past 65535 bits, each record then valued at its own last 64 bits. A record's width is 16 bits, so
  an element wider than that has no single record to sit in.
- An element that runs past the end of its substream is not recorded.

### The differential check

No stream of DEE's reaches most of the syntax: noise fill, VARVAR framing, time-interleaved A-SPX, the
mono, 3.0 and 7.X elements, ASPX_ACPL_1 and A-CPL in a channel pair, transmitted DRC gains, dialogue
enhancement methods 1 to 3 and alternative presentations among it. The constructed streams under
`tests/golden/ac4/constructed/` reach the 3.0 and 7.X elements and every A-CPL mode, and both
transcriptions read them alike. To compare the two transcriptions on the rest, both read streams made for
the purpose: DEE frames with one substream altered (a random tail from a random bit, a few flipped bits,
or a random codec mode), and tables of contents built for the channel modes no encoder here writes, over
random payloads, a quarter of them for a group of A-JOC and direct-coded object substreams, and a third
of the single-instance Part 1 modes at 96 or 192 kHz with an HSF extension substream; the constructed
streams under `tests/golden/ac4-hsf/` are among those mutated. Wherever
both read a substream to its end their traces must agree record for record, and where either stops they must agree up to that point. The two transcriptions still stop at different
elements on some corrupt input, since each checks some values at a different point, which the check
reports separately. The script is `tools/checks/ac4_syntax_differential.py`, which the nightly
SonarCloud workflow runs; it does not gate a merge.

## The encoder

The readings this encoder takes where ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1 (Part 1) and ETSI TS 103 190-2 V1.3.1
(Part 2) leave a writer's choice open. Where the decoder depends on the same reading, the
decoder's section above has the entry and this one points at it; the writer and both readers take it.

The evidence for a reading is one of:

- **Readers**: what the encoder writes is read back as written. The decoder's reader and the encoder's own
  trace agree record for record on every stream the tests and the fuzz target `fuzz_ac4_encode` write. The
  encoder-space harness (`tools/ci/fuzz_ac4_encoder_space.py`) holds them and the Python parser
  (`tools/references/ac4_syntax.py`) to one trace on every stream it writes, and FFmpeg's raw AC-4 and mov
  demuxers frame them.
- **Streams**: DEE's streams, or a reader outside this project, settle it.
- **Text**: the text alone.

Later phases add the readings their tools need.

### Shared with the decoder

The writer takes the decoder's reading of each of these:

- [audio_size covers the fill](#audio_size-covers-the-fill): a frame's bits beyond
  its audio are `fill_bits` inside `audio_size`, before `metadata()`.
- [byte_align is relative to the substream](#byte_align-is-relative-to-the-substream).
- [ext_code is at most 21 bits](#ext_code-is-at-most-21-bits): the quantiser clips a
  line at 8191, and a band whose peak would pass it takes a coarser step.
- [Scale factors outside 0 to 255](#scale-factors-outside-0-to-255): every scale
  factor the deltas reach stays in range.
- [Pseudocode 59's stray block](#pseudocode-59s-stray-block): the M/S matrix and the
  prediction, with `0.1f` a float, and an `alpha_q` sent against a pair of bands `sap_data()` sent no
  coefficient for counted from 0.
- [Full scale, and the overlap-add's factor of two](#full-scale-and-the-overlap-adds-factor-of-two),
  [KBD_RIGHT's argument](#kbd_rights-argument) and
  [The KBD kernel is summed to p = N](#the-kbd-kernel-is-summed-to-p--n): the forward
  transform is the transpose of the decoder's, through the same windows, with lines scaled by 2^16 so
  that a full-scale input decodes at full scale.
- [Partial coupling starts at acpl_param_band](#partial-coupling-starts-at-acpl_param_band):
  the A-CPL writer (`src/ac4/src/encoder/acpl/acpl_syntax.hpp`, phase D5's, for the constructed streams and
  for E4) sends each parameter set from `acpl_param_band`, its first value along frequency from the F0
  codebook, as Table 65 reads it.
- The immersive element (phase D9's, for the constructed 7.X.4 streams): the frame writer's 7.X.4 channel
  modes with their presence flags, and the A-JCC writer (`src/ac4/src/encoder/ajcc/ajcc_syntax.hpp`), take
  [The framing of the immersive element's chparam_info()](#the-framing-of-the-immersive-elements-chparam_info)
  and [immersive_codec_mode_code in the trace](#immersive_codec_mode_code-in-the-trace);
  `custom_dmx_data()` sends custom downmix data for the height downmix alone ("The height downmix", below)
  and `loud_corr()` no correction for the immersive outputs.
- The channel renderer (phase D9's): the frame writer's `top_channels_present` takes
  [Where a .2 source's top pair is carried](#where-a-2-sources-top-pair-is-carried), and
  a writer that sends custom downmix data in I-frames alone, as DEE does, relies on
  [Custom downmix data](#custom-downmix-data) to hold them between.
- Object audio (phase D10's, for the constructed object streams of `tests/ac4/decoder/objects.cpp`):
  the A-JOC writer (`src/ac4/src/encoder/ajoc/ajoc_syntax.hpp`), the object audio metadata writer
  (`src/ac4/src/encoder/oamd/oamd_syntax.hpp`) and the table of contents' object groups take
  [Arrays read as one field](#arrays-read-as-one-field),
  [Prefix codes in the trace](#prefix-codes-in-the-trace),
  [add_per_object_md()'s parameters](#add_per_object_mds-parameters),
  [n_objects_code and the LFE](#n_objects_code-and-the-lfe),
  [The objects of a direct-coded substream](#the-objects-of-a-direct-coded-substream),
  [Which oamd_timing_data() applies](#which-oamd_timing_data-applies) and
  [var_channel_element()'s A-SPX and companding](#var_channel_elements-a-spx-and-companding).
  Each budget the syntax gives a nested element (`add_data_bytes`, `add_table_data_size_minus1`, the
  `skip_bits` of `ajoc_bed_info()` and `ext_prec_alt_pos()`) is the fewest bytes that hold what is sent,
  measured as the decoder measures it; where bits of an `add_data` budget are left after `trim()`, the
  decoder reads `bed_render_info()` and then `headphone()` from them, so the writer sends those two, absent
  where nothing is given for them, before the padding.

### The QMF domain

The readings phase E2 takes for the ASPX codec mode: companding and A-SPX, written. The writer takes the
decoder's reading of each of these, and the tests and the encoder-space harness hold the three traces
equal on every ASPX stream they write:

- [Every codec mode passes through the QMF banks](#every-codec-mode-passes-through-the-qmf-banks):
  an ASPX stream lags its input by the SIMPLE mode's delay, 4,385 samples at `frame_rate_index` 13.
- [Companding measures against full scale 1.0](#companding-measures-against-full-scale-10),
  [Companding's slots are Q_low's](#compandings-slots-are-q_lows) and
  [The companding average](#the-companding-average): the compressor below inverts the
  expander those readings give; the writer sends `b_compand_on` per channel and never `sync_flag`.
- [The estimated envelope's time divisor](#the-estimated-envelopes-time-divisor): a
  signal envelope is the input's mean energy per QMF subsample over its groups and slots.
- [The first signal scale factor below zero](#the-first-signal-scale-factor-below-zero):
  an envelope coded along frequency whose first value is below the F0 codebooks' floor sends 0 there, and
  the second group's value takes it over.
- [The sinusoid's subband](#the-sinusoids-subband), [b_sine_at_end](#b_sine_at_end)
  and [Before the first interval](#before-the-first-interval): what the encoder keeps
  of the decoder's state to choose delta coding and sinusoids.
- [Pre-flattening's direction](#pre-flattenings-direction): the encoder runs the
  decoder's high frequency generator on its input's low band to choose inverse filtering, noise floors and
  sinusoids, and flattens the patch as the decoder does. Phase D4 changed the reading.

#### Where the encoder's QMF slots fall

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 188's `d_pcm` and `d_ctrl`, 5.7.3's analysis, and 5.7.6.3.2's
  `ts_offset_hfgen`, read from the writer's side: which input samples a frame's A-SPX data describes.
- **Reading:** the decoder's QMF slot g covers the 64 samples of the encoder's delayed input from
  `64 g - d_pcm`, since the output of the inverse transform is held `d_pcm` samples before the
  analysis; frame f's control data arrives `d_ctrl` frames later, behind `ts_offset_hfgen` slots, so its
  interval's slot i is QMF slot `num_qmf_timeslots (f + d_ctrl) - ts_offset_hfgen + i`: at
  `frame_rate_index` 13, 352 samples, 1 frame and 6 slots, `32 (f + 1) - 6 + i`. The encoder analyses
  its input with the decoder's own bank on that axis and estimates each frame's envelopes, noise floors
  and inverse filtering over those slots, and dialogue enhancement's and DRC's values over the same
  block, where the decoder's output stages meet them.
- **Evidence:** Streams and Readers. The encoder's ASPX streams decode at the lag of DEE's, and above
  the crossover the decoded A-SPX tiles land as close to the source's energy as DEE's do
  (`tools/checks/score_ac4_encode.py --gold`).

#### The compressor

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.5 gives the expander only: each slot of the low band times `2^(1/alpha)
  L^((1 - alpha)/alpha)`, `alpha` 0.65, with L the slot's level.
- **Reading:** the compressor multiplies each slot of the input's low band, below `sbx`, by `0.5
  L^(alpha - 1)`, L measured as the expander measures it on the input's own analysis: expanded, the
  slot's level is L again. The compressed slots, with nothing above `sbx`, are synthesised back by the
  decoder's synthesis bank, whose output runs `d_pcm` + 577 samples (929 at `frame_rate_index` 13)
  behind the analysis's input; the spectral frontend codes that output as far on, so that the decoder's
  analysis of what it decodes sees the compressed slots on the same axis.
- **Evidence:** Observation. A 1 kHz tone whose level steps by 30 dB steps by 0.65 of that, 19.5 dB,
  compressed (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_aspx.cpp`), and the encoder's companded streams decode within
  0.4 dB of their source's level.

#### A sinusoid's group carries its energy

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 92 to 94, pp. 222 and 223: a group with `aspx_add_harmonic` set puts its
  sinusoid in its middle subband, at the level `scf_sig / (1 + scf_noise)` of the whole group, and scales
  the rest of the group to the noise.
- **Reading:** the encoder sends, for a group whose sinusoid an envelope carries, the energy per QMF
  subsample of the subband it stands for, not the group's mean, which would set the sinusoid a group's
  width low.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### A noise floor for a group whose patch holds nothing

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 94 and 95, pp. 223 and 224: a subband's noise level is `sqrt(scf_sig / (1 +
  scf_noise) * scf_noise)` whatever its patch holds, and its patch gain `sqrt(scf_sig / ((EPSILON + est_sig) *
  (1 + scf_noise)))`, with `EPSILON` 1.0, a QMF sample at full scale being 2^15.
- **Reading:** a patch of energy `est` per QMF subsample delivers `est / (1 + est)` of the share `1 / (1 + Q)`
  the envelope gives it (`Q` being `scf_noise`), so a group whose patch holds nothing is silent unless its noise
  `Q / (1 + Q)` or a sinusoid takes the energy. That is a sweep's group while the tone is above the crossover, the
  low band having nothing to copy. The encoder measures, per noise group and interval, the share of the input's
  energy that its patch delivers (the decoder's generator run on the input's low band at the modes chosen, a
  subband with a sinusoid or coded by the spectral frontend counting as delivered whole), and where it is under
  three quarters sends the noise floor at which `(share + Q) / (1 + Q)` reaches three quarters, if that is louder
  than the floor its tonality rule chose: `qscf_noise` 4, `Q` 4, for an empty patch. A group whose input is below
  the smallest signal envelope, 64 per QMF subsample, is silence and keeps its floor.
- **Evidence:** Streams and Observation. DEE's streams send a floor in every group: `qscf_noise` 7 to 17 on
  a 5.1.4 sweep, 7 in nine values of ten on music, where this encoder sent 29, the least, in 95 to 99 % of
  the sweep's values and 80 to 96 % of the music's. DEE's decoded tone lands 15 to 17 dB under the source's
  energy above 16.5 kHz; this encoder's landed 32 to 61 dB under it in 5.1 and 48 to 61 in 5.1.4, and lands 3
  to 4 dB under it with the floors (`tools/checks/score_ac4_encode.py --gold`, G1's sweeps). The sweep test in
  `tests/ac4/encoder/test_encoder.cpp` holds it.

#### Balance values are sent halved

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 80 and 81 add each value of a balance channel twice (`delta` 2), and
  Pseudocode 84 reads the pair as a sum, `2^(qa/a + 1)` times 64, and a ratio, `2^(qb/a - PAN_OFFSET)`,
  with `PAN_OFFSET` 12. The balance F0 codebooks hold 0 to 24 at 1.5 dB and 0 to 12 at 3 dB.
- **Reading:** the sum's value is `a (log2(2^(qL/a) + 2^(qR/a)) - 1)`, and the value sent for the balance
  is half of `a (PAN_OFFSET + (qL - qR)/a)`, so that the F0 range is centred on equal channels; the noise
  floors likewise, without `a`. A balance channel's values are coded along time only from the last
  frame's balance values, which the doubling leaves even.
- **Evidence:** Readers. The encoder writes `aspx_balance` only when asked (`experimental=aspx-balance`),
  since no reader outside this project has read it from the encoder yet.

#### A FIX end, a FIX start

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 76 starts a VARFIX or VARVAR interval where the last one stopped, which a
  FIXVAR or VARVAR interval's `aspx_var_bord_right` moves up to three A-SPX slots past its frame's end,
  and starts a FIXFIX or FIXVAR interval at the frame's start whatever the last did.
- **Reading:** an interval that ends with its frame is followed by one that starts with its frame, and
  one that runs on by one that starts where it stopped, so that the intervals tile the QMF slots.
- **Evidence:** Text.

#### No time deltas into an I-frame

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.10.3: `aspx_sig_delta_dir` and `aspx_noise_delta_dir` code an envelope along time
  from the one before, which for an interval's first envelope is the last frame's.
- **Reading:** an I-frame's first signal and noise envelopes are coded along frequency, so that a decoder
  can start there; later envelopes may be coded along time.
- **Evidence:** Text.

### Table of contents and framing

#### sequence_counter

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.2.2 counts `sequence_counter` from 1 to 1020 and round again; Part 1 Annex
  E.1 asks for 0 in the first frame of a file.
- **Reading:** 0 in the stream's first frame, then 1 to 1020 and round again from 1.
- **Evidence:** Readers.

#### The CRC of a sync frame

- **Where:** Part 1 Annex G.4.2, p. 316, gives the generator polynomial and initial state of `crc_word`, and
  G.3.1, p. 315, places it after the raw frame; Part 2 Annex C points at that annex.
- **Reading:** the CRC-16 of polynomial 0x8005, from 0, over `frame_size` (two bytes, or five with the
  24-bit extension) and the raw frame.
- **Evidence:** Streams. The inspector's check of this coverage passes on every frame of DEE's 0xAC41
  streams, and the encoder-space harness computes it again from the text.

#### Leftover bytes go in payload_base

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.2.10 and 4.3.3.2.11: `payload_base` places the first substream that many
  bytes after the table of contents.
- **Reading:** at a constant rate a frame's size is fixed, and a table of contents whose size moves with
  the substream sizes it carries can leave one to seven bytes over; `payload_base_minus1` takes them, as
  zero bytes between the table of contents and the presentation substream.
- **Evidence:** Readers.

#### An MP4 track's channel count

- **Where:** Part 2 E.4, Table E.3, p. 223: `channelcount` of the `ac-4` sample entry "shall be ignored" on
  decoding and, on encoding, "should be set to the total number of audio output channels of the first
  presentation of that track".
- **Reading:** 2, for mono and for a multichannel first presentation as for stereo. The `dac4` says what
  the stream holds and a reader ignores this field, so the writer departs from the text's "should" for
  every presentation of other than two channels.
- **Evidence:** Text, for the two rules; nothing reads the value. FFmpeg's mov demuxer reads the track.

### The 5.X and 7.X elements

The readings phase E3 takes for 5.0 and 5.1, and for 7.0 and 7.1 as an experimental option. The writer
takes the decoder's reading of each of these, and the tests and the encoder-space harness hold the three
traces equal on every 5.X and 7.X stream they write:

- [The LFE's track is not numbered in Tables 180 and 182](#the-lfes-track-is-not-numbered-in-tables-180-and-182):
  the LFE's `mono_data(1)` first, the channel data's tracks counted after it, and in the 7.X element C's
  `mono_data(0)` after the additional pair where `coding_config` 0 and 2 send it.
- [The 7.X element's additional channels](#the-7x-elements-additional-channels): the
  encoder sends `b_use_sap_add_ch` 0, so its additional pair is its own two channels and the reading's
  matrix is not written.
- Table 213's name for 3/2/2's last pair (the misprints in `src/ac4/ERRATA.md`): Tfl and Tfr, as
  Tables 88 and 183 have them.

### A-CPL

The readings phase E4 takes for ASPX_ACPL_2 and ASPX_ACPL_3 in the 5.X element, and for ASPX_ACPL_1
there and A-CPL in the channel pair as experimental options. The writer takes the decoder's reading of
each of these:

- [When A-CPL's parameters apply](#when-a-cpls-parameters-apply): a frame's
  parameters are estimated from the QMF slots of the A-SPX interval they share a control frame with,
  over a window centred on the last of them, where smooth interpolation reaches the new values.
- [ASPX_ACPL_1: the framing of the residuals](#aspx_acpl_1-the-framing-of-the-residuals):
  the 5.X element's residuals share A and B's framing and layout group, and `max_sfb_master`, in
  n_side_bits of the largest transform length, stops them at `acpl_qmf_band`.
- [get_max_sfb() with b_dual_maxsfb](#get_max_sfb-with-b_dual_maxsfb): the channel
  pair's ASPX_ACPL_1 sends one `sf_info()` with `b_dual_maxsfb`, the side stopped at `acpl_qmf_band` by
  its own `max_sfb_side`, and `chparam_info()` at `sap_mode` 0.

#### The downmixes A-CPL codes

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 115 to 118, pp. 238 to 241, give the upmix; nothing gives the downmix a
  writer codes, or its level.
- **Reading:** the signals the upmix keeps whatever its parameters: the channel pair's x0 = (L + R) / 2,
  whose z0 + z1 is 2 x0; ASPX_ACPL_1's and 2's (L + Ls / sqrt 2) / 2 and its mirror, whose z0 + z1 /
  sqrt 2 is 2 x0 once Pseudocode 117 has scaled z1 by sqrt 2; and ASPX_ACPL_3's Lo and Ro, L + C /
  sqrt 2 + Ls / sqrt 2 and its mirror, over 1 + sqrt 2, which Pseudocode 118's input gain, 1 + 2
  sqrt 0.5, brings back to Lo and Ro. ASPX_ACPL_1's residuals are (L - Ls / sqrt 2) / 2 and its
  mirror, or the pair's (L - R) / 2: below `acpl_qmf_band` Pseudocode 116 takes x0 plus and minus the
  residual, which gives each pair back as it was.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's ASPX_ACPL_2 and ASPX_ACPL_3 streams decode with these downmixes, recovered
  from the output, 21 to 25 dB over the noise below the crossover on music (phase D5).

#### ASPX_ACPL_3's gammas

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 118 and 119, pp. 241 and 242: six gammas mix Lo and Ro into the three
  decorrelators' inputs, the two modules' groups and C. The text says what they do, not how a writer
  chooses them, and more than one choice rebuilds the same channels.
- **Reading:** gamma5 and gamma6 are the least squares prediction of C / sqrt 2 from Lo and Ro, per
  parameter band, and gamma1 = 1 - gamma5, gamma2 = -gamma6, gamma3 = -gamma5 and gamma4 = 1 - gamma6,
  counted in the quantiser's steps (ten fine steps or five coarse ones make 1), so that each module's
  group is Lo or Ro less the predicted centre, L + Ls / sqrt 2 or its mirror where the prediction is
  exact. beta3 gives the centre the energy the prediction leaves out.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's 5.1 streams at 96 kbps hold the four relations in 3,534 and 3,539 of the
  3,555 bands of music and film, and one relation is a step out in the rest.

### The immersive element

The readings phase E8 takes for 5.0.4 and 5.1.4 in SCPL, ASPX_SCPL and ASPX_ACPL_2, and for ASPX_ACPL_1,
ASPX_AJCC and 7.0.4 and 7.1.4 with the back pair as experimental options. The writer takes the decoder's
reading of each of these, and the tests hold the three traces equal on every immersive stream they write:

- [Table 19's track numbers are labels](#table-19s-track-numbers-are-labels) and
  [Which channel holds which intermediate signal](#which-channel-holds-which-intermediate-signal):
  `core_5ch_grouping` 0 with `2ch_mode` 0, as DEE writes it, and A'' to K'' coded where the channels they
  become are.
- [The framing of the immersive element's chparam_info()](#the-framing-of-the-immersive-elements-chparam_info)
  and [Table 20's prediction gains](#table-20s-prediction-gains): each coupled pair's
  difference is predicted from its sum band by band with Pseudocode 59's gain, and a pair and the pair
  predicted from it share a transform layout.
- [The core's top pair is Tsl and Tsr](#the-cores-top-pair-is-tsl-and-tsr): the
  encoder's streams decode in core decoding to 5.X.2, each top pair's two channels in its side of it.

#### Table 20's prediction

- **Where:** Part 2 5.2.3.2 step 5, p. 60, and 5.3, p. 63: S-CPL makes each coupled pair of its sum and
  difference; nothing says how a writer forms them, or what the four `chparam_info()` should send.
- **Reading:** each coupled pair's channels over sqrt 2 are coded as their sum and difference (M/S in every
  band), and the difference as its least-squares prediction's residual from the sum (`sap_mode` 3) where
  that costs fewer bits than the difference itself, else `sap_mode` 0. A 5.1.4 source's absent back pair
  makes each surround pair's difference its sum, which the prediction takes whole at a gain of 1.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's SCPL and ASPX_SCPL streams send `sap_mode` 3 there in nearly every frame
  (the decoder's entry). Readers: every channel's tone decodes on its own channel, and the decoder's trace
  is the encoder's.

#### immersive_audio_indicator and the presence flags

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.2.3 and 6.3.2.7: `b_additional_data` and `add_data()` may carry
  `immersive_audio_indicator`; the presence flags describe the source's channels. Nothing says when a
  writer sets either.
- **Reading:** an immersive presentation sends one byte of additional data, `immersive_audio_indicator` 1
  and no advanced dialogue enhancement data, as DEE's 5.1.4 streams do; the presence flags are the
  source's: `b_4_back_channels_present` only with the back pair, the centre, both top pairs.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's 5.1.4 streams carry both so.

#### The height downmix

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.9.2 to 6.2.9.10: `custom_dmx_data()` sends per output
  configuration where the top channels go and at what gain; DEE's `height_dmx_mode` names three routes.
- **Reading:** `HeightDownmix::kFront` sends both top pairs to L and R, `kSurround` both to Ls and Rs, and
  `kFrontAndSurround` the top front pair to L and R and the top back pair to Ls and Rs, each at the one
  gain (Table 129), for `out_ch_config` 0 (5.X.0), in I-frames alone, as DEE's streams carry its three
  modes; 7.0.4 and 7.1.4 add the back pair's `gain_b_code`.
- **Evidence:** Streams: G0's and G1's height downmix legs; the decoder renders the encoder's streams to
  each route at its gain (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_immersive.cpp`, `tools/checks/gain_ac4_decode.py`).

#### A-JCC's parameters

- **Where:** Part 2 5.6, pp. 68 to 78, gives A-JCC's upmix; nothing gives the core a writer codes or how it
  chooses the parameters. DEE's 5.1.4 streams never use ASPX_AJCC.
- **Reading:** `ajcc_core_mode` 0. The core is each side's front, L + Tfl / sqrt 2, and back, (Ls + Lb +
  Tbl) / sqrt 2, over Pseudocode 8's input gain 2 + 1 / sqrt 2, and C over the same, so that the upmix
  keeps each column's sum. Per A-CPL parameter band, the front module's alpha and beta are estimated as the
  A-CPL modules' are; the back module's dry values are the least-squares shares of the column's sum, and
  its wet values those whose decorrelated signals give what the quantised shares leave its covariance.
- **Evidence:** Readers: one tone per channel decodes on its own channel in full decoding, and in core
  decoding at Pseudocode 14's gains (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_immersive.cpp`).

### Objects

The writer takes the decoder's readings of [A-JOC](#a-joc) and of [object audio
metadata and the ISF renderer](#object-audio-metadata-and-the-isf-renderer) by
running the decoder's own reconstruction (`src/ac4/src/core`'s `ajoc::Reconstruction`) on the parameters it
weighs: the ramp's counter, the decorrelation input matrix by subband, H'_M by object. Objects take the
output level's gain and no DRC, so an object presentation refuses DRC gains.

#### A-JOC's downmix

- **Where:** Part 2 p. 161: the standard does not specify the downmix; 5.7 gives the upmix alone, and
  4.8.3.4.2 a computed downmix's signals their own metadata for core decoding.
- **Reading:** a computed downmix sums the objects in groups: the full-band objects in the order of their
  azimuth about the room's centre as they start, from the back left through the front to the back right,
  cut into as many runs as there are downmix signals, as equal as can be. The groups stay for the stream,
  so that each A-JOC coefficient keeps its meaning from frame to frame. Each signal's metadata is one block
  a frame at the energy-weighted centre of its group over the frame, ramped over the frame. A static 5.X
  bed pans each object between the front row (L, C, R) and the back row (Ls, Rs) by the sine and cosine of
  a quarter turn of Y, and along each row the same way by X; Z is left out, and the LFE object goes to the
  LFE. The pans move linearly across each 32 samples from the object's positions at their ends. A-JOC's
  input i reads the element's full-band track that Pseudocode 14a gives it, so the encoder puts downmix
  signal i there.
- **Evidence:** Readers: each object of a computed downmix, a static 5.1 bed and one with bed objects
  decodes at 40 to 74 dB SNR against the object given, and core decoding gives each downmix signal at its
  group's centre (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_objects.cpp`). Chromium's `ac4-ajoc.ac4` has a computed downmix
  of ten signals.

#### A-JOC's parameters

- **Where:** Part 2 5.7.3, pp. 83 to 91, gives the reconstruction; nothing gives how a writer chooses the
  matrices.
- **Reading:** one data point a frame at its first slot, over the frame's A-SPX interval as A-CPL's
  parameters are. The candidates are the last frame's values again; the least-squares fit of each object
  from the downmix per parameter band over the frame, as a ramp of 32 slots from the last frame's matrix
  takes it there, and as a step at the second slot; and the fit over the 32 slots centred on the frame's
  end. Each is quantised within Tables 29 to 32's ranges, its smallest coefficients dropped in turn where
  it takes more than 30 per cent of the frame, run through the reconstruction from the state the frames
  sent leave it in, and the one whose objects come closest to the objects given is sent. With
  decorrelators, object o takes decorrelator o mod `ajoc_num_decorr`, whose wet coefficient gives it the
  energy the dry matrix leaves out. Each set goes along frequency, or along time where that takes fewer
  bits outside I-frames, each object sparse where that takes fewer, and not present where every value is
  0. `ajoc_dmx_de_data()` names no dialogue objects.
- **Evidence:** Readers (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_objects.cpp`).

#### When an object's metadata changes

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.9.3 and 5.9.2: a block's update takes effect at `sample_offset` + 32
  `block_offset_factor` into its codec frame, counted with the decoder's delay.
- **Reading:** an update at input sample n is at sample n + the encoder's delay of the signal's axis, and
  goes in the frame that codes that sample, in the block of its 32-sample step, with `oa_sample_offset` 0;
  the decoder reports it at n + `delay_samples()` + `decoder_delay_samples()`, to within 32 samples. A
  frame sends a block at each step an update starts in, at most seven, the latest kept, each object's
  properties those in force at the step's end; an I-frame's first block sends every object whole
  (`b_no_delta`). Otherwise a block reuses an object's basic information and each render group that has
  not changed, and sends the position as a difference where each coordinate's is -4 to 3.
  `add_per_object_md()` is sent in every block of an object with trim or headphone data, since each block
  sets them afresh. The ramp is Table 94's code, Table 95's entry or `ramp_duration`, at most 2 047 samples.
- **Evidence:** Readers: each update of a moving object decodes at its sample, in A-JOC and direct-coded
  streams (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_objects.cpp`).

#### The screen factor and the depth exponent

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.8.7, `object_render_info()`, pp. 144 and 145, Table 105's `group_other_mask` and
  6.3.9.8.17 and 6.3.9.8.18, p. 195: bit 1 of `group_other_mask` sends `object_screen_factor_code` (3 bits) and
  `object_depth_factor` (2 bits) together, the factor is printed `object_screen_factor_code+1/8`, and "If the
  object_screen_factor_code element is not present, object_screen_factor shall be 0".
- **Reading:** the factor is (code + 1) / 8, from 1/8 to 1, as the decoder reads it (`apply_other()` in
  `src/ac4/src/oba/objects.cpp`), so the group has no code for a factor of 0: a factor of 0 is the group's
  absence, which also leaves the depth exponent at 1 ([the decoder's reading](#object-audio-metadata)).
  The encoder sends the group for an object whose factor is above 0 or whose exponent is not 1. An exponent
  other than 1 with a factor of 0 has no code. The encoder refuses such an object at configuration, naming the
  reason, and such properties in a metadata update as invalid input; it used to send a factor of 1/8, which
  the decoder then reported. A factor between 0 and 1/16 still rounds to 1/8, the smallest the group holds.
- **Evidence:** Text; readers: an exponent of each of Table 107's codes with its factor reads back as given
  (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_objects.cpp`), and the C API answers a configuration and an update with its two
  encoder statuses (`tests/capi/test_capi_ac4_arguments.cpp`).

#### md_compat for objects

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 55, p. 157: md_compat 0 to 3 allow 2, 6, 9 and 11 tracks; the decoder's reading
  of the table for A-JOC is 17 objects and an LFE at md_compat 3 ([The objects oamd_dyndata_multi()
  lists](#the-objects-oamd_dyndata_multi-lists)).
- **Reading:** an A-JOC presentation's tracks are its downmix signals, and it takes md_compat 3 at the
  least, 7 above 17 objects; a direct-coded one's tracks are its full-band objects, as a channel-based
  presentation's are its channels.
- **Evidence:** Text. Chromium's stream of ten downmix signals and seventeen objects is one DEE wrote.

#### Direct-coded objects

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.1.11 and 6.2.3.2: `audio_data_objs(n_objects, b_lfe)` codes the objects in the
  element `objs_to_channel_mode()` names, one, two, three or five, the LFE's `mono_data(1)` before it.
- **Reading:** the dynamic objects in their order, five a substream while five are left, then three, two or
  one; the LFE object in the first substream. The group's OAMD substream lists each substream's objects,
  the LFE first, then the element's channels in L, R, C, Ls, Rs order. Bed objects are refused here.
- **Evidence:** Readers (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_objects.cpp`).

### The MP4 sample entry's dac4

`iclforge::ac4::build_dac4()` in `src/ac4` writes Annex E.6's `ac4_dsi_v1()` from a table of contents, for the
encoder's MP4 output and for `forge mp4` alike. Every presentation of a bitstream_version 2 table of
contents is derived whole (Annex E.10 and E.11): a single substream group, each configuration of Table
53, channel-coded, A-JOC and direct-coded object groups, and an alternative presentation's name and
targets where the writer gives them (an encoder knows them; `forge mp4` reads them with the decoder);
what it cannot derive whole it refuses, and `iclforge::ac4::dac4_refusal()` says why. These are the readings it
takes. Where the evidence is DEE's MP4 muxer, the box it writes is the box `build_dac4()` writes, byte for
byte (`tests/ac4/core/test_toc.cpp`, `tools/checks/check_ac4_encode_readers.py`): for the committed DEE
streams and the encoder's single-presentation streams (but for the 3/2/2 layout's top front pair, below),
and for Chromium's A-JOC stream and DASH-IF's 5.1 test vectors, whose program identifier it copies from
the table of contents. The muxer refuses a stream of more than one presentation and does not finish one
of an alternative presentation; MediaInfo's trace of the encoder's presentation streams' boxes reads
every configuration's substream groups as written.

#### Pseudocode E.3 leaves channel groups out

- **Where:** Part 2 E.10.3, pp. 235 and 236, against Table A.27, p. 214.
- **Text:** Pseudocode E.3 sets no LFE group for any channel mode, and for `pres_ch_mode` 11 and up
  sets neither L/R nor Ls/Rs, and sets group 2 where its comment says C, which Table A.27 numbers 1.
  It never sets group 16, Lscr/Rscr: its condition is `if (0)`, "not present in any supported channel
  configuration", where Table A.27 gives the pair to the 9.X layouts, `pres_ch_mode` 13 and 14. For
  22.2 it sets group 7, Tsl/Tsr, only where `pres_top_channel_pairs` is 1, where Table A.27 has them in
  22.2 whatever the top pairs.
- **Reading:** the groups Table A.27 gives each mode: group 6 wherever the mode has an LFE (5.1, the
  7.1 modes, 7.1.4, 9.1.4 and 22.2), and for 11 and up L/R, Ls/Rs, C where `b_pres_centre_present`,
  Lb/Rb where `b_pres_4_back_channels_present` and the top pairs `pres_top_channel_pairs` names;
  Lscr/Rscr for 9.0.4 and 9.1.4, and Tsl/Tsr for 22.2. The same for `dsi_substream_channel_groups[]`.
- **Evidence:** Streams, for 5.1 and 5.1.4: DEE's muxer sets groups 0, 1, 2 and 6 for 5.1, and 0, 1, 2,
  4, 5 and 6 for its 5.1.4. Text for the 9.X layouts and 22.2, which no stream here carries.

#### The 3/2/2 layout's top front pair

- **Where:** Part 2 Table A.27, p. 214, and Pseudocode E.3, pp. 235 and 236.
- **Text:** both give the 7.X element's 3/2/2 modes (`pres_ch_mode` 9 and 10) group 4, Tfl and Tfr.
- **Reading:** group 4, as printed, in `presentation_v1_channel_groups[]` and
  `dsi_substream_channel_groups[]`.
- **Evidence:** Text, which both places agree on, against two readers. Given the encoder's 3/2/2
  streams (an experimental layout), DEE's muxer writes groups 0, 1 and 2, and 6 for 7.1, and none for
  the pair, while it writes the 3/4/0 and 5/2/0 modes' pairs (groups 3 and 17) as printed.
  MediaInfo's trace names the channel mode 7.1 3/2/2.1, and its summary counts seven channels, the
  pair as Tfc. DEE's encoder writes no 7.X layout, so neither reader has a stream of its own maker's
  to read there. `tools/checks/check_ac4_encode_readers.py` reports the muxer's box as differing in
  group 4 alone.

#### b_presentation_core_differs

- **Where:** Part 2 Table E.11, p. 233.
- **Text:** true "if the pres_ch_mode_core according to pseudocode 26 has a value of -1; or in any
  ac4_substream_group_info() of the presentation: b_channel_coded is false and b_ajoc is true".
- **Reading:** true where `pres_ch_mode_core` is not -1, as `b_presentation_core_channel_coded`'s rule,
  false where it is -1, implies; for channel-coded substreams, the immersive modes 11 to 14 (Table 71),
  and for an A-JOC substream a static downmix's 5.0 or 5.1, with Table E.14's code for the core. An A-JOC
  group alone does not set it: an adaptive downmix has no core (Pseudocode 26).
- **Evidence:** Streams. DEE's muxer writes 0 for 2.0 and 5.1, 1 with the 5.1.2 core for its 5.1.4, and 0
  for Chromium's A-JOC stream, whose one A-JOC substream has an adaptive downmix of ten signals.

#### The bit rate and the indicators

- **Where:** Part 2 Table E.7 and E.10.1.
- **Reading:** `bit_rate_mode` follows the table of contents' `wait_frames` as Table E.7 says (1 where it
  is 0, 2 where it is 1 to 6, 3 otherwise, `b_wait_frames` 0 included); `bit_rate` is written as 0,
  unknown, with `bit_rate_precision` 0xFFFFFFFF. A presentation sends `b_presentation_bitrate_info`
  where every substream of its substream groups sends `b_bitrate_info`, as Table E.11 asks, and a
  presentation of configuration 6, which has no substream to send one, sends none. `de_indicator` and
  `immersive_audio_indicator` are facts of the substreams, which a table of contents does not carry: the
  encoder gives them, whether a substream sends dialogue enhancement and 0, and a DSI built from a
  stream's table of contents alone leaves out the closing byte that holds them, as its `pres_bytes`
  allows.
- **Evidence:** Streams, for the encoder's output: DEE's muxer writes the same. For DEE's streams it
  writes mode 2 and sets `de_indicator`, which `forge mp4` cannot see from the table of contents. Text
  for configuration 6.

#### A presentation's channel mode, core and channel groups

- **Where:** Part 2 E.10.2, p. 232: `dsi_presentation_ch_mode` and `pres_b_4_back_channels_present`,
  `pres_top_channel_pairs` and the channel groups come from Pseudocode 25 and clauses 6.3.3.1.29 to
  6.3.3.1.30; E.10.3 from `b_pres_centre_present` too (6.3.3.1.29a).
- **Reading:** the decoder's ([presentation_config 1 and 4 read more specifiers than
  n_substream_groups](#presentation_config-1-and-4-read-more-specifiers-than-n_substream_groups)
  and [The presentation substream](#the-presentation-substream)): every substream of
  every group the specifiers name, a group named twice once, `superset()` by the channels each mode holds,
  and `b_pres_centre_present` the disjunction of the substreams' `b_centre_present`, where they send
  one. A group the table of contents does not carry (`b_multi_pid`) cannot be described, and is refused.
  Each group gets its own `ac4_substream_group_dsi()` in its specifiers' order, a group named twice
  twice.
- **Evidence:** Text; MediaInfo reads the encoder's presentation streams' boxes as written.

#### An A-JOC substream's objects

- **Where:** Part 2 Table E.15, p. 238: `b_substream_contains_bed_objects` and its siblings of an A-JOC
  substream "match the values transmitted in ac4_substream_info_ajoc", which transmits the upmix's
  `bed_dyn_obj_assignment()` (6.2.1.10), whose syntax lists bed and ISF objects and no dynamic ones.
- **Reading:** the upmix holds bed objects where the assignment lists one, ISF objects likewise, and
  dynamic objects where it lists fewer objects than `n_fullband_upmix_signals`, all of them where
  `b_dyn_objects_only` is set. A direct-coded object substream holds what its `b_dynamic_objects`,
  `b_bed_objects` and `b_isf` say, a substream continuing a bed or an ISF set included. The encoder's
  A-JOC substreams send the downmix's signals as dynamic objects only, and the upmix's bed objects first,
  listed by `nonstd_bed_channel_assignment` (`b_channel_assignment_flags_present` 0), with its dynamic
  objects after them.
- **Evidence:** Streams, for the dynamic case: DEE's muxer writes 0, 1 and 0 for Chromium's A-JOC
  stream, whose upmix of seventeen signals is dynamic objects only. Readers for the encoder's bed objects,
  which decode as the bed objects they were given (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_objects.cpp`). Text for the
  rest.

#### An alternative presentation's dac4

- **Where:** Part 2 E.12, pp. 239 and 240: `alternative_info()` carries `name_len` in 16 bits and the
  name, `n_targets` ("the value of n_targets_minus1 + 1") in 5 bits, and for each target
  `target_md_compat` in 3 bits and `target_device_category` in 8 bits, "the respective field defined in
  clause 6.3.3.1.7", which the presentation substream sends as four Booleans (Table 67) with four more
  bits behind `b_tdc_extension`.
- **Reading:** the name's bytes without the 0 the presentation substream closes a whole name with, and
  `name_len` counting them; `n_targets` the number of targets; `target_device_category` Table 67's four
  Booleans, index 0 first, in its upper four bits and the extension's four in the lower, 0 where
  `b_tdc_extension` is 0. The table of contents does not carry them, so `build_dac4()` refuses an
  alternative presentation whose writer has not given them.
- **Evidence:** Text. MediaInfo reads the name and the first target as written, then a second target:
  it takes `n_targets` for `n_targets_minus1`. DEE's muxer, given the encoder's stream of one alternative
  presentation, writes nothing in 60 seconds and has to be stopped, so it settles nothing here.

### Manifests and CMAF tracks

`forge fmp4`, and `record` and `live` with `container=fmp4`, fragment AC-4 into a CMAF track (Part 2
Annex H) with an HLS playlist and a DASH MPD (Annex G). `src/ac4` reads what the manifests say off the
table of contents (`iclforge::ac4::signalled_presentation()`, `iclforge::ac4::rfc6381_codec_string()`,
`iclforge::ac4::dash_channel_configuration()`, `iclforge::ac4::dash_supplemental_properties()`,
`iclforge::ac4::presentation_channel_count()`), and `src/containers/src/mp4` writes the track, each fragment starting at a sync
sample (E.3) and listing each sample's flags where a fragment holds a frame that is not an I-frame
(E.2). These are the readings.

#### The presentation a manifest describes

- **Where:** Part 2 G.2.3, p. 247: "AdaptationSet elements should signal the properties of the AC-4
  presentation with the widest compatibility"; E.13, p. 240, takes the codecs parameter's
  `presentation_version` and `md_compat` "for the presentation".
- **Text:** neither clause says what makes one presentation more widely compatible than another, or
  which presentation E.13 means.
- **Reading:** the lowest `md_compat` (Table 55, the level a decoder needs), among the presentations
  that carry audio and that the stream does not disable, the first in the table of contents where
  several share it; the first presentation where none carries audio. The codecs parameter, the channel
  configuration, the frame rate and pre-virtualized descriptors and HLS's channel count all describe
  this one. It is the first presentation for every stream DEE writes and for every stream of one
  presentation, which is what `rfc6381_codec_string()` took before.
- **Evidence:** Text. No player here reads an AC-4 manifest.

#### The "Dolby:2015" channel configuration's bit order

- **Where:** Part 2 G.3.3.2, p. 248, and Table G.1, p. 249.
- **Text:** "bit n in {0 ... 17} is set to ac4_dsi_v1/presentation_channel_group[17 - n]", where
  Pseudocode E.3 indexes that array by Table A.27's channel group, which would put L/R (group 0) at bit
  17. The clause's Example 1 gives 5.1.2 (groups 0, 1, 2, 6 and 7) as `0000C7`, Example 2 object audio
  as `800000`, and every row of Table G.1 has group g at bit g (stereo `000001`, mono `000002`, 5.1
  `000047`).
- **Reading:** group g at bit g, as both examples and the table have it: the index in "[17 - n]" is the
  order the array's elements are sent in, the first being group 17 (E.10.2). Bit 23 is set for object
  audio, and Table G.1's MPEG value is signalled instead wherever the groups match a row, as G.3.3.1
  prefers.
- **Evidence:** The clause's two examples and Table G.1's 27 rows agree with each other and not with the
  sentence.

#### A single-stream track's brands

- **Where:** Part 2 H.4, Table H.1, p. 253: 'ca4m' for the AC-4 CMAF main profile (H.1.2.1, H.1.2.2,
  H.3), 'ca4s' for the single-stream profile (H.1.2.1, H.1.2.3, H.3), "a subprofile of the AC-4 CMAF
  main profile".
- **Reading:** a track holding every substream group its presentations name, none of them with
  `b_multi_pid` (H.1.2.3), lists both brands after 'cmfc': it keeps the single-stream profile, and
  H.1.2.2's rules apply only where a presentation's groups are spread over several tracks, so it keeps
  the main profile too, which H.4 makes the default. A stream with `b_multi_pid` is refused, since one
  track cannot hold its other groups.
- **Evidence:** Text.

### The presentation substream

#### dialnorm_bits

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.12.2.1: the dialogue level in 0.25 dB steps from 0 to -31.75 dBFS.
- **Reading:** `dialnorm_bits` is the level's magnitude over 0.25, rounded; `forge ac4-encode`'s
  `dialnorm=` takes it in steps of 0.25 dB from 0 to 31.75, as the field is coded.
- **Evidence:** Readers.

#### A drc_frame() with no DRC

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.2.3: `drc_metadata_size_value` counts the bits of `drc_frame()`.
- **Reading:** a frame that sends no DRC writes `drc_frame()` as `b_drc_present` 0 alone, and a size of
  one bit; `tools_metadata_size` of the audio substream's `metadata()` is likewise one bit,
  `b_de_data_present` 0.
- **Evidence:** Readers: both readers hold these sizes to the bits read.

#### Dialogue enhancement and DRC in the frame's metadata

The writer takes the decoder's reading of each of these (phase E5):

- [de_data() predicts from the wrong channel](#de_data-predicts-from-the-wrong-channel):
  a channel after the first is sent along its own bands in an I-frame.
- [Dialogue enhancement and DRC configuration across I-frames](#dialogue-enhancement-and-drc-configuration-across-i-frames):
  `de_config()` and `drc_config()` go in I-frames, and a frame between them sends `b_de_config_flag` 0,
  and `b_drc_present` 0 unless a mode sends gains.
- [drc_repeat_id copies a whole mode](#drc_repeat_id-copies-a-whole-mode): a repeat of
  a mode that sends gains sends a gainset in `drc_data()` too, that mode's gains again.
- [drc_gains() is a brace short](#drc_gains-is-a-brace-short) and
  [DRC's units](#drcs-units): gains in whole dB2, frequency-differential along the
  first subframe's bands and time-differential along each band's subframes.
- [When dialogue enhancement's, DRC's and the downmix's values apply](#when-dialogue-enhancements-drcs-and-the-downmixs-values-apply):
  a frame's dialogue enhancement parameters and DRC gains are computed on the block its control data
  meets (above, "Where the encoder's QMF slots fall").

#### drc_gainset_size counts drc_version

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.13.5.1, p. 130 ("the size in bits of the following drc_gains element"), against
  Table 74, p. 67 (`bits_left = drc_gainset_size - 2 - used_bits`).
- **Reading:** the formula's: the size counts `drc_version`'s two bits and `drc_gains()`, which is what
  a reader skipping a gainset by its size needs. The decoder accepts either reading at `drc_version` 0
  ([drc_gainset_size does and does not count drc_version](#drc_gainset_size-does-and-does-not-count-drc_version)).
- **Evidence:** Readers. Transmitted gains are experimental (`experimental=drc-gains-0` to
  `drc-gains-3`, one for each DRC mode): no stream DEE writes sends them.

### Presentations

The table of contents of several presentations and their mixing fields (`src/ac4/src/encoder/frame/toc_writer.cpp`
and `metadata.cpp`), which phase D7's test multiplexer writes, and the encoder's presentations of several
substreams (`src/ac4/src/encoder/encoder.cpp`), phase E6's. The writer takes the decoder's reading of each of
these:

- [presentation_config 1 and 4 read more specifiers than n_substream_groups](#presentation_config-1-and-4-read-more-specifiers-than-n_substream_groups)
  and [Substream group gains](#substream-group-gains): every specifier the
  configuration reads, and `sg_gain` for n_substream_groups groups as 6.2.1.3 assigns it: none for
  configuration 1, the main and associated groups' for configuration 4.
- [The dialogue's gain and pans](#the-dialogues-gain-and-pans) and
  [Panning](#panning): `dialog_max_gain` for a g_dialog_max of (1 + `dialog_max_gain`)
  x 3 dB, and pans in 1.5 degree steps clockwise from the front, 330 degrees L and 30 degrees R.
- [The main audio's and the dialogue's scaling with associated audio](#the-main-audios-and-the-dialogues-scaling-with-associated-audio):
  `scale_main`, `scale_main_centre` and `scale_main_front` at -0.3 dB a step, 255 for silence.
- [The hybrid dialogue enhancement's waveform](#the-hybrid-dialogue-enhancements-waveform):
  a hybrid method's `de_signal_contribution` sets the waveform's share, alpha_c = x / 31, of the gain,
  and the dialogue enhancement substream's channels are d_c in that entry's order (below, "The hybrid
  methods' waveform").
- [Which presentations can be selected](#which-presentations-can-be-selected): each
  presentation's `md_compat` is the least its tracks allow (below, "Tracks for md_compat"), so that a
  decoder of that level can select it; a caller may set a higher one, and 7 is selected only by a
  decoder told its level is 7.
- [The order of the preferences](#the-order-of-the-preferences): a presentation's
  language is its dialogue substream's, else its main or music and effects substream's. Each substream's
  language goes in its own group's `content_type()`, so an associated substream's tag, which may be one
  of Table 92's codes such as `qad`, never gives a presentation its language.
- [b_associated and b_dialog are parameters at sus_ver 0](#b_associated-and-b_dialog-are-parameters-at-sus_ver-0):
  at sus_ver 1 the writer sends `b_dialog` for a substream that is the dialogue of a presentation or is
  classified as dialogue, with its mixing values, in every frame.
- [Levelling before the mix](#levelling-before-the-mix): a version 1 presentation
  carries one dialnorm, in its presentation substream, and levels nothing, so each presentation substream
  sends the dialnorm its substreams share: the presentation's own, else the stream's.
- [oamd_dyndata_single() in metadata() of a channel-coded substream](#oamd_dyndata_single-in-metadata-of-a-channel-coded-substream):
  a channel-coded substream sends none, so one substream serves an alternative presentation and others
  alike.
- [The end of an EMDF payload list](#the-end-of-an-emdf-payload-list): each list ends
  with an `emdf_payload_id` of 0 and the alignment, and nothing between.
- [The presentation substream](#the-presentation-substream): `superset(0, 1)` is 1,
  so stereo main audio with mono dialogue or associated audio is a stereo presentation, and the fields
  that follow `pres_ch_mode`, `custom_dmx_data()` and `loud_corr()`, follow the superset.

#### Tracks for md_compat

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.2.2.3 and Table 55, p. 157: md_compat 0 to 3 allow 2, 6, 9 and 11 tracks, "the
  total number of audio objects and channels in all substreams contributing to the presentation, with the
  exception of LFE channels that have the b_lfe flag set in mono_data() structure", and 7 is
  "Unrestricted".
- **Reading:** a presentation's tracks are the channels of every substream it names but the LFE, its
  dialogue enhancement substream's among them, whose waveform joins the output (Part 1 5.7.8.9). The
  writer sends the least level that holds them, 7 above 11 tracks, and refuses a level set below it or in
  4 to 6. One substream alone is level 0 in mono and stereo, 1 in 5.X and 2 in 7.X.
- **Evidence:** Streams. DEE's streams carry level 0 in stereo, 1 in 5.1 and 2 in 5.1.4, whose nine
  tracks the reading counts, each with `presentation_id` 0 on its one presentation, as the encoder's
  single presentation now has (phases E1 to E5 wrote level 0 and no `presentation_id`). MediaInfo lists
  each committed presentation's level as configured, and the decoder selects each at it
  (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_presentations.cpp`).

#### A presentation_id for every presentation that carries audio

- **Where:** Part 2 Annex H.1.2.1, p. 250: in an AC-4 CMAF track of several presentations "each
  presentation shall have a unique presentation_id", and "for every presentation presentation_id shall be
  present in every AC-4 sample"; 6.2.1.3, p. 114, reads no `b_presentation_id` for `presentation_config`
  6.
- **Reading:** every presentation of configurations 0 to 5, and every presentation of one substream
  group, carries a `presentation_id` in every frame, no two the same; a configuration 6 presentation,
  EMDF payloads alone, has no field for one. The writer takes configuration 6 as Part 2's syntax has it,
  and an MP4 that is not fragmented carries it (Annex E.10). A CMAF track cannot, since "every
  presentation" includes it: `iclforge::ac4::cmaf_refusal()` refuses a stream with one, and `forge fmp4` with it
  (phase E7). A writer that wants a CMAF track carries the payloads in a presentation that plays audio,
  in the EMDF payloads substream its `emdf_info()` names.
- **Evidence:** Text. DEE's muxer, given the encoder's EMDF stream, warns that its second presentation "is
  missing a presentation_id", and refuses the stream, as it refuses every stream of more than one
  presentation.

#### An alternative presentation's name

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.2.3, p. 123, and 6.3.3.1.1 to 6.3.3.1.4, p. 167: `name_len` in five bits, or 32
  bytes where `b_length` is 0; a name whose last byte is 0 is whole, and one whose last byte is not is a
  chunk of a name serialized over several frames, the last chunk counting them.
- **Reading:** a name of at most 31 bytes of UTF-8, none of them 0, sent whole in every frame: its bytes
  and a 0, with `name_len` counting the 0 where that is below 32, and the 32-byte form for a name of 31
  bytes. A longer name, which only the chunked form holds, is refused.
- **Evidence:** Readers. MediaInfo frames the name where the writer put it, showing its bytes as data,
  and the decoder's and the Python parser's traces read the name and the 0.

#### An alternative presentation's target

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.2.3, pp. 123 and 124, and 6.3.3.1.5 to 6.3.3.1.15, pp. 167 and 168: one target
  or more, each with a `target_level` "similar to the md_compat element", Table 67's four device
  categories, an optional ducking depth and loudness correction, and for each substream `b_active` and
  `alt_data_set_index`, which picks one of the alternative object metadata sets an object substream's
  `oamd_dyndata_single()` carries; 4.8.2, p. 40: alternative presentations apply "alternative metadata
  to the selected substreams". Nothing says what a decoder does with a target.
- **Reading:** a channel-coded substream has no alternative metadata sets, so an alternative presentation
  of channel-coded substreams carries its name and one target: the presentation's `md_compat`, every
  device category, no ducking depth or loudness correction, and every substream active with
  `alt_data_set_index` 0, none.
- **Evidence:** Text; Readers.

#### 3.0 substreams

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.7.1, p. 77: "The 3.0 channel mode shall only be used" for "coding of the
  enhancement signal for the Dialogue Enhancement (DE) feature" and for "coding of the dialogue in a
  music and effects + dialogue presentation".
- **Reading:** a 3.0 substream is a hybrid method's dialogue enhancement substream, or the dialogue of a
  configuration 0 or 3 presentation, or of a configuration 5 one whose main group is classified music and
  effects. A presentation of one substream group, which gives it no other role, may also play it alone,
  so long as a music and effects presentation carries it as dialogue. 3.0 as main or associated audio, or
  as dialogue beside a complete main, is refused. The 3.0 element is experimental
  (`experimental=three-zero`): no DEE stream has one.
- **Evidence:** Readers. The decoder and the Python parser read the committed 3.0 stream
  (`tests/golden/ac4/presentations/encoder-three-zero.ac4`) as the encoder wrote it, MediaInfo lists
  it as configured, and the decoder mixes the dialogue channel to channel into the music and effects'
  L, R and C.

#### The hybrid methods' waveform

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.8.9, pp. 253 and 254: the hybrid methods add the waveform d_c to the output; the
  text gives the decoder's equations and says nothing of the signal a writer puts in d_c.
- **Reading:** d_c is the dialogue the parameters raise. With the channel independent method, the
  dialogue of each processed channel, from the stem or from the channels marked as dialogue, one channel
  each in L, R, C order; with the Mid, L's and R's dialogue summed, which 1/2 (1, 1) halves into each;
  with the cross-channel method, the dialogue projected on r, its panning, which the writer estimates from
  the dialogue's energy in each channel, averaged with a leak whose time constant is half a second. The
  waveform's share alpha_c is the caller's (`DialogueConfig::waveform_share`), sent as
  `de_signal_contribution`.
- **Evidence:** Text; each method's output measures to 0.01 dB against the main and the waveform decoded
  alone, as the decoder's reading combines them (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_presentations.cpp`).

#### Mixing values across I-frames

- **Where:** Part 1 6.2.16.0, p. 268: the mixing metadata "are not necessarily sent with each frame, and
  not necessarily with each I-frame, although this is encouraged", and "remain valid until new ones are
  transmitted"; Part 2 6.3.3.1.22 to 6.3.3.1.24, p. 170: `b_keep` repeats the last group gains; 6.3.2.11.2,
  p. 166: `b_pres_ndot` says "whether a presentation substream can be decoded independently from
  preceding frames".
- **Reading:** an I-frame's presentation substream sends every mixing value the presentation is
  configured with, and sets `b_pres_ndot`; a frame between I-frames keeps the group gains with `b_keep`,
  sends no associated audio's values, which hold, and clears `b_pres_ndot`. A dialogue substream's values
  (`b_dialog`) go in every frame, since the decoder's reading sets g_dialog_max to 0 dB at an I-frame
  that does not send them.
- **Evidence:** Readers; every mix of the committed streams measures its configured gains.

#### The substreams' order

- **Where:** Part 1 4.2.3.11, p. 33, and 4.3.3.12.4, p. 81: `substream_index_table()` gives the
  substreams' sizes in the order the frame carries them; Part 2 4.8.2, p. 40: a presentation finds its
  substreams by each info element's `substream_index`. Nothing orders the presentation, audio and EMDF
  payload substreams.
- **Reading:** the presentation substreams first, in the presentations' order, then the audio
  substreams, in the groups' order, then the EMDF payload substreams.
- **Evidence:** Streams. librempeg takes the substream after the presentation substreams as a
  presentation's first group's audio: with an EMDF payload substream there, it refused the frame ("invalid
  audio_size"). MediaInfo reads either order.

#### EMDF

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.6.1 and 4.3.3.6.2, p. 77: `emdf_version` "shall be set to 0", and the text
  "defines no semantics" for `key_id`; Part 2 6.2.1.3, p. 114: a presentation names an EMDF payloads
  substream in its `emdf_info()`, and configuration 6 in `b_add_emdf_substreams`' list.
- **Reading:** `emdf_version` 0 and `key_id` 0, with no protection bytes. A presentation's payloads go in
  an EMDF payloads substream of their own that its `emdf_info()` names, configuration 6's in one its list
  names, and a substream's in its `metadata()` (`b_emdf_payloads_substream`); each in every frame, as the
  caller gives them.
- **Evidence:** Readers. MediaInfo frames the EMDF payloads substream without detailing it, and names a
  substream's payloads `umd_payload`.

#### DRC gains for a presentation of several substreams

- **Where:** Part 1 6.2.13, p. 268: the decoder's DRC side chain is the signal before dialogue
  enhancement. Nothing says what signal a writer computes transmitted gains (`drc_gains()`) from where a
  presentation mixes several substreams.
- **Reading:** the presentation's main or music and effects substream's input alone. The decoder's side
  chain is the mix of the substreams ([Where the substreams are mixed](#where-the-substreams-are-mixed)),
  so these gains leave the dialogue's and the associated audio's level out; transmitted gains are
  experimental (`experimental=drc-gains-0` to `drc-gains-3`), and the encoder does not compute them from
  the mix, with the presentation's gains, pans and scaling.
- **Evidence:** Text.

### Rates

#### What wait_frames counts

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.2.4 and Table 81, p. 73: the frames a decoder "should wait" after receiving
  the frame before its output; 6.2.4, p. 263, and Part 2 Annex B, pp. 217 and 218, which estimates the
  rate from sizes over m frames and `m + wait_frames(0) - wait_frames(m)`, give it a buffer's meaning.
- **Reading:** the whole frame periods between the frame's arrival, whole, over a channel at the
  stream's rate and its output, for a decoder that starts at the frame: its slack, floored (in twos at
  indices 10 to 12, where Table 81 counts in twos). Such a decoder outputs the frame up to a frame (two)
  early, so each frame keeps at least a frame (two) of slack and at most what the buffer holds: 1 to 5
  frames, or 2 to 11. Over m frames the sizes then come to within a frame (two) of Annex B's N'.
- **Evidence:** Text. The tests check, frame by frame and from the stream alone, that a decoder starting
  at any frame is never fed a frame late and that its buffer never holds more than 6.2.4 sets.

#### br_code carries the raw frames' rate

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.2.1.2 and Annex B, steps 2 to 4 and 13.
- **Reading:** the sequence carries the rate of the raw frames, `raw_ac4_frame()`s, in kbps, which is
  the rate the encoder is given; Annex B adds a sync frame's overhead to it as B. The writer sends 0b11
  and six base-3 digits of the fraction of log2 of the rate, a precision of 3^-6 of an octave, then 0b11
  again.
- **Evidence:** Text.
