// Exclusive-mode IEC 61937 passthrough: hand already-packed AC-3, E-AC-3 or
// AC-4 bursts to an S/PDIF or HDMI endpoint so the AV receiver on the other
// end decodes them itself and lights its Dolby Digital / Dolby Digital Plus
// indicator.
//
// AC-4 (IEC 61937-14) goes only where the platform has a way to send it,
// which is where its audio API takes IEC 61937 bursts as opaque two-channel
// data with the non-audio flag set rather than naming the codec: ALSA, and
// Android's ENCODING_IEC61937. WASAPI negotiates a codec-specific subformat
// and the Windows SDK (ksmedia.h, 10.0.26100) defines none for AC-4;
// PipeWire's IEC 958 format names a codec and its list (spa/param/audio/
// iec958.h, 1.6) has no AC-4; Core Audio retunes a stream to a codec's format
// ID and its list (CoreAudioBaseTypes.h) has no AC-4 either. Those three
// refuse every AC-4 format with kUnsupportedFormat. AC-4 HBR16 needs the
// eight-channel high-bit-rate link, which no backend here opens, so ALSA and
// Android refuse it the same way.
//
// Exclusive mode is mandatory. In shared mode the Windows audio engine would
// treat the bursts as ordinary PCM and mix, resample or volume-scale them;
// any of those corrupts the bit pattern and the receiver hears static or
// loses lock. Exclusive mode hands the endpoint our bytes untouched.
//
// The burst packing itself lives in iclforge::iec61937 (byte-exact against
// FFmpeg's spdif muxer, and for E-AC-3 also cross-checked against Microsoft's
// own IEC 61937 documentation); this is only delivery.
