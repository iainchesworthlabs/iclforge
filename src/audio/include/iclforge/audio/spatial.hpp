// Windows Spatial Sound object rendering (Windows spatial object renderer): hand decoded Atmos
// objects to the OS's own object renderer - ISpatialAudioObjectRenderStream -
// as DYNAMIC objects carrying their real OAMD positions, and the programme's
// bed as STATIC ones.
//
// This is the one path that lets Dolby's own renderer engage with this
// project's reconstructed objects at all: a licensed decoder refuses to
// object-decode a stream this project has no signing key for (see
// CONTRIBUTING.md's "Object reconstruction has none of the four [oracles]"),
// but ISpatialAudioObjectRenderStream is gated on nothing but a spatial-
// sound-capable endpoint. What this sink does with a position is genuinely
// computed by Windows Sonic/Dolby Atmos's HRTF renderer, not by anything in
// this repository - the whole reason it is worth building.
//
// This header is deliberately codec-blind, the same way iclforge::containers::iec61937's
// framing is the only iclforge::ac3-adjacent thing iclforge::audio depends on: it
// knows nothing about OAMD, JOC, or which of a programme's objects are bed
// vs dynamic. That interpretation (see apps/cli/commands/live_audio.cpp's
// run_spatial) is the caller's job, for the same layering reason PassthroughSink
// doesn't know what IEC 61937 framing means either. A static object's
// channel identity is expressed as a WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE SPEAKER_* bit - the
// same vocabulary MonitorSink::start's channel_mask already uses - rather
// than a Windows-Spatial-API-specific enum, so the library has one channel-
// identity vocabulary throughout; the Windows backend privately maps
// SPEAKER_FRONT_LEFT etc. to AudioObjectType_FrontLeft etc.
