// The Android backend's pure half, split out for the same reason
// platform/alsa/device_names.hpp is: everything here compiles and tests on a
// machine with no Android SDK/NDK at all, unlike the rest of this directory
// (passthrough.cpp, monitor.cpp), which needs <jni.h>/<aaudio/AAudio.h> and a
// real Android toolchain. Not part of the library's public interface -
// backend-internal, like alsa_support.hpp/device_names.hpp are for ALSA.

// covers the same span of time, so the link has to clock four times as fast
// to deliver it - Microsoft's "Representing Formats for IEC 61937
// Transmissions" states it as a requirement, and it is not an
// WASAPI-specific one. The Kotlin PassthroughBridge's AudioTrack is opened
// with AudioFormat.ENCODING_IEC61937 (pre-wrapped bursts straight through,
// not ENCODING_E_AC3's "raw elementary frames, Android wraps them" contract
// - see passthrough.cpp's header comment for why), which is exactly the
// same "the declared rate describes the wire, not the content" situation
// ALSA/WASAPI are already in - so PassthroughSink::start() passes THIS
// value to PassthroughBridge.open(), not the raw content sample_rate. AC-4's
// link runs at the content rate and its HBR4 link at 4x (audio::
// carrier_ratio()).

// WASAPI-style per-endpoint enumeration to walk - see
// enumerate_render_devices()'s own comment), so the id/name/is_default
// fields are fixed rather than read from anywhere. `ac4_supported` is the
