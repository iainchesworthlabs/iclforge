#include "iclforge/audio/passthrough.hpp"

// The ALSA passthrough backend. CMake compiles this directory's
// passthrough.cpp on a Linux host whose libasound development headers are
// present and another directory's everywhere else, so there is no #ifdef -
// the file's path is what says "ALSA".
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why this is the backend that decided which Linux audio API to use
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Capture is an ordinary PCM stream and every Linux audio API can do it.
// Bitstreaming is not, and ALSA is the layer where it is expressed:
//
//   * ALSA does it by opening a plain 16-bit stereo PCM whose IEC 60958
//     channel status has the non-audio bit set. The bit travels with the
//     samples down the S/PDIF or HDMI link and is what makes the receiver
//     decode rather than reproduce them. device_names.hpp is that bit.
//   * PulseAudio does it with PA_STREAM_PASSTHROUGH and an AC-3 pa_format_info
//     - a real capability, but one that ends in the same ALSA call, made by
//     the daemon instead of by us.
//   * PipeWire does it with SPA_MEDIA_SUBTYPE_iec958 and an AC-3 codec, and
//     likewise finishes in ALSA.
//
// So ALSA is not merely the lowest common denominator here; it is the layer
// the other two are implemented on top of, it is present on every Linux system
// including ones with no sound server at all, and its device string is what
// gives a caller direct, unmixed access to the hardware. The cost is
// coexistence: opening a hw: device takes it exclusively, so a running sound
// server has to have released it - which is the same bargain WASAPI exclusive
// mode strikes, and for the same reason. A PipeWire backend is the sensible
// second one to add, as a sibling directory selected the same way; it would
// buy politeness, not capability.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Exclusive mode, ALSA-style
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// There is no share-mode flag to set. The `iec958` and `hdmi` device names
// resolve to the hardware device directly, with none of dmix's mixing,
// resampling or volume scaling in the way - which is precisely what exclusive
// mode buys on Windows. A device already held by another process simply fails
// to open, and that is reported as kExclusiveUnavailable.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AC-3 and E-AC-3
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One difference runs through every function here: a Dolby Digital Plus burst
// is four times the size of a Dolby Digital one and covers the same span of
// time, so its link runs four times as fast. 48 kHz content therefore opens
// the device at 192 kHz - which is why most S/PDIF outputs enumerate with
// supports_eac3_passthrough false while supports_ac3_passthrough is true. An
// optical or coaxial link is not specified past 96 kHz; HDMI is where E-AC-3
// actually goes.
//
// AC-4 (IEC 61937-14) needs nothing ALSA does not already do: the channel
// status says "not audio" whatever the codec, so AC-4's bursts go out the way
// AC-3's do, on a link at the content rate, and its HBR4 bursts at 4x the way
// E-AC-3's do. An AC-4 burst is as long as its frame, which follows the
// stream's frame rate, so the queue holds bursts of different lengths and the
// counts below are kept in bytes. AC-4 HBR16 needs the eight-channel
// high-bit-rate link, which this backend does not open, and is refused.
