# AC-4 encoder: readings

The readings this encoder takes where ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1 (Part 1) and ETSI TS 103 190-2 V1.3.1
(Part 2) leave a writer's choice open. Where the decoder depends on the same reading,
`src/ac4/ERRATA.md` has the entry and this page points at it; the writer and both readers take it.

The evidence for a reading is one of:

- **Readers**: what the encoder writes is read back as written. The decoder's reader and the encoder's own
  trace agree record for record on every stream the tests and the fuzz target `fuzz_ac4_encode` write. The
  encoder-space harness (`tools/ci/fuzz_ac4_encoder_space.py`) holds them and the Python parser
  (`tools/references/ac4_syntax.py`) to one trace on every stream it writes, and FFmpeg's raw AC-4 and mov
  demuxers frame them.
- **Streams**: DEE's streams, or a reader outside this project, settle it.
- **Text**: the text alone.

Later phases add the readings their tools need.

## Shared with the decoder

The writer takes the decoder's reading of each of these:

- [audio_size covers the fill](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#audio_size-covers-the-fill): a frame's bits beyond
  its audio are `fill_bits` inside `audio_size`, before `metadata()`.
- [byte_align is relative to the substream](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#byte_align-is-relative-to-the-substream).
- [ext_code is at most 21 bits](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#ext_code-is-at-most-21-bits): the quantiser clips a
  line at 8191, and a band whose peak would pass it takes a coarser step.
- [Scale factors outside 0 to 255](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#scale-factors-outside-0-to-255): every scale
  factor the deltas reach stays in range.
- [Pseudocode 59's stray block](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#pseudocode-59s-stray-block): the M/S matrix and the
  prediction, with `0.1f` a float, and an `alpha_q` sent against a pair of bands `sap_data()` sent no
  coefficient for counted from 0.
- [Full scale, and the overlap-add's factor of two](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#full-scale-and-the-overlap-adds-factor-of-two),
  [KBD_RIGHT's argument](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#kbd_rights-argument) and
  [The KBD kernel is summed to p = N](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-kbd-kernel-is-summed-to-p-n): the forward
  transform is the transpose of the decoder's, through the same windows, with lines scaled by 2^16 so
  that a full-scale input decodes at full scale.
- [Partial coupling starts at acpl_param_band](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#partial-coupling-starts-at-acpl_param_band):
  the A-CPL writer (`src/ac4/src/encoder/acpl/acpl_syntax.hpp`, phase D5's, for the constructed streams and
  for E4) sends each parameter set from `acpl_param_band`, its first value along frequency from the F0
  codebook, as Table 65 reads it.
- The immersive element (phase D9's, for the constructed 7.X.4 streams): the frame writer's 7.X.4 channel
  modes with their presence flags, and the A-JCC writer (`src/ac4/src/encoder/ajcc/ajcc_syntax.hpp`), take
  [The framing of the immersive element's chparam_info()](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-framing-of-the-immersive-elements-chparam_info)
  and [immersive_codec_mode_code in the trace](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#immersive_codec_mode_code-in-the-trace);
  `custom_dmx_data()` sends custom downmix data for the height downmix alone ("The height downmix", below)
  and `loud_corr()` no correction for the immersive outputs.
- The channel renderer (phase D9's): the frame writer's `top_channels_present` takes
  [Where a .2 source's top pair is carried](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#where-a-2-sources-top-pair-is-carried), and
  a writer that sends custom downmix data in I-frames alone, as DEE does, relies on
  [Custom downmix data](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#custom-downmix-data) to hold them between.
- Object audio (phase D10's, for the constructed object streams of `tests/ac4/decoder/ac4dec_objects.cpp`):
  the A-JOC writer (`src/ac4/src/encoder/ajoc/ajoc_syntax.hpp`), the object audio metadata writer
  (`src/ac4/src/encoder/oamd/oamd_syntax.hpp`) and the table of contents' object groups take
  [Arrays read as one field](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#arrays-read-as-one-field),
  [Prefix codes in the trace](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#prefix-codes-in-the-trace),
  [add_per_object_md()'s parameters](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#add_per_object_mds-parameters),
  [n_objects_code and the LFE](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#n_objects_code-and-the-lfe),
  [The objects of a direct-coded substream](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-objects-of-a-direct-coded-substream),
  [Which oamd_timing_data() applies](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#which-oamd_timing_data-applies) and
  [var_channel_element()'s A-SPX and companding](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#var_channel_elements-a-spx-and-companding).
  Each budget the syntax gives a nested element (`add_data_bytes`, `add_table_data_size_minus1`, the
  `skip_bits` of `ajoc_bed_info()` and `ext_prec_alt_pos()`) is the fewest bytes that hold what is sent,
  measured as the decoder measures it; where bits of an `add_data` budget are left after `trim()`, the
  decoder reads `bed_render_info()` and then `headphone()` from them, so the writer sends those two, absent
  where nothing is given for them, before the padding.

## The QMF domain

The readings phase E2 takes for the ASPX codec mode: companding and A-SPX, written. The writer takes the
decoder's reading of each of these, and the tests and the encoder-space harness hold the three traces
equal on every ASPX stream they write:

- [Every codec mode passes through the QMF banks](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#every-codec-mode-passes-through-the-qmf-banks):
  an ASPX stream lags its input by the SIMPLE mode's delay, 4,385 samples at `frame_rate_index` 13.
- [Companding measures against full scale 1.0](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#companding-measures-against-full-scale-10),
  [Companding's slots are Q_low's](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#compandings-slots-are-q_lows) and
  [The companding average](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-companding-average): the compressor below inverts the
  expander those readings give; the writer sends `b_compand_on` per channel and never `sync_flag`.
- [The estimated envelope's time divisor](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-estimated-envelopes-time-divisor): a
  signal envelope is the input's mean energy per QMF subsample over its groups and slots.
- [The first signal scale factor below zero](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-first-signal-scale-factor-below-zero):
  an envelope coded along frequency whose first value is below the F0 codebooks' floor sends 0 there, and
  the second group's value takes it over.
- [The sinusoid's subband](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-sinusoids-subband), [b_sine_at_end](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#b_sine_at_end)
  and [Before the first interval](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#before-the-first-interval): what the encoder keeps
  of the decoder's state to choose delta coding and sinusoids.
- [Pre-flattening's direction](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#pre-flattenings-direction): the encoder runs the
  decoder's high frequency generator on its input's low band to choose inverse filtering, noise floors and
  sinusoids, and flattens the patch as the decoder does. Phase D4 changed the reading.

### Where the encoder's QMF slots fall

- **Where:** Part 1 Table 188's `d_pcm` and `d_ctrl`, 5.7.3's analysis, and 5.7.6.3.2's
  `ts_offset_hfgen`, read from the writer's side: which input samples a frame's A-SPX data describes.
- **Reading:** the decoder's QMF slot g covers the 64 samples of the encoder's delayed input from
  `64 g - d_pcm`, since the output of the inverse transform is held `d_pcm` samples before the
  analysis; frame f's control data arrives `d_ctrl` frames later, behind `ts_offset_hfgen` slots, so its
  interval's slot i is QMF slot `num_qmf_timeslots (f + d_ctrl) - ts_offset_hfgen + i`: at
  `frame_rate_index` 13, 352 samples, 1 frame and 6 slots, `32 (f + 1) - 6 + i`. The encoder analyses
  its input with the decoder's own bank on that axis and estimates each frame's envelopes, noise floors
  and inverse filtering over those slots, and dialogue enhancement's and DRC's values over the same
  block, where the decoder's output stages meet them.
- **Evidence:** Streams and Readers. The encoder's ASPX streams decode at the lag of DEE's, and above
  the crossover the decoded A-SPX tiles land as close to the source's energy as DEE's do
  (`tools/checks/score_ac4_encode.py --gold`).

### The compressor

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.5 gives the expander only: each slot of the low band times `2^(1/alpha)
  L^((1 - alpha)/alpha)`, `alpha` 0.65, with L the slot's level.
- **Reading:** the compressor multiplies each slot of the input's low band, below `sbx`, by `0.5
  L^(alpha - 1)`, L measured as the expander measures it on the input's own analysis: expanded, the
  slot's level is L again. The compressed slots, with nothing above `sbx`, are synthesised back by the
  decoder's synthesis bank, whose output runs `d_pcm` + 577 samples (929 at `frame_rate_index` 13)
  behind the analysis's input; the spectral frontend codes that output as far on, so that the decoder's
  analysis of what it decodes sees the compressed slots on the same axis.
- **Evidence:** Observation. A 1 kHz tone whose level steps by 30 dB steps by 0.65 of that, 19.5 dB,
  compressed (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_aspx.cpp`), and the encoder's companded streams decode within
  0.4 dB of their source's level.

### A sinusoid's group carries its energy

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 92 to 94, pp. 222 and 223: a group with `aspx_add_harmonic` set puts its
  sinusoid in its middle subband, at the level `scf_sig / (1 + scf_noise)` of the whole group, and scales
  the rest of the group to the noise.
- **Reading:** the encoder sends, for a group whose sinusoid an envelope carries, the energy per QMF
  subsample of the subband it stands for, not the group's mean, which would set the sinusoid a group's
  width low.
- **Evidence:** Text.

### A noise floor for a group whose patch holds nothing

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 94 and 95, pp. 223 and 224: a subband's noise level is `sqrt(scf_sig / (1 +
  scf_noise) * scf_noise)` whatever its patch holds, and its patch gain `sqrt(scf_sig / ((EPSILON + est_sig) *
  (1 + scf_noise)))`, with `EPSILON` 1.0, a QMF sample at full scale being 2^15.
- **Reading:** a patch of energy `est` per QMF subsample delivers `est / (1 + est)` of the share `1 / (1 + Q)`
  the envelope gives it (`Q` being `scf_noise`), so a group whose patch holds nothing is silent unless its noise
  `Q / (1 + Q)` or a sinusoid takes the energy. That is a sweep's group while the tone is above the crossover, the
  low band having nothing to copy. The encoder measures, per noise group and interval, the share of the input's
  energy that its patch delivers (the decoder's generator run on the input's low band at the modes chosen, a
  subband with a sinusoid or coded by the spectral frontend counting as delivered whole), and where it is under
  three quarters sends the noise floor at which `(share + Q) / (1 + Q)` reaches three quarters, if that is louder
  than the floor its tonality rule chose: `qscf_noise` 4, `Q` 4, for an empty patch. A group whose input is below
  the smallest signal envelope, 64 per QMF subsample, is silence and keeps its floor.
- **Evidence:** Streams and Observation. DEE's streams send a floor in every group: `qscf_noise` 7 to 17 on
  a 5.1.4 sweep, 7 in nine values of ten on music, where this encoder sent 29, the least, in 95 to 99 % of
  the sweep's values and 80 to 96 % of the music's. DEE's decoded tone lands 15 to 17 dB under the source's
  energy above 16.5 kHz; this encoder's landed 32 to 61 dB under it in 5.1 and 48 to 61 in 5.1.4, and lands 3
  to 4 dB under it with the floors (`tools/checks/score_ac4_encode.py --gold`, G1's sweeps). The sweep test in
  `tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_encoder.cpp` holds it.

### Balance values are sent halved

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 80 and 81 add each value of a balance channel twice (`delta` 2), and
  Pseudocode 84 reads the pair as a sum, `2^(qa/a + 1)` times 64, and a ratio, `2^(qb/a - PAN_OFFSET)`,
  with `PAN_OFFSET` 12. The balance F0 codebooks hold 0 to 24 at 1.5 dB and 0 to 12 at 3 dB.
- **Reading:** the sum's value is `a (log2(2^(qL/a) + 2^(qR/a)) - 1)`, and the value sent for the balance
  is half of `a (PAN_OFFSET + (qL - qR)/a)`, so that the F0 range is centred on equal channels; the noise
  floors likewise, without `a`. A balance channel's values are coded along time only from the last
  frame's balance values, which the doubling leaves even.
- **Evidence:** Readers. The encoder writes `aspx_balance` only when asked (`experimental=aspx-balance`),
  since no reader outside this project has read it from the encoder yet.

### A FIX end, a FIX start

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocode 76 starts a VARFIX or VARVAR interval where the last one stopped, which a
  FIXVAR or VARVAR interval's `aspx_var_bord_right` moves up to three A-SPX slots past its frame's end,
  and starts a FIXFIX or FIXVAR interval at the frame's start whatever the last did.
- **Reading:** an interval that ends with its frame is followed by one that starts with its frame, and
  one that runs on by one that starts where it stopped, so that the intervals tile the QMF slots.
- **Evidence:** Text.

### No time deltas into an I-frame

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.10.3: `aspx_sig_delta_dir` and `aspx_noise_delta_dir` code an envelope along time
  from the one before, which for an interval's first envelope is the last frame's.
- **Reading:** an I-frame's first signal and noise envelopes are coded along frequency, so that a decoder
  can start there; later envelopes may be coded along time.
- **Evidence:** Text.

## Table of contents and framing

### sequence_counter

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.2.2 counts `sequence_counter` from 1 to 1020 and round again; Part 1 Annex
  E.1 asks for 0 in the first frame of a file.
- **Reading:** 0 in the stream's first frame, then 1 to 1020 and round again from 1.
- **Evidence:** Readers.

### The CRC of a sync frame

- **Where:** Part 1 Annex G.4.2, p. 316, gives the generator polynomial and initial state of `crc_word`, and
  G.3.1, p. 315, places it after the raw frame; Part 2 Annex C points at that annex.
- **Reading:** the CRC-16 of polynomial 0x8005, from 0, over `frame_size` (two bytes, or five with the
  24-bit extension) and the raw frame.
- **Evidence:** Streams. The inspector's check of this coverage passes on every frame of DEE's 0xAC41
  streams, and the encoder-space harness computes it again from the text.

### Leftover bytes go in payload_base

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.2.10 and 4.3.3.2.11: `payload_base` places the first substream that many
  bytes after the table of contents.
- **Reading:** at a constant rate a frame's size is fixed, and a table of contents whose size moves with
  the substream sizes it carries can leave one to seven bytes over; `payload_base_minus1` takes them, as
  zero bytes between the table of contents and the presentation substream.
- **Evidence:** Readers.

### An MP4 track's channel count

- **Where:** Part 2 E.4, Table E.3, p. 223: `channelcount` of the `ac-4` sample entry "shall be ignored" on
  decoding and, on encoding, "should be set to the total number of audio output channels of the first
  presentation of that track".
- **Reading:** 2, for mono and for a multichannel first presentation as for stereo. The `dac4` says what
  the stream holds and a reader ignores this field, so the writer departs from the text's "should" for
  every presentation of other than two channels.
- **Evidence:** Text, for the two rules; nothing reads the value. FFmpeg's mov demuxer reads the track.

## The 5.X and 7.X elements

The readings phase E3 takes for 5.0 and 5.1, and for 7.0 and 7.1 as an experimental option. The writer
takes the decoder's reading of each of these, and the tests and the encoder-space harness hold the three
traces equal on every 5.X and 7.X stream they write:

- [The LFE's track is not numbered in Tables 180 and 182](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-lfes-track-is-not-numbered-in-tables-180-and-182):
  the LFE's `mono_data(1)` first, the channel data's tracks counted after it, and in the 7.X element C's
  `mono_data(0)` after the additional pair where `coding_config` 0 and 2 send it.
- [The 7.X element's additional channels](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-7x-elements-additional-channels): the
  encoder sends `b_use_sap_add_ch` 0, so its additional pair is its own two channels and the reading's
  matrix is not written.
- Table 213's name for 3/2/2's last pair (the misprints in `src/ac4/ERRATA.md`): Tfl and Tfr, as
  Tables 88 and 183 have them.

## A-CPL

The readings phase E4 takes for ASPX_ACPL_2 and ASPX_ACPL_3 in the 5.X element, and for ASPX_ACPL_1
there and A-CPL in the channel pair as experimental options. The writer takes the decoder's reading of
each of these:

- [When A-CPL's parameters apply](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#when-a-cpls-parameters-apply): a frame's
  parameters are estimated from the QMF slots of the A-SPX interval they share a control frame with,
  over a window centred on the last of them, where smooth interpolation reaches the new values.
- [ASPX_ACPL_1: the framing of the residuals](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#aspx_acpl_1-the-framing-of-the-residuals):
  the 5.X element's residuals share A and B's framing and layout group, and `max_sfb_master`, in
  n_side_bits of the largest transform length, stops them at `acpl_qmf_band`.
- [get_max_sfb() with b_dual_maxsfb](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#get_max_sfb-with-b_dual_maxsfb): the channel
  pair's ASPX_ACPL_1 sends one `sf_info()` with `b_dual_maxsfb`, the side stopped at `acpl_qmf_band` by
  its own `max_sfb_side`, and `chparam_info()` at `sap_mode` 0.

### The downmixes A-CPL codes

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 115 to 118, pp. 238 to 241, give the upmix; nothing gives the downmix a
  writer codes, or its level.
- **Reading:** the signals the upmix keeps whatever its parameters: the channel pair's x0 = (L + R) / 2,
  whose z0 + z1 is 2 x0; ASPX_ACPL_1's and 2's (L + Ls / sqrt 2) / 2 and its mirror, whose z0 + z1 /
  sqrt 2 is 2 x0 once Pseudocode 117 has scaled z1 by sqrt 2; and ASPX_ACPL_3's Lo and Ro, L + C /
  sqrt 2 + Ls / sqrt 2 and its mirror, over 1 + sqrt 2, which Pseudocode 118's input gain, 1 + 2
  sqrt 0.5, brings back to Lo and Ro. ASPX_ACPL_1's residuals are (L - Ls / sqrt 2) / 2 and its
  mirror, or the pair's (L - R) / 2: below `acpl_qmf_band` Pseudocode 116 takes x0 plus and minus the
  residual, which gives each pair back as it was.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's ASPX_ACPL_2 and ASPX_ACPL_3 streams decode with these downmixes, recovered
  from the output, 21 to 25 dB over the noise below the crossover on music (phase D5).

### ASPX_ACPL_3's gammas

- **Where:** Part 1 Pseudocodes 118 and 119, pp. 241 and 242: six gammas mix Lo and Ro into the three
  decorrelators' inputs, the two modules' groups and C. The text says what they do, not how a writer
  chooses them, and more than one choice rebuilds the same channels.
- **Reading:** gamma5 and gamma6 are the least squares prediction of C / sqrt 2 from Lo and Ro, per
  parameter band, and gamma1 = 1 - gamma5, gamma2 = -gamma6, gamma3 = -gamma5 and gamma4 = 1 - gamma6,
  counted in the quantiser's steps (ten fine steps or five coarse ones make 1), so that each module's
  group is Lo or Ro less the predicted centre, L + Ls / sqrt 2 or its mirror where the prediction is
  exact. beta3 gives the centre the energy the prediction leaves out.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's 5.1 streams at 96 kbps hold the four relations in 3,534 and 3,539 of the
  3,555 bands of music and film, and one relation is a step out in the rest.

## The immersive element

The readings phase E8 takes for 5.0.4 and 5.1.4 in SCPL, ASPX_SCPL and ASPX_ACPL_2, and for ASPX_ACPL_1,
ASPX_AJCC and 7.0.4 and 7.1.4 with the back pair as experimental options. The writer takes the decoder's
reading of each of these, and the tests hold the three traces equal on every immersive stream they write:

- [Table 19's track numbers are labels](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#table-19s-track-numbers-are-labels) and
  [Which channel holds which intermediate signal](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#which-channel-holds-which-intermediate-signal):
  `core_5ch_grouping` 0 with `2ch_mode` 0, as DEE writes it, and A'' to K'' coded where the channels they
  become are.
- [The framing of the immersive element's chparam_info()](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-framing-of-the-immersive-elements-chparam_info)
  and [Table 20's prediction gains](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#table-20s-prediction-gains): each coupled pair's
  difference is predicted from its sum band by band with Pseudocode 59's gain, and a pair and the pair
  predicted from it share a transform layout.
- [The core's top pair is Tsl and Tsr](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-cores-top-pair-is-tsl-and-tsr): the
  encoder's streams decode in core decoding to 5.X.2, each top pair's two channels in its side of it.

### Table 20's prediction

- **Where:** Part 2 5.2.3.2 step 5, p. 60, and 5.3, p. 63: S-CPL makes each coupled pair of its sum and
  difference; nothing says how a writer forms them, or what the four `chparam_info()` should send.
- **Reading:** each coupled pair's channels over sqrt 2 are coded as their sum and difference (M/S in every
  band), and the difference as its least-squares prediction's residual from the sum (`sap_mode` 3) where
  that costs fewer bits than the difference itself, else `sap_mode` 0. A 5.1.4 source's absent back pair
  makes each surround pair's difference its sum, which the prediction takes whole at a gain of 1.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's SCPL and ASPX_SCPL streams send `sap_mode` 3 there in nearly every frame
  (the decoder's entry). Readers: every channel's tone decodes on its own channel, and the decoder's trace
  is the encoder's.

### immersive_audio_indicator and the presence flags

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.2.3 and 6.3.2.7: `b_additional_data` and `add_data()` may carry
  `immersive_audio_indicator`; the presence flags describe the source's channels. Nothing says when a
  writer sets either.
- **Reading:** an immersive presentation sends one byte of additional data, `immersive_audio_indicator` 1
  and no advanced dialogue enhancement data, as DEE's 5.1.4 streams do; the presence flags are the
  source's: `b_4_back_channels_present` only with the back pair, the centre, both top pairs.
- **Evidence:** Streams: DEE's 5.1.4 streams carry both so.

### The height downmix

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.9.2 to 6.2.9.10: `custom_dmx_data()` sends per output
  configuration where the top channels go and at what gain; DEE's `height_dmx_mode` names three routes.
- **Reading:** `HeightDownmix::kFront` sends both top pairs to L and R, `kSurround` both to Ls and Rs, and
  `kFrontAndSurround` the top front pair to L and R and the top back pair to Ls and Rs, each at the one
  gain (Table 129), for `out_ch_config` 0 (5.X.0), in I-frames alone, as DEE's streams carry its three
  modes; 7.0.4 and 7.1.4 add the back pair's `gain_b_code`.
- **Evidence:** Streams: G0's and G1's height downmix legs; the decoder renders the encoder's streams to
  each route at its gain (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_immersive.cpp`, `tools/checks/gain_ac4_decode.py`).

### A-JCC's parameters

- **Where:** Part 2 5.6, pp. 68 to 78, gives A-JCC's upmix; nothing gives the core a writer codes or how it
  chooses the parameters. DEE's 5.1.4 streams never use ASPX_AJCC.
- **Reading:** `ajcc_core_mode` 0. The core is each side's front, L + Tfl / sqrt 2, and back, (Ls + Lb +
  Tbl) / sqrt 2, over Pseudocode 8's input gain 2 + 1 / sqrt 2, and C over the same, so that the upmix
  keeps each column's sum. Per A-CPL parameter band, the front module's alpha and beta are estimated as the
  A-CPL modules' are; the back module's dry values are the least-squares shares of the column's sum, and
  its wet values those whose decorrelated signals give what the quantised shares leave its covariance.
- **Evidence:** Readers: one tone per channel decodes on its own channel in full decoding, and in core
  decoding at Pseudocode 14's gains (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_immersive.cpp`).

## Objects

The writer takes the decoder's readings of [A-JOC](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#a-joc) and of [object audio
metadata and the ISF renderer](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#object-audio-metadata-and-the-isf-renderer) by
running the decoder's own reconstruction (`src/ac4core`'s `ajoc::Reconstruction`) on the parameters it
weighs: the ramp's counter, the decorrelation input matrix by subband, H'_M by object. Objects take the
output level's gain and no DRC, so an object presentation refuses DRC gains.

### A-JOC's downmix

- **Where:** Part 2 p. 161: the standard does not specify the downmix; 5.7 gives the upmix alone, and
  4.8.3.4.2 a computed downmix's signals their own metadata for core decoding.
- **Reading:** a computed downmix sums the objects in groups: the full-band objects in the order of their
  azimuth about the room's centre as they start, from the back left through the front to the back right,
  cut into as many runs as there are downmix signals, as equal as can be. The groups stay for the stream,
  so that each A-JOC coefficient keeps its meaning from frame to frame. Each signal's metadata is one block
  a frame at the energy-weighted centre of its group over the frame, ramped over the frame. A static 5.X
  bed pans each object between the front row (L, C, R) and the back row (Ls, Rs) by the sine and cosine of
  a quarter turn of Y, and along each row the same way by X; Z is left out, and the LFE object goes to the
  LFE. The pans move linearly across each 32 samples from the object's positions at their ends. A-JOC's
  input i reads the element's full-band track that Pseudocode 14a gives it, so the encoder puts downmix
  signal i there.
- **Evidence:** Readers: each object of a computed downmix, a static 5.1 bed and one with bed objects
  decodes at 40 to 74 dB SNR against the object given, and core decoding gives each downmix signal at its
  group's centre (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_objects.cpp`). Chromium's `ac4-ajoc.ac4` has a computed downmix
  of ten signals.

### A-JOC's parameters

- **Where:** Part 2 5.7.3, pp. 83 to 91, gives the reconstruction; nothing gives how a writer chooses the
  matrices.
- **Reading:** one data point a frame at its first slot, over the frame's A-SPX interval as A-CPL's
  parameters are. The candidates are the last frame's values again; the least-squares fit of each object
  from the downmix per parameter band over the frame, as a ramp of 32 slots from the last frame's matrix
  takes it there, and as a step at the second slot; and the fit over the 32 slots centred on the frame's
  end. Each is quantised within Tables 29 to 32's ranges, its smallest coefficients dropped in turn where
  it takes more than 30 per cent of the frame, run through the reconstruction from the state the frames
  sent leave it in, and the one whose objects come closest to the objects given is sent. With
  decorrelators, object o takes decorrelator o mod `ajoc_num_decorr`, whose wet coefficient gives it the
  energy the dry matrix leaves out. Each set goes along frequency, or along time where that takes fewer
  bits outside I-frames, each object sparse where that takes fewer, and not present where every value is
  0. `ajoc_dmx_de_data()` names no dialogue objects.
- **Evidence:** Readers (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_objects.cpp`).

### When an object's metadata changes

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.9.3 and 5.9.2: a block's update takes effect at `sample_offset` + 32
  `block_offset_factor` into its codec frame, counted with the decoder's delay.
- **Reading:** an update at input sample n is at sample n + the encoder's delay of the signal's axis, and
  goes in the frame that codes that sample, in the block of its 32-sample step, with `oa_sample_offset` 0;
  the decoder reports it at n + `delay_samples()` + `decoder_delay_samples()`, to within 32 samples. A
  frame sends a block at each step an update starts in, at most seven, the latest kept, each object's
  properties those in force at the step's end; an I-frame's first block sends every object whole
  (`b_no_delta`). Otherwise a block reuses an object's basic information and each render group that has
  not changed, and sends the position as a difference where each coordinate's is -4 to 3.
  `add_per_object_md()` is sent in every block of an object with trim or headphone data, since each block
  sets them afresh. The ramp is Table 94's code, Table 95's entry or `ramp_duration`, at most 2 047 samples.
- **Evidence:** Readers: each update of a moving object decodes at its sample, in A-JOC and direct-coded
  streams (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_objects.cpp`).

### The screen factor and the depth exponent

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.8.7, `object_render_info()`, pp. 144 and 145, Table 105's `group_other_mask` and
  6.3.9.8.17 and 6.3.9.8.18, p. 195: bit 1 of `group_other_mask` sends `object_screen_factor_code` (3 bits) and
  `object_depth_factor` (2 bits) together, the factor is printed `object_screen_factor_code+1/8`, and "If the
  object_screen_factor_code element is not present, object_screen_factor shall be 0".
- **Reading:** the factor is (code + 1) / 8, from 1/8 to 1, as the decoder reads it (`apply_other()` in
  `src/ac4/src/decoder/pcm/objects.cpp`), so the group has no code for a factor of 0: a factor of 0 is the group's
  absence, which also leaves the depth exponent at 1 ([the decoder's reading](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#object-audio-metadata)).
  The encoder sends the group for an object whose factor is above 0 or whose exponent is not 1. An exponent
  other than 1 with a factor of 0 has no code. The encoder refuses such an object at configuration, naming the
  reason, and such properties in a metadata update as invalid input; it used to send a factor of 1/8, which
  the decoder then reported. A factor between 0 and 1/16 still rounds to 1/8, the smallest the group holds.
- **Evidence:** Text; readers: an exponent of each of Table 107's codes with its factor reads back as given
  (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_objects.cpp`), and the C API answers a configuration and an update with its two
  encoder statuses (`tests/capi/test_capi_ac4_arguments.cpp`).

### md_compat for objects

- **Where:** Part 2 Table 55, p. 157: md_compat 0 to 3 allow 2, 6, 9 and 11 tracks; the decoder's reading
  of the table for A-JOC is 17 objects and an LFE at md_compat 3 ([The objects oamd_dyndata_multi()
  lists](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-objects-oamd_dyndata_multi-lists)).
- **Reading:** an A-JOC presentation's tracks are its downmix signals, and it takes md_compat 3 at the
  least, 7 above 17 objects; a direct-coded one's tracks are its full-band objects, as a channel-based
  presentation's are its channels.
- **Evidence:** Text. Chromium's stream of ten downmix signals and seventeen objects is one DEE wrote.

### Direct-coded objects

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.1.11 and 6.2.3.2: `audio_data_objs(n_objects, b_lfe)` codes the objects in the
  element `objs_to_channel_mode()` names, one, two, three or five, the LFE's `mono_data(1)` before it.
- **Reading:** the dynamic objects in their order, five a substream while five are left, then three, two or
  one; the LFE object in the first substream. The group's OAMD substream lists each substream's objects,
  the LFE first, then the element's channels in L, R, C, Ls, Rs order. Bed objects are refused here.
- **Evidence:** Readers (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_objects.cpp`).

## The MP4 sample entry's dac4

`iclforge::ac4::build_dac4()` in `src/ac4` writes Annex E.6's `ac4_dsi_v1()` from a table of contents, for the
encoder's MP4 output and for `forge mp4` alike. Every presentation of a bitstream_version 2 table of
contents is derived whole (Annex E.10 and E.11): a single substream group, each configuration of Table
53, channel-coded, A-JOC and direct-coded object groups, and an alternative presentation's name and
targets where the writer gives them (an encoder knows them; `forge mp4` reads them with the decoder);
what it cannot derive whole it refuses, and `iclforge::ac4::dac4_refusal()` says why. These are the readings it
takes. Where the evidence is DEE's MP4 muxer, the box it writes is the box `build_dac4()` writes, byte for
byte (`tests/ac4/core/test_ac4.cpp`, `tools/checks/check_ac4_encode_readers.py`): for the committed DEE
streams and the encoder's single-presentation streams (but for the 3/2/2 layout's top front pair, below),
and for Chromium's A-JOC stream and DASH-IF's 5.1 test vectors, whose program identifier it copies from
the table of contents. The muxer refuses a stream of more than one presentation and does not finish one
of an alternative presentation; MediaInfo's trace of the encoder's presentation streams' boxes reads
every configuration's substream groups as written.

### Pseudocode E.3 leaves channel groups out

- **Where:** Part 2 E.10.3, pp. 235 and 236, against Table A.27, p. 214.
- **Text:** Pseudocode E.3 sets no LFE group for any channel mode, and for `pres_ch_mode` 11 and up
  sets neither L/R nor Ls/Rs, and sets group 2 where its comment says C, which Table A.27 numbers 1.
  It never sets group 16, Lscr/Rscr: its condition is `if (0)`, "not present in any supported channel
  configuration", where Table A.27 gives the pair to the 9.X layouts, `pres_ch_mode` 13 and 14. For
  22.2 it sets group 7, Tsl/Tsr, only where `pres_top_channel_pairs` is 1, where Table A.27 has them in
  22.2 whatever the top pairs.
- **Reading:** the groups Table A.27 gives each mode: group 6 wherever the mode has an LFE (5.1, the
  7.1 modes, 7.1.4, 9.1.4 and 22.2), and for 11 and up L/R, Ls/Rs, C where `b_pres_centre_present`,
  Lb/Rb where `b_pres_4_back_channels_present` and the top pairs `pres_top_channel_pairs` names;
  Lscr/Rscr for 9.0.4 and 9.1.4, and Tsl/Tsr for 22.2. The same for `dsi_substream_channel_groups[]`.
- **Evidence:** Streams, for 5.1 and 5.1.4: DEE's muxer sets groups 0, 1, 2 and 6 for 5.1, and 0, 1, 2,
  4, 5 and 6 for its 5.1.4. Text for the 9.X layouts and 22.2, which no stream here carries.

### The 3/2/2 layout's top front pair

- **Where:** Part 2 Table A.27, p. 214, and Pseudocode E.3, pp. 235 and 236.
- **Text:** both give the 7.X element's 3/2/2 modes (`pres_ch_mode` 9 and 10) group 4, Tfl and Tfr.
- **Reading:** group 4, as printed, in `presentation_v1_channel_groups[]` and
  `dsi_substream_channel_groups[]`.
- **Evidence:** Text, which both places agree on, against two readers. Given the encoder's 3/2/2
  streams (an experimental layout), DEE's muxer writes groups 0, 1 and 2, and 6 for 7.1, and none for
  the pair, while it writes the 3/4/0 and 5/2/0 modes' pairs (groups 3 and 17) as printed.
  MediaInfo's trace names the channel mode 7.1 3/2/2.1, and its summary counts seven channels, the
  pair as Tfc. DEE's encoder writes no 7.X layout, so neither reader has a stream of its own maker's
  to read there. `tools/checks/check_ac4_encode_readers.py` reports the muxer's box as differing in
  group 4 alone.

### b_presentation_core_differs

- **Where:** Part 2 Table E.11, p. 233.
- **Text:** true "if the pres_ch_mode_core according to pseudocode 26 has a value of -1; or in any
  ac4_substream_group_info() of the presentation: b_channel_coded is false and b_ajoc is true".
- **Reading:** true where `pres_ch_mode_core` is not -1, as `b_presentation_core_channel_coded`'s rule,
  false where it is -1, implies; for channel-coded substreams, the immersive modes 11 to 14 (Table 71),
  and for an A-JOC substream a static downmix's 5.0 or 5.1, with Table E.14's code for the core. An A-JOC
  group alone does not set it: an adaptive downmix has no core (Pseudocode 26).
- **Evidence:** Streams. DEE's muxer writes 0 for 2.0 and 5.1, 1 with the 5.1.2 core for its 5.1.4, and 0
  for Chromium's A-JOC stream, whose one A-JOC substream has an adaptive downmix of ten signals.

### The bit rate and the indicators

- **Where:** Part 2 Table E.7 and E.10.1.
- **Reading:** `bit_rate_mode` follows the table of contents' `wait_frames` as Table E.7 says (1 where it
  is 0, 2 where it is 1 to 6, 3 otherwise, `b_wait_frames` 0 included); `bit_rate` is written as 0,
  unknown, with `bit_rate_precision` 0xFFFFFFFF. A presentation sends `b_presentation_bitrate_info`
  where every substream of its substream groups sends `b_bitrate_info`, as Table E.11 asks, and a
  presentation of configuration 6, which has no substream to send one, sends none. `de_indicator` and
  `immersive_audio_indicator` are facts of the substreams, which a table of contents does not carry: the
  encoder gives them, whether a substream sends dialogue enhancement and 0, and a DSI built from a
  stream's table of contents alone leaves out the closing byte that holds them, as its `pres_bytes`
  allows.
- **Evidence:** Streams, for the encoder's output: DEE's muxer writes the same. For DEE's streams it
  writes mode 2 and sets `de_indicator`, which `forge mp4` cannot see from the table of contents. Text
  for configuration 6.

### A presentation's channel mode, core and channel groups

- **Where:** Part 2 E.10.2, p. 232: `dsi_presentation_ch_mode` and `pres_b_4_back_channels_present`,
  `pres_top_channel_pairs` and the channel groups come from Pseudocode 25 and clauses 6.3.3.1.29 to
  6.3.3.1.30; E.10.3 from `b_pres_centre_present` too (6.3.3.1.29a).
- **Reading:** the decoder's ([presentation_config 1 and 4 read more specifiers than
  n_substream_groups](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#presentation_config-1-and-4-read-more-specifiers-than-n_substream_groups)
  and [The presentation substream](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-presentation-substream)): every substream of
  every group the specifiers name, a group named twice once, `superset()` by the channels each mode holds,
  and `b_pres_centre_present` the disjunction of the substreams' `b_centre_present`, where they send
  one. A group the table of contents does not carry (`b_multi_pid`) cannot be described, and is refused.
  Each group gets its own `ac4_substream_group_dsi()` in its specifiers' order, a group named twice
  twice.
- **Evidence:** Text; MediaInfo reads the encoder's presentation streams' boxes as written.

### An A-JOC substream's objects

- **Where:** Part 2 Table E.15, p. 238: `b_substream_contains_bed_objects` and its siblings of an A-JOC
  substream "match the values transmitted in ac4_substream_info_ajoc", which transmits the upmix's
  `bed_dyn_obj_assignment()` (6.2.1.10), whose syntax lists bed and ISF objects and no dynamic ones.
- **Reading:** the upmix holds bed objects where the assignment lists one, ISF objects likewise, and
  dynamic objects where it lists fewer objects than `n_fullband_upmix_signals`, all of them where
  `b_dyn_objects_only` is set. A direct-coded object substream holds what its `b_dynamic_objects`,
  `b_bed_objects` and `b_isf` say, a substream continuing a bed or an ISF set included. The encoder's
  A-JOC substreams send the downmix's signals as dynamic objects only, and the upmix's bed objects first,
  listed by `nonstd_bed_channel_assignment` (`b_channel_assignment_flags_present` 0), with its dynamic
  objects after them.
- **Evidence:** Streams, for the dynamic case: DEE's muxer writes 0, 1 and 0 for Chromium's A-JOC
  stream, whose upmix of seventeen signals is dynamic objects only. Readers for the encoder's bed objects,
  which decode as the bed objects they were given (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_objects.cpp`). Text for the
  rest.

### An alternative presentation's dac4

- **Where:** Part 2 E.12, pp. 239 and 240: `alternative_info()` carries `name_len` in 16 bits and the
  name, `n_targets` ("the value of n_targets_minus1 + 1") in 5 bits, and for each target
  `target_md_compat` in 3 bits and `target_device_category` in 8 bits, "the respective field defined in
  clause 6.3.3.1.7", which the presentation substream sends as four Booleans (Table 67) with four more
  bits behind `b_tdc_extension`.
- **Reading:** the name's bytes without the 0 the presentation substream closes a whole name with, and
  `name_len` counting them; `n_targets` the number of targets; `target_device_category` Table 67's four
  Booleans, index 0 first, in its upper four bits and the extension's four in the lower, 0 where
  `b_tdc_extension` is 0. The table of contents does not carry them, so `build_dac4()` refuses an
  alternative presentation whose writer has not given them.
- **Evidence:** Text. MediaInfo reads the name and the first target as written, then a second target:
  it takes `n_targets` for `n_targets_minus1`. DEE's muxer, given the encoder's stream of one alternative
  presentation, writes nothing in 60 seconds and has to be stopped, so it settles nothing here.

## Manifests and CMAF tracks

`forge fmp4`, and `record` and `live` with `container=fmp4`, fragment AC-4 into a CMAF track (Part 2
Annex H) with an HLS playlist and a DASH MPD (Annex G). `src/ac4` reads what the manifests say off the
table of contents (`iclforge::ac4::signalled_presentation()`, `iclforge::ac4::rfc6381_codec_string()`,
`iclforge::ac4::dash_channel_configuration()`, `iclforge::ac4::dash_supplemental_properties()`,
`iclforge::ac4::presentation_channel_count()`), and `src/mp4` writes the track, each fragment starting at a sync
sample (E.3) and listing each sample's flags where a fragment holds a frame that is not an I-frame
(E.2). These are the readings.

### The presentation a manifest describes

- **Where:** Part 2 G.2.3, p. 247: "AdaptationSet elements should signal the properties of the AC-4
  presentation with the widest compatibility"; E.13, p. 240, takes the codecs parameter's
  `presentation_version` and `md_compat` "for the presentation".
- **Text:** neither clause says what makes one presentation more widely compatible than another, or
  which presentation E.13 means.
- **Reading:** the lowest `md_compat` (Table 55, the level a decoder needs), among the presentations
  that carry audio and that the stream does not disable, the first in the table of contents where
  several share it; the first presentation where none carries audio. The codecs parameter, the channel
  configuration, the frame rate and pre-virtualized descriptors and HLS's channel count all describe
  this one. It is the first presentation for every stream DEE writes and for every stream of one
  presentation, which is what `rfc6381_codec_string()` took before.
- **Evidence:** Text. No player here reads an AC-4 manifest.

### The "Dolby:2015" channel configuration's bit order

- **Where:** Part 2 G.3.3.2, p. 248, and Table G.1, p. 249.
- **Text:** "bit n in {0 ... 17} is set to ac4_dsi_v1/presentation_channel_group[17 - n]", where
  Pseudocode E.3 indexes that array by Table A.27's channel group, which would put L/R (group 0) at bit
  17. The clause's Example 1 gives 5.1.2 (groups 0, 1, 2, 6 and 7) as `0000C7`, Example 2 object audio
  as `800000`, and every row of Table G.1 has group g at bit g (stereo `000001`, mono `000002`, 5.1
  `000047`).
- **Reading:** group g at bit g, as both examples and the table have it: the index in "[17 - n]" is the
  order the array's elements are sent in, the first being group 17 (E.10.2). Bit 23 is set for object
  audio, and Table G.1's MPEG value is signalled instead wherever the groups match a row, as G.3.3.1
  prefers.
- **Evidence:** The clause's two examples and Table G.1's 27 rows agree with each other and not with the
  sentence.

### A single-stream track's brands

- **Where:** Part 2 H.4, Table H.1, p. 253: 'ca4m' for the AC-4 CMAF main profile (H.1.2.1, H.1.2.2,
  H.3), 'ca4s' for the single-stream profile (H.1.2.1, H.1.2.3, H.3), "a subprofile of the AC-4 CMAF
  main profile".
- **Reading:** a track holding every substream group its presentations name, none of them with
  `b_multi_pid` (H.1.2.3), lists both brands after 'cmfc': it keeps the single-stream profile, and
  H.1.2.2's rules apply only where a presentation's groups are spread over several tracks, so it keeps
  the main profile too, which H.4 makes the default. A stream with `b_multi_pid` is refused, since one
  track cannot hold its other groups.
- **Evidence:** Text.

## The presentation substream

### dialnorm_bits

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.12.2.1: the dialogue level in 0.25 dB steps from 0 to -31.75 dBFS.
- **Reading:** `dialnorm_bits` is the level's magnitude over 0.25, rounded; `forge ac4-encode`'s
  `dialnorm=` takes it in steps of 0.25 dB from 0 to 31.75, as the field is coded.
- **Evidence:** Readers.

### A drc_frame() with no DRC

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.2.3: `drc_metadata_size_value` counts the bits of `drc_frame()`.
- **Reading:** a frame that sends no DRC writes `drc_frame()` as `b_drc_present` 0 alone, and a size of
  one bit; `tools_metadata_size` of the audio substream's `metadata()` is likewise one bit,
  `b_de_data_present` 0.
- **Evidence:** Readers: both readers hold these sizes to the bits read.

### Dialogue enhancement and DRC in the frame's metadata

The writer takes the decoder's reading of each of these (phase E5):

- [de_data() predicts from the wrong channel](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#de_data-predicts-from-the-wrong-channel):
  a channel after the first is sent along its own bands in an I-frame.
- [Dialogue enhancement and DRC configuration across I-frames](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#dialogue-enhancement-and-drc-configuration-across-i-frames):
  `de_config()` and `drc_config()` go in I-frames, and a frame between them sends `b_de_config_flag` 0,
  and `b_drc_present` 0 unless a mode sends gains.
- [drc_repeat_id copies a whole mode](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#drc_repeat_id-copies-a-whole-mode): a repeat of
  a mode that sends gains sends a gainset in `drc_data()` too, that mode's gains again.
- [drc_gains() is a brace short](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#drc_gains-is-a-brace-short) and
  [DRC's units](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#drcs-units): gains in whole dB2, frequency-differential along the
  first subframe's bands and time-differential along each band's subframes.
- [When dialogue enhancement's, DRC's and the downmix's values apply](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#when-dialogue-enhancements-drcs-and-the-downmixs-values-apply):
  a frame's dialogue enhancement parameters and DRC gains are computed on the block its control data
  meets (above, "Where the encoder's QMF slots fall").

### drc_gainset_size counts drc_version

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.13.5.1, p. 130 ("the size in bits of the following drc_gains element"), against
  Table 74, p. 67 (`bits_left = drc_gainset_size - 2 - used_bits`).
- **Reading:** the formula's: the size counts `drc_version`'s two bits and `drc_gains()`, which is what
  a reader skipping a gainset by its size needs. The decoder accepts either reading at `drc_version` 0
  ([drc_gainset_size does and does not count drc_version](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#drc_gainset_size-does-and-does-not-count-drc_version)).
- **Evidence:** Readers. Transmitted gains are experimental (`experimental=drc-gains-0` to
  `drc-gains-3`, one for each DRC mode): no stream DEE writes sends them.

## Presentations

The table of contents of several presentations and their mixing fields (`src/ac4/src/encoder/frame/toc_writer.cpp`
and `metadata.cpp`), which phase D7's test multiplexer writes, and the encoder's presentations of several
substreams (`src/ac4/src/encoder/encoder.cpp`), phase E6's. The writer takes the decoder's reading of each of
these:

- [presentation_config 1 and 4 read more specifiers than n_substream_groups](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#presentation_config-1-and-4-read-more-specifiers-than-n_substream_groups)
  and [Substream group gains](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#substream-group-gains): every specifier the
  configuration reads, and `sg_gain` for n_substream_groups groups as 6.2.1.3 assigns it: none for
  configuration 1, the main and associated groups' for configuration 4.
- [The dialogue's gain and pans](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-dialogues-gain-and-pans) and
  [Panning](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#panning): `dialog_max_gain` for a g_dialog_max of (1 + `dialog_max_gain`)
  x 3 dB, and pans in 1.5 degree steps clockwise from the front, 330 degrees L and 30 degrees R.
- [The main audio's and the dialogue's scaling with associated audio](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-main-audios-and-the-dialogues-scaling-with-associated-audio):
  `scale_main`, `scale_main_centre` and `scale_main_front` at -0.3 dB a step, 255 for silence.
- [The hybrid dialogue enhancement's waveform](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-hybrid-dialogue-enhancements-waveform):
  a hybrid method's `de_signal_contribution` sets the waveform's share, alpha_c = x / 31, of the gain,
  and the dialogue enhancement substream's channels are d_c in that entry's order (below, "The hybrid
  methods' waveform").
- [Which presentations can be selected](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#which-presentations-can-be-selected): each
  presentation's `md_compat` is the least its tracks allow (below, "Tracks for md_compat"), so that a
  decoder of that level can select it; a caller may set a higher one, and 7 is selected only by a
  decoder told its level is 7.
- [The order of the preferences](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-order-of-the-preferences): a presentation's
  language is its dialogue substream's, else its main or music and effects substream's. Each substream's
  language goes in its own group's `content_type()`, so an associated substream's tag, which may be one
  of Table 92's codes such as `qad`, never gives a presentation its language.
- [b_associated and b_dialog are parameters at sus_ver 0](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#b_associated-and-b_dialog-are-parameters-at-sus_ver-0):
  at sus_ver 1 the writer sends `b_dialog` for a substream that is the dialogue of a presentation or is
  classified as dialogue, with its mixing values, in every frame.
- [Levelling before the mix](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#levelling-before-the-mix): a version 1 presentation
  carries one dialnorm, in its presentation substream, and levels nothing, so each presentation substream
  sends the dialnorm its substreams share: the presentation's own, else the stream's.
- [oamd_dyndata_single() in metadata() of a channel-coded substream](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#oamd_dyndata_single-in-metadata-of-a-channel-coded-substream):
  a channel-coded substream sends none, so one substream serves an alternative presentation and others
  alike.
- [The end of an EMDF payload list](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-end-of-an-emdf-payload-list): each list ends
  with an `emdf_payload_id` of 0 and the alignment, and nothing between.
- [The presentation substream](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#the-presentation-substream): `superset(0, 1)` is 1,
  so stereo main audio with mono dialogue or associated audio is a stereo presentation, and the fields
  that follow `pres_ch_mode`, `custom_dmx_data()` and `loud_corr()`, follow the superset.

### Tracks for md_compat

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.2.2.3 and Table 55, p. 157: md_compat 0 to 3 allow 2, 6, 9 and 11 tracks, "the
  total number of audio objects and channels in all substreams contributing to the presentation, with the
  exception of LFE channels that have the b_lfe flag set in mono_data() structure", and 7 is
  "Unrestricted".
- **Reading:** a presentation's tracks are the channels of every substream it names but the LFE, its
  dialogue enhancement substream's among them, whose waveform joins the output (Part 1 5.7.8.9). The
  writer sends the least level that holds them, 7 above 11 tracks, and refuses a level set below it or in
  4 to 6. One substream alone is level 0 in mono and stereo, 1 in 5.X and 2 in 7.X.
- **Evidence:** Streams. DEE's streams carry level 0 in stereo, 1 in 5.1 and 2 in 5.1.4, whose nine
  tracks the reading counts, each with `presentation_id` 0 on its one presentation, as the encoder's
  single presentation now has (phases E1 to E5 wrote level 0 and no `presentation_id`). MediaInfo lists
  each committed presentation's level as configured, and the decoder selects each at it
  (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_presentations.cpp`).

### A presentation_id for every presentation that carries audio

- **Where:** Part 2 Annex H.1.2.1, p. 250: in an AC-4 CMAF track of several presentations "each
  presentation shall have a unique presentation_id", and "for every presentation presentation_id shall be
  present in every AC-4 sample"; 6.2.1.3, p. 114, reads no `b_presentation_id` for `presentation_config`
  6.
- **Reading:** every presentation of configurations 0 to 5, and every presentation of one substream
  group, carries a `presentation_id` in every frame, no two the same; a configuration 6 presentation,
  EMDF payloads alone, has no field for one. The writer takes configuration 6 as Part 2's syntax has it,
  and an MP4 that is not fragmented carries it (Annex E.10). A CMAF track cannot, since "every
  presentation" includes it: `iclforge::ac4::cmaf_refusal()` refuses a stream with one, and `forge fmp4` with it
  (phase E7). A writer that wants a CMAF track carries the payloads in a presentation that plays audio,
  in the EMDF payloads substream its `emdf_info()` names.
- **Evidence:** Text. DEE's muxer, given the encoder's EMDF stream, warns that its second presentation "is
  missing a presentation_id", and refuses the stream, as it refuses every stream of more than one
  presentation.

### An alternative presentation's name

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.2.3, p. 123, and 6.3.3.1.1 to 6.3.3.1.4, p. 167: `name_len` in five bits, or 32
  bytes where `b_length` is 0; a name whose last byte is 0 is whole, and one whose last byte is not is a
  chunk of a name serialized over several frames, the last chunk counting them.
- **Reading:** a name of at most 31 bytes of UTF-8, none of them 0, sent whole in every frame: its bytes
  and a 0, with `name_len` counting the 0 where that is below 32, and the 32-byte form for a name of 31
  bytes. A longer name, which only the chunked form holds, is refused.
- **Evidence:** Readers. MediaInfo frames the name where the writer put it, showing its bytes as data,
  and the decoder's and the Python parser's traces read the name and the 0.

### An alternative presentation's target

- **Where:** Part 2 6.2.2.3, pp. 123 and 124, and 6.3.3.1.5 to 6.3.3.1.15, pp. 167 and 168: one target
  or more, each with a `target_level` "similar to the md_compat element", Table 67's four device
  categories, an optional ducking depth and loudness correction, and for each substream `b_active` and
  `alt_data_set_index`, which picks one of the alternative object metadata sets an object substream's
  `oamd_dyndata_single()` carries; 4.8.2, p. 40: alternative presentations apply "alternative metadata
  to the selected substreams". Nothing says what a decoder does with a target.
- **Reading:** a channel-coded substream has no alternative metadata sets, so an alternative presentation
  of channel-coded substreams carries its name and one target: the presentation's `md_compat`, every
  device category, no ducking depth or loudness correction, and every substream active with
  `alt_data_set_index` 0, none.
- **Evidence:** Text; Readers.

### 3.0 substreams

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.7.1, p. 77: "The 3.0 channel mode shall only be used" for "coding of the
  enhancement signal for the Dialogue Enhancement (DE) feature" and for "coding of the dialogue in a
  music and effects + dialogue presentation".
- **Reading:** a 3.0 substream is a hybrid method's dialogue enhancement substream, or the dialogue of a
  configuration 0 or 3 presentation, or of a configuration 5 one whose main group is classified music and
  effects. A presentation of one substream group, which gives it no other role, may also play it alone,
  so long as a music and effects presentation carries it as dialogue. 3.0 as main or associated audio, or
  as dialogue beside a complete main, is refused. The 3.0 element is experimental
  (`experimental=three-zero`): no DEE stream has one.
- **Evidence:** Readers. The decoder and the Python parser read the committed 3.0 stream
  (`tests/golden/ac4/presentations/encoder-three-zero.ac4`) as the encoder wrote it, MediaInfo lists
  it as configured, and the decoder mixes the dialogue channel to channel into the music and effects'
  L, R and C.

### The hybrid methods' waveform

- **Where:** Part 1 5.7.8.9, pp. 253 and 254: the hybrid methods add the waveform d_c to the output; the
  text gives the decoder's equations and says nothing of the signal a writer puts in d_c.
- **Reading:** d_c is the dialogue the parameters raise. With the channel independent method, the
  dialogue of each processed channel, from the stem or from the channels marked as dialogue, one channel
  each in L, R, C order; with the Mid, L's and R's dialogue summed, which 1/2 (1, 1) halves into each;
  with the cross-channel method, the dialogue projected on r, its panning, which the writer estimates from
  the dialogue's energy in each channel, averaged with a leak whose time constant is half a second. The
  waveform's share alpha_c is the caller's (`DialogueConfig::waveform_share`), sent as
  `de_signal_contribution`.
- **Evidence:** Text; each method's output measures to 0.01 dB against the main and the waveform decoded
  alone, as the decoder's reading combines them (`tests/ac4/encoder/test_ac4enc_presentations.cpp`).

### Mixing values across I-frames

- **Where:** Part 1 6.2.16.0, p. 268: the mixing metadata "are not necessarily sent with each frame, and
  not necessarily with each I-frame, although this is encouraged", and "remain valid until new ones are
  transmitted"; Part 2 6.3.3.1.22 to 6.3.3.1.24, p. 170: `b_keep` repeats the last group gains; 6.3.2.11.2,
  p. 166: `b_pres_ndot` says "whether a presentation substream can be decoded independently from
  preceding frames".
- **Reading:** an I-frame's presentation substream sends every mixing value the presentation is
  configured with, and sets `b_pres_ndot`; a frame between I-frames keeps the group gains with `b_keep`,
  sends no associated audio's values, which hold, and clears `b_pres_ndot`. A dialogue substream's values
  (`b_dialog`) go in every frame, since the decoder's reading sets g_dialog_max to 0 dB at an I-frame
  that does not send them.
- **Evidence:** Readers; every mix of the committed streams measures its configured gains.

### The substreams' order

- **Where:** Part 1 4.2.3.11, p. 33, and 4.3.3.12.4, p. 81: `substream_index_table()` gives the
  substreams' sizes in the order the frame carries them; Part 2 4.8.2, p. 40: a presentation finds its
  substreams by each info element's `substream_index`. Nothing orders the presentation, audio and EMDF
  payload substreams.
- **Reading:** the presentation substreams first, in the presentations' order, then the audio
  substreams, in the groups' order, then the EMDF payload substreams.
- **Evidence:** Streams. librempeg takes the substream after the presentation substreams as a
  presentation's first group's audio: with an EMDF payload substream there, it refused the frame ("invalid
  audio_size"). MediaInfo reads either order.

### EMDF

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.6.1 and 4.3.3.6.2, p. 77: `emdf_version` "shall be set to 0", and the text
  "defines no semantics" for `key_id`; Part 2 6.2.1.3, p. 114: a presentation names an EMDF payloads
  substream in its `emdf_info()`, and configuration 6 in `b_add_emdf_substreams`' list.
- **Reading:** `emdf_version` 0 and `key_id` 0, with no protection bytes. A presentation's payloads go in
  an EMDF payloads substream of their own that its `emdf_info()` names, configuration 6's in one its list
  names, and a substream's in its `metadata()` (`b_emdf_payloads_substream`); each in every frame, as the
  caller gives them.
- **Evidence:** Readers. MediaInfo frames the EMDF payloads substream without detailing it, and names a
  substream's payloads `umd_payload`.

### DRC gains for a presentation of several substreams

- **Where:** Part 1 6.2.13, p. 268: the decoder's DRC side chain is the signal before dialogue
  enhancement. Nothing says what signal a writer computes transmitted gains (`drc_gains()`) from where a
  presentation mixes several substreams.
- **Reading:** the presentation's main or music and effects substream's input alone. The decoder's side
  chain is the mix of the substreams ([Where the substreams are mixed](../ac4dec/ERRATA.md#where-the-substreams-are-mixed)),
  so these gains leave the dialogue's and the associated audio's level out; transmitted gains are
  experimental (`experimental=drc-gains-0` to `drc-gains-3`), and the encoder does not compute them from
  the mix, with the presentation's gains, pans and scaling.
- **Evidence:** Text.

## Rates

### What wait_frames counts

- **Where:** Part 1 4.3.3.2.4 and Table 81, p. 73: the frames a decoder "should wait" after receiving
  the frame before its output; 6.2.4, p. 263, and Part 2 Annex B, pp. 217 and 218, which estimates the
  rate from sizes over m frames and `m + wait_frames(0) - wait_frames(m)`, give it a buffer's meaning.
- **Reading:** the whole frame periods between the frame's arrival, whole, over a channel at the
  stream's rate and its output, for a decoder that starts at the frame: its slack, floored (in twos at
  indices 10 to 12, where Table 81 counts in twos). Such a decoder outputs the frame up to a frame (two)
  early, so each frame keeps at least a frame (two) of slack and at most what the buffer holds: 1 to 5
  frames, or 2 to 11. Over m frames the sizes then come to within a frame (two) of Annex B's N'.
- **Evidence:** Text. The tests check, frame by frame and from the stream alone, that a decoder starting
  at any frame is never fed a frame late and that its buffer never holds more than 6.2.4 sets.

### br_code carries the raw frames' rate

- **Where:** Part 2 6.3.2.1.2 and Annex B, steps 2 to 4 and 13.
- **Reading:** the sequence carries the rate of the raw frames, `raw_ac4_frame()`s, in kbps, which is
  the rate the encoder is given; Annex B adds a sync frame's overhead to it as B. The writer sends 0b11
  and six base-3 digits of the fraction of log2 of the rate, a precision of 3^-6 of an octave, then 0b11
  again.
- **Evidence:** Text.
