// HMAC-SHA-256 (RFC 2104) over the SHA-256 in sha256.hpp. Internal to
// iclforge::signing. The key is passed in by the caller every time - this holds no
// key of its own, which is the whole point of the restructure that moved the
// signer into the clean-room tree: the algorithm is public (RFC 2104 / FIPS
// 180-4), only the key is secret, and the key is supplied at runtime.
