// HMAC-SHA-256 (RFC 2104) over the SHA-256 in sha256.hpp, which the EMDF Atmos signer
// (iclforge::ac3::signing) computes its tag with. The key is passed in by the caller every time
// - this holds no key of its own, which is the whole point of the restructure that moved the
// signer into the clean-room tree: the algorithm is public (RFC 2104 / FIPS 180-4), only the key
// is secret, and the key is supplied at runtime.
