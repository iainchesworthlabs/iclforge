// Programme loudness to ITU-R BS.1770-4, and the dialnorm (§5.4.2.8) that
// follows from it. Also the rest of an R128-style meter built on the same
// K-weighted, channel-summed signal: momentary/short-term loudness
// (BS.1770-4 §2's un-gated block power at two window sizes), Loudness Range
// (EBU Tech 3342's own gated-percentile statistic) and true-peak level
// (BS.1770-4 Annex 2's oversampled peak, independent of the loudness path
// entirely). Roadmap item C1.
//
// A/52 defines dialnorm as how far "the average dialogue level is below
// digital 100 percent" and never says how to measure it — the standard is
// from 1995 and BS.1770 is from 2006, so in the spec's own era the answer was
// a trained listener with a level meter. Every modern delivery specification
// that fills the gap names BS.1770 gated loudness (ATSC A/85, EBU R 128), so
// that is what this encoder measures, and dialnorm is the negated integrated
// loudness rounded to the nearest dB. For material with no dialogue at all —
// music, effects — the integrated programme loudness IS the anchor A/85 asks
// for, so one measurement serves both cases.
//
// The measurement is inherently two-pass: the relative gate needs the whole
// programme before any block's contribution is known. A streaming encoder
// therefore cannot derive dialnorm from the frame it is encoding; the caller
// measures first and configures the encoder second, which is exactly what
// real encoders do with an analysis pass.

// ITU-R BS.1770-5 (11/2023) Annex 3, "Extended loudness measurement algorithm
// for loudspeaker configurations of advanced sound systems", Table 4: the
// weighting coefficient Gi of a channel depends only on where that channel
// sits, given as an azimuth (theta) and an elevation (phi). Gi is
// 1.41 (+1.5 dB) when |phi| < 30 degrees AND 60 <= |theta| <= 120 degrees,
// and 1.00 (0 dB) everywhere else - including every upper-layer position,
// which is outside the |phi| < 30 row entirely. Annex 3 changes nothing else
// about the algorithm: "First, second and fourth stages of the algorithm
// (filtering and gating procedure) are the same as in the algorithm for the
// 3/2 multichannel format".
//
// Each Table E2.5 location below is placed at the BS.2051 loudspeaker label
// it stands for and its weight read off Table 4. Table 5 of the same Annex
// then tabulates that weight per BS.2051 configuration, which gives a second
// and independent check on every value: M+000/M±030 and M±SC at 1.00,
// M±060/M±090/M±110 at 1.41, M±135/M+180 at 1.00, and every U/T/B entry at
// 1.00.
//
// std::nullopt for the two LFE-type locations. That is not a zero weight:
// Annex 3 weights "each channel except the LFE channels", so an LFE-type
// channel is not a term in the sum at all - which is also why true peak,
// which does measure it, reads it from a separate path.
//
// NOTE for anyone cross-checking against another meter: ffmpeg's ebur128 does
// NOT implement Annex 3. Probed one channel at a time with a 997 Hz tone, it
// weights a 7.1 layout's BACK surrounds (M±135) at 1.41, the same as its side
// surrounds - i.e. it generalises Annex 1's Table 3 by channel NAME rather
// than by position, so anything called a surround gets +1.5 dB. Table 4 and
// Table 5 both put M±135 at 1.00, and this function follows the standard, so
// the two disagree by 1.5 dB on those two channels by design. On 5.1, where
// the only surrounds are M±110, the two agree exactly - measured to within
// 0.02 dB, which is what makes ffmpeg a usable oracle for the Annex 1 path
// and not for this one.
