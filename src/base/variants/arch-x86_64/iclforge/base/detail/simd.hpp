// The x86-64 (SSE2) member of the arch seam. See
// src/arithmetic/variants/arch-generic/iclforge/arithmetic/detail/simd.hpp for what the
// seam is, how CMake selects between the three directories, and why no
// header here needs a preprocessor conditional to name its architecture.
//
// SSE2 AND ONLY SSE2, deliberately: it is part of the x86-64 architecture
// itself, so every operation below is available on every 64-bit x86 CPU ever
// made, needs no -march= flag, and needs no runtime cpuid dispatch. Scalar
// double arithmetic on x86-64 already goes through these same SSE2 units, so
// _mm_add_pd/_mm_sub_pd/_mm_mul_pd are the identical IEEE-754 operations the
// scalar code was performing, two at a time - which is the whole
// bit-exactness argument, and why this file uses no approximate reciprocal,
// no rsqrt, and no min/max instruction (whose NaN and signed-zero rules
// differ from the C++ operators the scalar reference uses).
//
// Everything wider - AVX's 256-bit ymm, AVX-512, and the FMA3 instructions
// that would let a butterfly fuse its multiply and add - is a CPU-FEATURE
// question rather than an architecture one, and turning any of them on at
// compile time would produce a binary that faults on hardware without them.
// That needs runtime dispatch, which this seam does not have; see
// docs/building.md.

// (roundpd arrives with SSE4.1, and even that rounds ties to EVEN, which is
// not what std::round does), so this is built out of arithmetic. The
// alternative it replaces is a call to libm's round(), which MSVC and the
// System V libraries both leave out of line - about 9,100 of them per
// encoded frame (inline to_fixed25 fusion).
//
// The construction, on the MAGNITUDE a = |x| so the tie case has only one
// direction to worry about:
//
//   t = (a + 2^52) - 2^52
//       The classic magic-number round. For a < 2^52 the addition forces
//       every fractional bit off the bottom of the significand and the
//       subtraction is exact, so t = a rounded to an integer under the
//       CURRENT rounding mode - round-to-nearest-EVEN, which is the mode
//       this project never changes and every other double in it assumes.
//   a - t == 0.5  <=>  a was an exact tie that round-to-even took DOWNWARDS
//       (2.5 -> 2). Ties it took upwards (1.5 -> 2) are already the
//       ties-away answer, and non-ties are unaffected. Both a and t are
//       exactly representable and within a factor of two of each other, so
//       the difference is exact.
//   t + 1 in that case; then re-apply the sign bit of x.
//
//   a >= 2^52 (which includes +/-inf) means x is already an integer and the
//   magic-number step would be a no-op at best, so those lanes select x
//   unchanged. A NaN compares unordered, takes the arithmetic path, and
//   propagates through it.
//
// tests/ac3/core/test_simd_kernels.cpp pins this against std::round() over the
// tie ladder, the powers of two either side of the magic number, denormals,
// both zeros, infinities and a large pseudorandom spread.
