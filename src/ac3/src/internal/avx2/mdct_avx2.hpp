// AVX2 kernel bodies for src/ac3/src/core/mdct.cpp, dispatched behind
// iclforge::internal::cpu::has_avx2() at each call site in that file. Declared
// here with PLAIN std::span/double signatures - no AVX2 type ever appears
// outside mdct_avx2.cpp itself - so mdct.cpp (compiled without any AVX2
// flag, see src/ac3/CMakeLists.txt's forge_simd_avx2 target) can call
// these across the object-library boundary without ever seeing an
// intrinsic. See simd_avx2.hpp for the f64x4 type these are built from and
// docs/building.md's "Runtime AVX2 dispatch" section for the mechanism.
//
// Each function here is a straight four-lanes-instead-of-two transliteration
// of its f64x2 counterpart in mdct.cpp: identical operations in identical
// order, so the result is bit-identical, not merely close - the same
// argument mdct.cpp's own comments make for the SSE2 seam.

// windowing/de-interleave - but with one f64x4 per BIN holding all four
// objects' values for that bin, instead of one f64x2/f64x4 per group of
// bins within a single object's own spectrum (contrast with
// imdct512_pre_twiddle/imdct512_post_twiddle above, which batch ACROSS
// bins of ONE transform; this batches ACROSS four INDEPENDENT transforms).
// Every step in between the two layout seams (the FFT itself, the
// negate-copy, the post-twiddle) is unit-stride f64x4 arithmetic with
// nothing to gather or scatter, since the bin axis stays in natural order
// the whole way through exactly as it does for one object.
//
// The two seams themselves - object-major spans in, object-major spans out,
// f64x4-per-bin in the middle - are paid in 4x4 block transposes (eight
// shuffles per sixteen doubles, see simd_avx2.hpp's transpose4x4): the
// spectra are interleaved once up front into an 8KB dense scratch, and the
// step-5 windowing transposes each region's four consecutive output rows
// straight into four contiguous per-object stores. This is the THIRD shape
// this function has had, and the reason is measured, not aesthetic: the
// first paid the seam in f64x4::set serial-insert gathers and
// lane0()..lane3() extraction scatters inside the kernel (~1% over plain
// scalar on a real joc-domain=mdct decode); the second moved the whole
// interleaving out into ReconstructionState so the kernel boundary was
// free, which made the kernel itself faster but the CALLER ~8% slower -
// its accumulation and overlap-add passes then strode through [bin][slot]
// memory at a cache line per double (net ~7% worse than the first). The
// transposes keep the caller's layout natural AND the kernel boundary
// cheap; git history holds both earlier designs and their numbers.
//
// coeffs0..3 and x0..3 are the same 256/512-long spans
// iclforge::ac3::imdct512_windowed itself takes; cos1/sin1 are imdct512_windowed's
// own twiddle table (kQuarter = 128 long); fft is the P = 128 FFT table
// the long transform's own fast fold already shares
// (fast_mdct_tables<512>().fft) - passed in rather than looked up here
// because both live in mdct.cpp's anonymous namespace, invisible outside
// that translation unit; this is a plain-old-data struct (no AVX2 type),
// so passing a reference across the object-library boundary is safe.

// each of its four index walks is contiguous in groups of four - two
// ascending, two descending, and a descending run is just the same
