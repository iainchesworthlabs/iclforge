// What a syncframe's audio blocks actually said, as opposed to what they
// decoded to.
//
// A decoder's ordinary output answers "what does this stream sound like".
// A bug report needs the other question - which coding tools were in force,
// block by block, and what exponent strategy each stream was carrying - and
// that information is destroyed the moment the mantissas are turned into
// coefficients. Nothing in DecodedFrame/DecodedSubstream survives to say
// whether block 3 used spectral extension or why channel 1's exponents were
// reused.
//
// So the decoders record it here on the way past, into a caller-owned trace,
// on exactly the terms verify::FrameTrace already established: a null pointer
// in the DecoderConfig means not one byte of this is written, and a non-null
// one costs a branch per block. This is the syntax counterpart of that
// header - mirror.hpp compares an encoder's model against a decoder's to
// localise a desync, this simply reports what the wire said - and the two are
// deliberately separate types, because a trace kept for a whole file's worth
// of frames wants none of mirror.hpp's per-bin exponent/bap vectors.
//
// `forge probe`'s per-block dump is built on this; see ac3/io/probe.hpp.
