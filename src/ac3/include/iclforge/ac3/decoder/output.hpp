// The decoder's output stage: what happens between "the coded channels have
// been reconstructed" and "these are the samples a listener hears".
//
// Everything here is off by default. The decoders exist first as a check on
// the encoder, and a stage that silently re-levelled or re-folded their
// output would destroy that - see DecoderConfig::drc_scale's own comment for
// the same reasoning applied to §7.7. A caller that wants a listenable
// rendering rather than the coded channels asks for one.
//
// Three things live here, in the order §7.7/§7.8 apply them:
//
//   1. dialnorm normalisation (§5.4.2.8). The stream says where its dialogue
//      sits; a decoder normalising to the -31 dBFS reference attenuates by
//      the difference, which is what makes two programmes cut together at a
//      consistent loudness. Dual mono (acmod 0) codes two UNRELATED
//      programmes in one syncframe, each with its own dialnorm - §5.4.2.16's
//      dialnorm2 for Ch2 - so this step takes an optional second dialnorm
//      and normalises Ch2 by its own reference rather than by Ch1's.
//   2. The §7.8 downmix, to Lo/Ro stereo, Lt/Rt stereo or mono, driven by
//      the stream's OWN mix levels (AC-3's cmixlev/surmixlev or Annex D's
//      xbsi1 group, E-AC-3's mixmdate group) rather than by constants chosen
//      here.
//   3. RF mode's overload protection, which only exists because §7.7.2's
//      compr guarantee is about the mono downmix and not about whichever
//      fold this stage was actually asked for.
//
// §7.7's dynrng/compr gain itself is NOT here: both decoders apply it to the
// COEFFICIENTS, before the IMDCT, so the overlap-add window cross-fades a
// per-block gain change instead of stepping it (see decoder.cpp's own comment
// at that site). OperatingMode below selects which of the two words is used,
// and whether a compr word comes with RF mode's 11 dB; the arithmetic stays
// where it belongs. So an RF-mode decode's level is only partly this stage's:
// the dialnorm normalisation is, the 11 dB above it are the decoders'.
