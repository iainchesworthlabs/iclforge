// The in-repo AC-3 / E-AC-3 decoder — the validation pyramid's strongest
// correctness anchor (fully normative, shares tables/bit-allocation/exponents/
// IMDCT with the encoder core).
//
// AC-3 scope (bsid <= 8): any acmod 0/0..3/2 plus LFE, long blocks,
// D15/D25/D45/reuse exponents, full bit allocation including delta bit
// allocation (§7.2.2.6), mantissa ungrouping, coupling (strategy, banded
// coordinates, phase flags and leak parameters) and 2/0 rematrixing.
// acmod 0 (1+1 dual mono) is two independent programmes sharing one
// syncframe — Ch2's dialnorm2/compr2/dynrng2 are parsed and reported
// alongside Ch1's, and each programme's §7.7 gain is applied to its own
// channel only. Block switching (§8.2.2/§7.9) is decoded too — DecodedFrame::
// blksw reports which blocks used the short transform. dynrng words are
// parsed but not applied; bap-0 bins reconstruct per §7.3.4's dithflag - a
// true zero when it is clear, a dither sample (DitherGenerator, deterministic
// per decoder instance) when it is set. A coupled channel's shared bap-0
// bins are dithered independently per RECEIVING channel, after decoupling,
// per §7.3.4's own "uncorrelated" requirement - never by dithering the
// shared coupling-channel coefficient itself.
//
// E-AC-3 scope (Annex E, bsid 11-16): the whole of Tables E1.2/E1.3/E1.4 as
// syntax — every metadata payload is walked correctly whether or not its
// contents are used — plus dependent substreams, chanmap and the §E3.8.2
// render. Every coding tool Annex E adds on top of AC-3 is implemented: AHT,
// spectral extension, enhanced coupling (§E3.5) including its angle
// interpolation, and transient pre-noise processing (§3.7) over every reach
// its syntax can express - individually or all stacked together. Annex E's
// default coupling band structures decode too: standard coupling falls back
// to Table E2.12, enhanced coupling to Table E2.13. Transient pre-noise
// processing has one consequence for this class's own API: see
// decode_substream and flush() below. This is the only oracle 7.1.4 has:
// FFmpeg rejects any frame with substreamid != 0, so a stream with two
// dependent substreams cannot be checked against it in any container. Every
// substream's own dynrng/dynrng2 words are reported on DecodedSubstream, same
// convention as DecodedFrame, and optionally applied per Eac3Decoder's own
// constructor — see DecoderConfig below.
//
// The §7.7 dynamic range words are always reported and optionally applied —
// see DecoderConfig. Reporting them separately from applying them is what
// makes this useful as a check on the encoder: a test can assert on the words
// the encoder chose AND on the level change they cause, and those are two
// different claims.

// the last successfully decoded BLOCK's windowed transform output, and
// synthesise the concealed frame's blocks from it through the same
// overlap-add the real ones went through. A concealed frame therefore leaves
