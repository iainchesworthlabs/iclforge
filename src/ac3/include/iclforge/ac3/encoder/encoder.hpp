    // --- decision search (ac3/quality) -------------------------------------

    // and written into every frame of the encode. The comment at their
    // declaration in encoder.cpp records why they were never searched: the
    // only in-loop criterion this encoder had was the composite SNR offset,
    // and that number is not comparable between two code sets because each
    // produces a different masking curve for the offset to sit on.
    //
    // iclforge::ac3::quality supplies the criterion that was missing - the error the
    // decoder will actually reconstruct - so with this set the encoder tries
    // a small set of candidate BitAllocCodes per frame, and decides the
    // delta-bit-allocation race on measured error rather than on the
    // composite offset each pass happened to reach.
    //
    // kNone by default, and not just because the search costs real time.
    // Validated on real CC0/CC-BY programme material against FFmpeg's decode
    // (SNR, log-spectral distance, ViSQOL MOS-LQO -
    // docs/library/encoding-ac3.md's own table has the numbers): kDistortion
    // is a real, repeatable win from 448 kbit/s up, but at 192 kbit/s its own
    // criterion still improves while LSD and MOS both worsen - redistributing
    // bits away from dbpbcod's quiet-band floor buys back less SNR than it
    // costs in per-band spectral shape at that budget. kPerceptual
    // loses outright at every rate tested, despite its psychoacoustic model
    // being independently validated (tests/ac3/quality/test_perceptual.cpp): its
    // objective correctly discounts already-masked headroom, which leaves it
    // much thinner decision margins than raw distortion, and on real stereo
    // material with rematrixing active those margins are landing on the
    // wrong side of external metrics. This project does not turn a decision
    // knob on without the numbers to justify it, and right now only
    // kDistortion at the higher rates has them. `forge encode search=...`

    // allocation and delta correction - into this trace, for comparison
    // against a real decode of the same frame. Null by default, and null
    // costs one branch per block and no allocation: the encoder's behaviour
    // and output are identical either way, this only reads state it already
    // has. A runtime pointer rather than a build-time switch because that is
    // how every other optional behaviour in this struct is expressed, and
