// Changing a stream's bsi metadata WITHOUT re-encoding the audio.
//
// dialnorm, compr, bsmod and dsurmod are all delivery decisions - what a
// receiver is told the dialogue level is, how hard to compress on an RF
// output, what kind of service this is, whether the surrounds were matrixed.
// Every one of them lands in bsi, ahead of the first audblk, and none of them
// changes a single coded coefficient. Re-encoding a programme to correct one
// costs a whole generation of lossy coding for no reason; this rewrites the
// bits in place and re-stamps the frame's CRCs instead, so the audio comes
// back out of a decoder bit-identical to what went in.
//
// The CRCs are the part that is not obvious. crc2 is an ordinary trailing
// CRC - recompute over the covered region and store it. crc1 is not: A/52
// §7.10.1 puts it BEFORE the region it protects and requires the register to
// read zero once the first 5/8 of the syncframe has been shifted through, so
// it has to be SOLVED rather than computed. iclforge::ac3::solve_leading_crc
// (ac3/core/crc16.hpp) does that with a GF(2) polynomial inverse, and is the
// same function the encoder itself uses - see its own comment.
//
// Scope, stated as limits rather than left to be discovered:
//
//   * Only fields ALREADY ON THE WIRE can change. compr lives behind compre,
//     bsmod and dsurmod behind E-AC-3's infomdate; a frame that did not
//     transmit one has no bits to overwrite, and inserting them would move
//     every bit after and re-frame the syncframe - which is a re-encode by
//     another name. Asking for such a field is kFieldAbsent, and the answer
//     is to encode (or transcode) the stream with it enabled.
//   * A DEPENDENT E-AC-3 substream reports no compr at all, whatever its
//     compre bit says: §E3.8.5 repurposes compre there to mark the last
//     dependent of the programme rather than to announce a compression word
//     (see decoder.hpp's DecodedSubstream::compr). Its 8 bits are still on
//     the wire and are still skipped correctly; they are simply not a compr
//     word, so this refuses to write one into them.
//   * strmtyp 2 (a "convertible" substream, §E2.3.1.1) is refused outright,
//     matching iclforge::ac3::plan::validate's own stance - its bsi carries an extra
//     blkid/frmsizecod branch nothing in this project produces or consumes.
