// Reading the shape of an AC-3 or E-AC-3 elementary stream back off the wire.

// the access-unit boundaries and work out what the stream actually carries.
// A muxer needs exactly this - a container has to know where packets begin and
// how many channels to declare - and deriving it from the bitstream beats
// asking the caller, who can be wrong.
//
// Both formats put bsid at bit 40, deliberately, so a reader can tell them
// apart before committing to a layout: AC-3 spends its first 40 bits on
// syncword, crc1, fscod and frmsizecod, and E-AC-3 on syncword, strmtyp,
// substreamid, frmsiz, fscod, numblkscod, acmod and lfeon.
