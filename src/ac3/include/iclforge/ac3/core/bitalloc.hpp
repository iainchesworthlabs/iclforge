// The A/52 §7.2.2 parametric bit allocation — the decoder-defined heart of
// AC-3. The decoder recomputes this routine from transmitted parameters
// using exact integer arithmetic, so this implementation must be bit-exact;
// it is validated against an independent Python transcription of the spec
// pseudocode (tools/references/bitalloc_ref.py) with zero tolerance.
//
// Scope: fbw, LFE and coupling channels — the coupling channel enters higher
// up the spectrum and seeds its leak state from cplfleak/cplsleak instead of
// running lowcomp (§7.2.2.4), which BitAllocRegion below selects. Delta bit
// allocation (§7.2.2.6) lets an encoder nudge the masking curve this routine
// derives from exponents alone, in either direction, per band.
