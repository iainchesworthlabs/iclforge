// An AC-4 decoder: ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1 (2025-07), "Part 1: Channel based
// coding", and ETSI TS 103 190-2 V1.3.1 (2025-07), "Part 2: Immersive and
// personalized audio", written from the published texts. Clause numbers
// below name the part that defines the element; Part 2 clause 6 amends Part 1
// clause 4 for bitstream_version 2, which is what every stream this project
// has seen uses.
//
// What this version does: it reads every syntax element of a raw AC-4
// frame's substreams - the presentation substream, channel-coded audio
// substreams in the Part 1 channel elements (their HSF extension substreams,
// ac4_hsf_ext_substream(), included), and EMDF payload substreams - and
// reports what a frame carries. It decodes to PCM the mono, stereo, 3.0, 5.X
// and 7.X channel elements in every codec mode Part 1 gives them (SIMPLE,
// ASPX and the A-CPL modes), at every frame rate of Part 1 Tables 83 and 84:
// the audio spectral frontend, stereo and multichannel processing, the
// inverse transform with block switching, frame alignment, the QMF domain's
// companding, A-SPX and A-CPL (Part 1 clauses 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7),
// and at every frame_rate_index but 13 the sample rate converter from the
// internal rate to 48 kHz (clause 6.2.15), its phase locked to
// sequence_counter (Part 2 clause 5.11). It decodes the immersive element of
// the 7.X.4 and 9.X.4 channel modes (Part 2 clause 6.2.4, b_5fronts for the
// 9.X.4 modes) in every codec mode, in full or core decoding (DecodingMode),
// with Part 2's stereo and multichannel processing, S-CPL, A-SPX, A-CPL and
// A-JCC (clauses 5.2 to 5.6), and renders it by Part 2's channel renderer
// (clause 5.10.2, DownmixTarget; a 9.X layout is no target, Tables 35 to 37
// being left out). It decodes
// the 22.2 channel element (Part 2 clause 6.2.4.3) in full decoding, SIMPLE and
// ASPX, to its 24 channels in the order of Part 2 Table A.27's speaker indices:
// no renderer or downmix has a 22.2 input (Tables 35 to 43), so it is delivered
// as coded alone. It decodes the presentation a system chooses (Part 2 clause
// 4.8.2) with all its substreams: music and effects with dialogue, main audio
// with associated audio, both, and a main substream with the dialogue
// enhancement substream the hybrid dialogue enhancement methods take (Part 1
// clauses 5.7.8.9 and 6.2.16, Part 2 clauses 4.8.3.17 to 4.8.4). It decodes
// object audio (Part 2 clauses 4.8.3.4, 4.8.3.13 and 4.8.3.19): A-JOC
// substreams in full and core decoding (clause 5.7), with A-JOC's dialogue
// enhancement (5.8.2.3 and 5.8.2.4), and direct-coded object substreams with
// theirs (5.8.2.5), to each object's PCM and the properties its object audio
// metadata sets (clause 6.3.9, Annex F), for the application to render
// (DecodedFrame::objects); it renders an intermediate spatial format itself
// (clause 5.10.3). The table of contents and the substream framing come from
// iclforge::ac4::parse_raw_frame (the inspector, src/ac4); this library starts
// where the inspector stops.
//
// A presentation in the efficient high frame rate mode (Part 2 clause 5.1.3)
// spreads one codec frame over frame_rate_fraction (2 or 4) transmission
// frames. The decoder holds their fragments (Figure 8's FIFO) and decodes the
// unit when its last frame arrives: decode() returns no frame for the others,
// parse() a report without substreams, and the frame decode() returns is at
// the audio frame rate of Table 18, with the unit's first sequence_counter
// divided by the fraction as its own (ERRATA.md).
//
// It decodes the speech spectral frontend (Part 1 clause 5.2) for the tracks
// that select it, from the text alone: no stream here uses the tool, and
// ERRATA.md gives the readings the text's defects needed.
//
// What it refuses, with DecodeError::kUnsupported and a reason: the 9.X.4
// channel modes (Part 2's immersive element with b_5fronts), core decoding of
// the 22.2 channel element (Table 8 supports full decoding alone) and its
// rendering to any DownmixTarget but kAsCoded, an intermediate spatial format
// mixed into channels Annex A.2.1 has no matrix for, a 96/192 kHz substream
// whose HSF extension substream could not be resolved and read alongside it,
// and a substream no element of the table of contents this decoder reads names
// (an HSF extension substream no ac4_hsf_ext_substream_info() names among
// them). Refusing is per substream and per frame; the next frame is attempted
// afresh. decode() refuses, the same way, what it reads and does not turn into
// PCM: a substream at 96 or 192 kHz.
//
// ERRATA.md beside this library records where the two standards are
// ambiguous or defective and the reading taken for each.
