# Contributing to ICL Forge

## Build and test

Setup is in [docs/building.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/building.md). The short form, from any shell (a Developer PowerShell is not required — see that page):

```bash
cmake --preset config-windows-msvc-debug && cmake --build --preset build-windows-msvc-debug && ctest --preset test-windows-msvc-debug
```

There is no bare `debug` preset — swap `windows-msvc` for whichever platform/compiler fragment matches your machine (`windows-msvc-arm64`, `windows-llvm`, `linux-gcc`, `linux-llvm`, `linux-gcc-arm64`, `linux-llvm-arm64`, `macos-llvm`, `macos-llvm-x64`).

Before you push, `python tools/ci/precheck.py` runs the static checks the pull-request gate runs
(ruff, the documentation path check, the platform and support matrices, the fixture corpus, the
preprocessor-conditional rule, patch attribution and the branch name) in seconds and prints what
the gate will build; a check whose tool is missing says SKIP. `--unit` adds the unit tests of the
scripts under `tools/`.

Everything must pass before you push. No test is expected to fail, and the few cases that skip
themselves do so only when the machine cannot run them (an unset environment variable naming
local streams, a CPU with no AVX2, a file system that refuses a symlink). If something fails,
that is your change or a regression, not noise.

## Branches and pull requests

The branch model is trunk-based (GitHub Flow): `main` is the only long-lived branch, and every
topic branch merges straight into it — there is no separate integration branch to land on
first. Topic branches are named `<type>/<short-name>`, with `<type>` one of `feature`,
`bugfix`, `hotfix`, `docs`, or `chore`. The short name is lowercase letters and digits
separated by single hyphens — no underscores, dots, spaces, other special characters, or
trailing hyphens (for example `feature/eac3-decoder` or `chore/bump-packaging-manifests`).
CI's `Branch Name` check enforces
`^(feature|bugfix|hotfix|docs|chore)/[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$` on every PR (Dependabot's
`dependabot/**` branches are exempt), and its error message points back to this file.

PRs target `main`. To merge, a PR must pass the required checks: `Branch Name`, the `CI Status`
aggregate and the `Scan dependency diff` dependency review. `CI Status` is the pull-request gate
(`pr-gate.yml`): the static checks, then a Linux GCC build with every test and the gold-reference
gate. A merge queue serializes landing when several PRs are ready at once, and runs the gate on
the merged tree with the Qt GUI built, plus Windows MSVC and, for a change to a library's code (`libs/`, outside its `tests/` and `fuzz/`), a speed
and a heap-churn comparison against the commit the entry is queued on: a workload that takes
twice as long, or whose heap churn at least doubles, fails the entry unless the PR carries
`perf-regression-approved` or `memory-regression-approved`. The rest runs after the merge: the
other compilers and platforms one run at a time, and nightly the sanitizers, coverage, the FFmpeg
validation and every other leg. When a merge breaks `main`, `main-health` opens a `main-red`
issue naming the merges since the last verified commit. A change that needs more than the gate
before it merges (an ESP-IDF, Android or WASM change, a sanitizer question) can label its PR
`ci:deep` or dispatch `ci.yml` on its branch. [CI for many agents](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/ci-agentic.md)
describes the stages, and
[.github/branch-protection.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/.github/branch-protection.md)
has the required-check list and the merge-queue rationale. clang-tidy, CodeQL, MSVC
PREfast and SonarCloud do not gate a PR: they run nightly against `main` and open a
`nightly-analysis` issue when a run finds something new (same file, "Nightly analysis and
other visible-only scanners"). Releases are tags cut directly
from `main` — see [docs/releasing.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/releasing.md).

## The clean-room rule

This is the constraint the whole project rests on. Breaking it makes the code unusable.

- Every table and algorithm is transcribed from the published standard — ATSC A/52:2018, or
  for the object layer ETSI TS 103 420 and TS 102 366, or for AC-4 ETSI TS 103 190-1 and -2
  (and IEC 61937-14 for its carriage in IEC 61937 bursts) — with its section or table number
  cited in a comment.
- Open-source encoders (FFmpeg, Aften, anything else) may be consulted for **architecture
  lessons only**. Never transcribe code. The spec contains every table, so there is never a
  need to. For AC-4 the rule is stricter: another decoder, librempeg's for one, runs as a
  separate program whose output is compared, and its source is not read.
- Two exceptions, normative by construction: TS 103 420 ships its JOC Huffman tables *as* a C
  file in its companion archive, and TS 103 190 ships AC-4's Huffman codebooks, the QMF window
  and the A-JOC and A-JCC codebooks the same way. Those files are the standard, not an
  implementation of it.
- Where a standard is ambiguous or contradicts itself, the reading taken and its evidence go in
  an `ERRATA.md` beside the code (`libs/ac4/ERRATA.md`, `libs/ac4/ERRATA.md`).

If you cannot cite where something came from, it does not go in.

## Repository layout

**`libs/` is the installable library; `apps/` consumes it, never the reverse.** `libs/` holds 12
libraries. Each is a directory with its own CMake target (`iclforge::<name>`), its own public
headers (`iclforge/<name>/`, under `include/`), its sources (`src/`), its tests (`tests/`, a binary
of their own: `ctest -L <name>`), its libFuzzer harnesses (`fuzz/`, with their seeds and the inputs
that once broke them) and its own row in `tools/checks/layering.json`, which lists the libraries it
may include from; `check_layering.py` fails an include its row does not list, and reads neither
`tests/` nor `fuzz/`, which consume libraries. A
library's public headers declare into the namespace named for it under the family's root, and
`check_namespaces.py` (its table is `tools/checks/namespaces.json`) fails a header that declares
into another library's namespace, or into `iclforge` itself.
`libs/ac3` is the AC-3, E-AC-3 and Atmos codec, in namespace `iclforge::ac3`. `libs/ac4` is the
AC-4 codec, in namespace `iclforge::ac4`, laid out by the same areas (`core`, `io`, `decoder`,
`encoder`), and links nothing from `libs/ac3`.
The two codecs stand on libraries that know no codec: `libs/base` (bit I/O, the speaker vocabulary,
the CPU probe, the signing key, SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA-256, and, header-only and not installed,
`Fixed32`, the project's own float functions and the SIMD seam), `libs/dsp` (the transforms more
than one library uses), `libs/objects` (the object-audio model and the Object Audio Metadata
payload), `libs/render` (layouts, routing and the renderer) and `libs/containers` (IEC 61937 burst
packing, and the Matroska, MP4, MPEG-TS and IAMF writers and readers, each in a part of its own).
`apps/{cli,gui,crucible,hearth,android,wasm,baremetal}` consume them (Crucible and the Shield app
use the AC-3, E-AC-3 and Atmos codec only), and `apps/common` is shared application code,
compiled directly into its consumers. `apps/windows` holds Crucible's separately licensed
null-sink driver and its guest VM, `apps/linux` a scripted guest for Crucible's Linux tray, and
`apps/notices` the licence notices Forge's packages install. Nothing under `libs/` may depend on
anything under `apps/`.

**The tree holds four products, and the directories say which is which.** `libs/`
other than `libs/audio` and `libs/sendspin`, the bindings under `python/`, `js/` and `rust/`, and
`examples/` and `apps/baremetal` are **the library**; `iclforge` names it, and names its
packages too. `apps/cli`, `apps/gui` and `apps/common` are **Forge**, the tooling pair, built and
packaged as one thing. `apps/crucible`, with the driver in `apps/windows`, is **Crucible**.
`apps/hearth`, `libs/sendspin` and the `hearth_sink` example are **Hearth**. `apps/android` and
`apps/wasm` are library demonstrations. `libs/audio`, `tests/`, `tools/`, `cmake/`, `packaging/`
and the version line are shared and owned by no one product.
[The naming and scope plan](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/recasting.md)
records what each member owns, down to the targets, packages and CI legs, under the names it was
written with; [Renamed](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/renamed.md) maps them
to the present ones.

**These naming rules govern prose and code.** In prose, "ICL Forge" is the family, and **Forge**,
capitalised and standing alone, is the `forge` + `forge-gui` pair; Hearth and Crucible are named
as themselves, and "ICL Forge Forge" is never written. In code, `iclforge` names the library and
the family's identifiers: the CMake package, the packages of each language, the namespace root,
the header root and the C symbol prefix (`iclforge_`), with `ICLFORGE_` for macros, options and
environment variables. Every identifier stays lowercase but those. `forge --version` prints
`iclforge <version>` (`libs/base/src/version.cpp`), because that is the library's version line and
the Homebrew formula's test asserts it.

**A library's headers are `include/iclforge/<name>/`, and the name is the library.** The second
component of an include path says which library a header belongs to: `iclforge/ac3/decoder/decoder.hpp`
is in `libs/ac3/include/iclforge/ac3/decoder/`, `iclforge/render/layout.hpp` in
`libs/render/include/iclforge/render/`. A library includes headers only of the libraries its row of
`layering.json` lists. `base`, `dsp`, `objects`, `render` and `containers` list no codec, nor do the
readers (`adm`, `iab`): none of them knows
AC-3, E-AC-3 or Atmos exist, and they should stay that way. The AC-4 library lists none of
`ac3`'s: a separate codec that shares no bitstream syntax with it. Its core (`libs/ac4/src/core`) is
what the decoder and the encoder share, and has no public headers.

The one deliberate exception to the header root is `capi`: it installs under
`include/iclforge_c/`, not `iclforge/`, even though it depends on the codecs directly (it wraps
`iclforge::ac3_static` and the AC-4 library). The `iclforge/` tree is C++; `capi` is a C-callable
surface, and a C or non-C++ consumer has no reason to see, or accidentally `#include`, a C++
header.

**One subdirectory per platform audio backend, selected by CMake, never `#ifdef`.**
`libs/audio/src/backend/{alsa,pipewire,android,macos,posix,windows}` — adding a backend means a
new directory and a new CMake guard, not a new preprocessor branch. There are no
preprocessor conditionals in `libs/`, `apps/`, `tests/`, `external/` or `python/` (the C API header's
`#ifdef __cplusplus` pair is the one exemption, and `esp-idf/` uses Kconfig's `#if CONFIG_*`);
CI's platform check fails on a new one. Keep it that way.

**A leading underscore on a workflow file means "reusable, not directly triggered."**
`.github/workflows/_build.yml`, `_ci-core.yml`, `_ci-linux.yml`, `_ci-windows.yml`,
`_ci-macos.yml`, `_static.yml` and `_toolchain-versions.yml` are `workflow_call` targets, called by
`pr-gate.yml`, `ci.yml`, `release.yml` and (for `_toolchain-versions.yml`) the scheduled analysis
workflows; every other workflow file responds to a real GitHub event (`pull_request`, `push`, a
schedule) on its own, though `wheels.yml`, `npm.yml`, `esp-component.yml` and `manifest-bump.yml`
can also be called.

## Code conventions

**C++23, and use it.** `std::expected` for recoverable failure, `std::span` for borrowed
sequences, `fmt::print`/`fmt::format` for output — not the `std::print`/`std::format`
equivalents, since NDK r26's bundled libc++ has no `<format>` at all (see
`docs/platforms/android.md`) and {fmt} sidesteps the gap outright rather than routing around it
file by file — designated initializers for configuration structs, `constexpr` and `consteval` for
anything computable at build time. (A handful of older call sites already used C-style
`%`-specifier output before this convention existed; those keep their existing format strings but
go through `fmt::printf`/`<fmt/printf.h>`, not `std::printf`, for the same NDK reason.) The
window tables and several spec-table self-checks are
`consteval` — a table that is wrong fails the build rather than a test.

**One exception, for reading rather than writing.** {fmt} only formats *out*; it has no
`from_chars`-equivalent for parsing text *into* a `double`, and `<charconv>`'s own **floating-point**
`from_chars` is unavailable both on the NDK's bundled libc++ and at the macOS wheel's deployment
target (`'from_chars' is unavailable: introduced in macOS 26.0`) — the **integer** overloads are
fine everywhere and are used directly. Code that has to parse a decimal from user- or
file-supplied text therefore goes through `strtod` instead (`libs/ac3/src/encoder/plan.cpp`,
`encoder/assignment.cpp`, `libs/objects/src/scene_text.hpp`). Neither gap shows up on a Windows,
Linux or Homebrew-macOS build, so the CI legs that catch it are Android (Shield) and Build wheels
(macos-latest).

**Warnings are errors.** `iclforge::warnings` is linked privately into every first-party target,
including `examples/`. That includes `-Wsign-conversion` and its MSVC equivalents, which in
this codebase means a lot of explicit `static_cast<std::size_t>` on indices. Add the cast; do
not suppress the warning.

**No exceptions for stream-level failure.** A malformed bitstream, an out-of-range
configuration or a missing file are all expected conditions and return `std::expected`. A
programming error — the wrong number of samples in a frame — may assert.

**No allocation on the render path.** `spatial::BedRenderer::render_block` and the capture
ring are called at block rate; allocation there is a bug even when it works.

**`.clang-format` is checked in.** Run it.

## Comments explain why, with a citation

The single most useful thing in this codebase is a comment saying which part of the standard a
line implements and what would go wrong otherwise. Comments that restate the code are noise;
comments that record a decision are the reason the code can be maintained at all.

Good:

```cpp
// A/52 §5.4.4.1 puts aux user data at the END of the auxbits field, immediately
// before auxdatal, "so a decoder can find and unpack the auxdatal user bits
// without knowing the value of nauxbits" - nauxbits being unknowable until the
// whole frame has been decoded. So the container is not appended after the
// padding; the padding is what gets pushed in front of it.
```

That says what the spec requires, quotes the clause, and explains the non-obvious consequence.
A reader who wonders why padding comes first has their answer without opening the PDF.

Not useful:

```cpp
// Write the aux data.
```

Where behaviour is deliberately narrower than the standard, say so and say why — see the
opening comment of `libs/ac4/include/iclforge/ac4/decoder/decoder.hpp` for the pattern: what the decoder
does, then what it refuses, by name and with a reason. A clean refusal is a design statement;
a silent gap is a bug waiting to be found by someone else.

## Validation discipline

Two rules, both learned the hard way. Ignore either and your tests will pass while the code is
broken.

### Test with real audio, from frame 1 onward

**Silence is not a test signal.** With all SNR offsets at zero, §7.2.2.1.1 defines an all-zero
bit allocation: no mantissa data exists and the frame is pure syntax. A silent frame therefore
exercises almost none of the encoder, and passes whatever you have done to the parts it skips.

**Frame 0 is not a test either.** The MDCT overlap buffer starts at zero, so the first frame's
transform is a special case. Frame-layout errors, overlap-state errors and rate-accumulator
errors all show up from frame 2 onward and not before.

So: at least three frames, of material with actual content. Different content per channel when
the test is about channel order or separation — identical tones in two channels cannot
distinguish "the surrounds were overwritten correctly" from "the dependent substream was
ignored".

### Prove the test can fail

A regression test that has never failed is a test you have no evidence about. After writing
one, **reintroduce the bug it is meant to catch and confirm the test fails.** Then revert.

This is not optional ceremony. Several tests in this repo would have passed against the bug
they were written for, and were only fixed because someone checked.

## Oracles

Ranked by how much they prove. Prefer the strongest one available for what you are changing.

1. **The in-repo decoder.** Fully normative and sharing the encoder's core. Strongest for
   anything both sides implement, and the *only* oracle for 7.1.4.
2. **FFmpeg.** External and independent. Always strict-decode:
   `ffmpeg -v error -xerror -err_detect crccheck+bitstream+buffer+explode -i out.ac3 -f null -`.
   Without `-err_detect`, FFmpeg conceals errors and a broken stream looks fine. `-xerror` is not
   optional either, and is easy to miss: `-err_detect` alone only controls what the decoder
   treats as an error *internally* (concealing a bad frame and moving on) - it does not, by
   itself, change ffmpeg's own exit code, which stays 0 even after a logged CRC mismatch.
   `-xerror` ("exit on error") is the flag that turns a detected error into a failing process,
   which is what every script here checking only the exit code (all of them) actually needs.

   The in-repo decoder also reads Annex E coupling, spectral extension and AHT now, so FFmpeg is
   a second, independent check on them rather than the only one — except at 7.1.4, where point 1
   above is still the only decoder either way. Two separate CI mechanisms use FFmpeg, answering
   different questions:

   - **`ffmpeg-validate`** (Linux-only, in the nightly run; `ci:deep` on a pull request, or a
     dispatch of `ci.yml`, runs it on a branch): *correctness* across the full option space.
     `tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh`'s FFmpeg strict-decode checks for conformance,
     `tools/checks/check_drc.py` and `tools/checks/check_coupling.py`/`check_coupling_level.py` for metadata
     that only a discriminating decode can confirm, and `tools/ci/quality_race.py ci` for a numeric
     SNR/LSD floor per E-AC-3 tool variant. Running any of these locally needs `ffmpeg` on `PATH`
     and, for the Python ones, `ICLFORGE_CLI` (or `--cli`) pointed at your build's `forge`.
   - **The gold-reference gate** (`tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh`, in the pull-request
     gate and on every platform leg):
     *quality* and cross-platform reproducibility on one fixed sample - does forge's own decoder
     agree with FFmpeg's, by SNR, on every compiler this project builds with. See
     [docs/building.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/building.md#gold-reference-correctness-gate).

   The same job also runs `tools/checks/check_matrix_coverage.py`, which asks a different question: not
   "is the output correct" but "does anything exercise this at all". It reads the CLI's own
   canonical option lists (its usage text, and the "unknown layout"/"unknown tool set" messages a
   bad argument hits) and fails if a layout, Annex E tool token or command the CLI accepts is
   never exercised by `run_codec_matrix.sh`. Most of those are presence checks — the token has to
   appear somewhere in the script — but Annex E tool tokens are read only from the tool sets the
   matrix actually encodes with, after a token that appeared only as an unrelated option's *value*
   produced a false pass. So a new layout, tool token or command needs a matching matrix entry in
   the same change, or CI says so — see that script's own header for what it does and does not
   catch.

   Both of those walk a *hand-enumerated* list of command lines against one bootstrap tone, so
   neither has any notion of option *combinations* or of the input material. The same job's
   `tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py` step covers what that leaves: random legal encoder
   configurations crossed with adversarial PCM whose character changes part-way through a frame,
   every resulting stream held against both decoders. It exists because the `deltbaie` defect
   (`deltbaie = 0` means "retain", not "no delta") produced streams both decoders reject and
   escaped every gate above — reaching it needed an input *shape*, not an option combination.
   `tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py` and `tools/ci/fuzz_ac4_encoder_space.py` do the same for
   E-AC-3 and AC-4 (for AC-4 the streams are read back through the decoder and the syntax trace;
   FFmpeg only frames them). Each is bounded to two minutes in that job, and `fuzz.yml`'s
   `encoder-space-nightly` runs each for fifteen. Every failure prints a case seed that
   regenerates the exact input (`--replay <seed>`).
3. **Somebody else's bitstreams.** Points 1 and 2 both decode something this project encoded.
   Reading a stream *nobody here produced* is a different question, and the one that found five
   Annex E parsing defects in a single sitting once anything actually asked it. Two tiers, both
   automated: `tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh` decodes the six committed Dolby Encoding
   Engine and FFmpeg streams in `tests/golden/external-baseline/` on every gold-reference leg,
   and the nightly `Interop` workflow runs `tools/checks/verify_fate_interop.py` over eight
   SHA-256-pinned commercial-encoder excerpts fetched from FFmpeg's FATE archive. Reach for this
   one whenever you touch decoder syntax the encoder here never emits — and read
   [docs/verification.md](https://iainchesworthlabs.github.io/iclforge/verification/#third-party-bitstreams)
   first, because there are no free AC-3 or E-AC-3 conformance vectors and this is the
   substitute, not the real thing.
4. **The Python references in `tools/`.** Independent transcriptions of the same spec text.
   Weaker than a decoder — two transcriptions can share a misreading — but they catch slips a
   self-consistent round trip cannot.
5. **Dolby's Reference Player and Media Encoder**, for object-layer syntax.

**AC-4 has a ladder of its own**, set out in [docs/verification.md](https://iainchesworthlabs.github.io/iclforge/verification/#ac-4)
and in `planning/ac4.md`. FFmpeg reads AC-4's framing and its MP4 track and has no AC-4 decoder, so
it does not check audio. The decoder is scored against the streams Dolby Encoding Engine (DEE)
makes from known sources, the committed ones in `tests/golden/external-baseline/ac4-*` and a larger
gold set kept locally (DEE's licence ends on 2026-11-06 and is not renewed), by
`tools/checks/score_ac4_decode.py`; its gains and mixing are held to the standard's formulas by
`gain_ac4_decode.py` and `mix_ac4_decode.py`; librempeg's decoder is a second opinion wherever it
reads the stream; and the syntax is transcribed a second time in `tools/references/ac4_syntax.py`,
whose trace must agree with the C++ record for record. The encoder is held to the same trace
comparison, to MediaInfo's frame-by-frame reading and DEE's MP4 muxer
(`check_ac4_encode_readers.py`), and raced against DEE's streams of the same sources by
`score_ac4_encode.py`. Nothing outside the project decodes the immersive element or objects
(librempeg does not decode the one and refuses the other) or reads IEC 61937 bursts: for those,
say so in the commit message and hold the change to the standard's own tables and formulas, as
the tests there do.

**Object reconstruction has none of the four.** Dolby's tooling above verifies the object
layer's *syntax*, not its audio: that decoder gates object decoding on a keyed authenticity tag
this project ships no key for, so it renders these streams as their 5.1 bed, and FFmpeg
implements no JOC reconstruction at all. Nothing outside this repository can produce an
independent object decode of an ICL Forge stream. What exists instead is a self-consistency
series with real resolution — `tools/ci/quality_race.py`'s `objects` mode scores a committed
five-object scene per object per rate in the nightly run, trended at [Object quality
trend](https://iainchesworthlabs.github.io/iclforge/object-quality-trend/). If you are changing
`iclforge::objects::oba::joc` or `iclforge::oba`, run it before and after and put both numbers in the commit message;
it takes seconds and it is the only quality signal that layer has.

Neither decoder covers everything, and the gaps do not overlap: see the [verification-gap
table](https://iainchesworthlabs.github.io/iclforge/verification/#where-the-oracles-dont-reach). If your change lands in a cell with no oracle, say so in
the commit message and cover it bit-by-bit instead.

## Documentation

The examples in [docs/library/](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/library/index.md) are excerpts from programs in
[`examples/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/tree/main/examples), which are build targets and `ctest` entries. If you change a public
API, update the example — the build will tell you if you forget. Do not add a snippet to the
docs that is not backed by a compiled file.

If you add a capability or find a new limitation, the tables in
[docs/library/capabilities.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/library/capabilities.md)
("What it does" / "What it does not do") and, for oracle coverage specifically,
[docs/verification.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/verification.md)
are the authority and must be updated with it. README.md's own summary of the same material
should stay a summary, not grow back into a second copy. [docs/history.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/history.md) is a
record of past work and is not maintained against the current state.

The platform tables under `docs-snippets/generated/` are generated from
`docs/assets/data/support-catalogue.json` by `python tools/checks/generate_support_matrices.py`:
edit the JSON and regenerate, since the static checks fail on a stale copy. `python
tools/checks/check_doc_paths.py` checks every path the prose names, `python tools/ci/precheck.py`
runs both, and `python -m mkdocs build --strict` (after `pip install -r
requirements/requirements-docs.txt`) builds the site.

**Voice.** No hyperbole, marketing copy, or flourishes. State the fact; do not set it up as
"it is not A, it is B." Shorter is better. If two sentences say the same thing, keep one. Write
the codecs as AC-3, E-AC-3 and AC-4, hyphenated.

Product and usage pages — Forge, Crucible, Hearth (except `design/`), install and first-run
guides — are for a technical lay reader. Be clear, professional, and direct. Explain a domain
term on the page that uses it, not in a summary that points there. Examples and screenshots
belong where they show the thing being described, and they must match that context.

Developer pages — the library, building, platforms, CI, `design/` records, `planning/` — assume
a mid-level developer who does not already know this audio domain.

**Put information in one place.**

- README is the GitHub summary; `docs/index.md` routes readers into the site.
- A product index states current status and links to tasks. A usage page explains one task.
- A platform page records support and evidence for an operating system or device. Product
  walkthroughs stay with the product and link to platform measurements.
- `docs/concepts/` defines audio-domain terms. Developer pages link there when a term is not
  explained locally.
- `docs/performance-quality.md` and its trend pages own performance and quality reporting. Their
  client-side code reads append-only data from the `quality-history` branch. Preserve those page
  paths, element IDs, data names and branch-fed assets unless the data pipeline changes with them.
- `CHANGELOG.md` records user-visible changes by release.
- `ROADMAP.md` is the **status board** for in-flight, partial, proposed, blocked, and out-of-scope
  work. It uses plain-English names; do not allocate new numeric roadmap IDs (`EQ1`, `UX12`, …).
  Legacy IDs at the bottom of `ROADMAP.md` resolve old PR references only.
- Product index pages (`docs/*/index.md`) and [`docs/library/capabilities.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/library/capabilities.md)
  state **what ships today**.
- Detailed implementation decisions belong in [`planning/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/tree/main/planning)
  or a product's `design/` record. When a plan lands, update CHANGELOG and the product index; trim
  the roadmap row; leave or mark the plan superseded ([`planning/SUPERSEDED.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/SUPERSEDED.md)).

**Each product page set follows one shape.** An `index.md` opens with a status callout (what's
built, what isn't, what's verified on real hardware versus under emulation or in CI only),
sub-pages carry plain topic titles rather than repeating the product's binary name, and a
`design/` subfolder holds phase records and promotion plans — evidence a reference page cites,
not a guide a user reads first. [docs/crucible/design/promotion.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/crucible/design/promotion.md)
and [docs/hearth/design/player-appliance.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/hearth/design/player-appliance.md)
are the pattern to follow for a new one.

**Non-trivial design work starts in `planning/`, not `docs/`.** A phase plan, a naming decision,
or a proposal that touches more than a page or two belongs in
[`planning/`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/tree/main/planning) first —
see [`planning/README.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/tree/main/planning/README.md)
for the index and how it relates to the roadmap. `docs/` describes what exists; `planning/` is
where what might exist gets argued out first, and a page only moves (or a `design/` record
gets written) once the work has actually landed. Plans link to the roadmap for status; they do
not duplicate the roadmap's tables or allocate numeric roadmap IDs.

## Commits

**Never use a `Co-Authored-By` trailer.** This is absolute, and applies whatever tooling you
are using.

Write the subject as what the change does and, where it fits, why — the existing log is the
style guide:

```
cli: one command table, so an argv index cannot be quietly wrong
integration: drop the duplicate AC-3 channel map
```

Reference the spec section in the body when the change is a spec question. If a commit fixes
something an oracle found, say which oracle.

## Reporting a problem

Include the exact command, the stream if you can attach one, and what the oracle said. For a
decode problem, say which decoder — "it does not play" is not actionable when the in-repo
decoder and FFmpeg refuse different, documented things.
