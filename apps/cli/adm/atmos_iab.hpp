// IAB reader bridge, phase 3 - the narrow seam
// between main.cpp's 'atmos-iab' command and iclforge::iab/iclforge::admbridge, exactly the same
// "library-linked-or-not is a build-time FILE choice, never a preprocessor conditional" shape
// adm/atmos_adm.hpp already uses for 'atmos-adm' - see that header's own top comment for the full
// reasoning (tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1's own #ifdef ban is what rules out the obvious
// alternative). 'atmos-iab' needs iclforge::admbridge specifically (its own IAB mapping, gated by
// ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM the same as everything else in that module - see
// src/adm/CMakeLists.txt's own header comment) - NOT ICLFORGE_BUILD_IAB alone, which
// defaults ON and is not the gating question here: iclforge::iab by itself has nothing that can
// drive AtmosEncoder, only iclforge::admbridge's build_iab() does that, and that function only
// exists when ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM turned admbridge on. So this command reuses adm/atmos_adm.hpp's
// own Needs::kAdm/adm_capability() gate rather than asking a new question - the availability test
// is identical either way.
//
// apps/cli/CMakeLists.txt adds exactly one of adm/enabled/atmos_iab.cpp or
// adm/disabled/atmos_iab.cpp to the forge target; main.cpp calls load_iab_atmos_source below
// completely unconditionally either way, the same pattern atmos_adm.hpp's own
// load_adm_atmos_source already establishes.
namespace forge_cli {

// Everything run_atmos_iab (apps/cli/commands/atmos.cpp) needs from one parsed-and-bridged IAB
// source, expressed purely in iclforge::oba terms - the same shape AdmAtmosSource (atmos_adm.hpp)
// already uses for ADM, for the identical reason: main.cpp never needs iclforge::iab::IabError or
// iclforge::adm::BridgeError, only text to print. `handle` owns whatever `pcm`'s spans
// actually borrow from - for IAB this is the IabBridgeResult itself
// (iclforge::adm::build_iab), since its own `pcm` is OWNED storage rather than a borrow from
// a separate document object (see ac3/admbridge/iab_bridge.hpp's own top comment on why); keep an
// IabAtmosSource alive for exactly as long as its `pcm` spans are read.
