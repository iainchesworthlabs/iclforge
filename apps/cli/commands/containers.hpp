// The container-wrapping commands: mkv/mp4/fmp4/ts each take an already-encoded AC-3 or E-AC-3
// elementary stream and wrap it for a specific downstream consumption method, reading everything
// the container needs to declare (format, access-unit boundaries, sample rate, channel count)
// straight off the bitstream via iclforge::ac3::io::scan rather than from a caller-supplied layout
// that could disagree with what the file actually contains. Split out of main.cpp as part of the
// repo-structure review's H4 monolith split - see support.hpp's own top comment for the overall
// plan; this is the first commands/ group, the four physically-contiguous container commands
// (spdif is elsewhere in main.cpp and will be grouped with its own file-position neighbors in a
// later step, not here).

// Same shape as run_mkv, wrapping iclforge::containers::mp4::mux() instead: iclforge::ac3::io::scan() still
// supplies everything the container needs to declare, and additionally - via
// iclforge::ac3::io::build_codec_config_box() - the exact dac3/dec3 sample-entry payload straight
// off the bitstream.

// fMP4/CMAF segmenting plus HLS/DASH signaling - writes a DIRECTORY of files
// (an init segment, one media segment per fragment, an HLS media+master playlist pair, and a
// DASH MPD) rather than one file, so a packager or CDN origin can be pointed at out_dir directly.
// meta.hls_fallback_51 additionally writes the object-stripped 5.1 companion rendition into a
// bed51/ subdirectory and lists it in the same #EXT-X-MEDIA group as the JOC one, which is what
// Apple's HLS Authoring Specification asks for alongside CHANNELS="<N>/JOC" - see
// iclforge::ac3::io::strip_objects. Ignored for a stream with no object layer.

// Same shape as run_mkv: wraps as an MPEG-2 Transport Stream. `profile` selects which registry
// identifies the stream in the PMT - "dvb" (the default: stream_type 0x06 plus ETSI EN 300 468
// Annex D's AC3_descriptor/enhanced_AC-3_descriptor) or "atsc" (stream_type 0x81/0x87 plus
// A/52:2018 Annex A/Annex G's own descriptors). Everything either descriptor says about the

// The inverse of the four above (container readers (mkv/mp4/ts)): reads a container and writes the bare
// AC-3/E-AC-3 elementary stream inside it, which is what every other command in this CLI takes
// as input. The container is identified by its own magic bytes, not by the file name - a .mkv
// that is really something else, or a rip with no extension at all, is the normal case here.
//
// Streams, unlike the wrapping commands: those read an elementary stream a user encoded
// moments ago, while this one is pointed at a disc rip or a broadcast capture that can run to
// gigabytes. The container reader is fed in fixed-size chunks and each access unit is written
// as it comes out, so peak memory is a chunk plus a frame whatever the file's duration.

// Container-to-container remux (container readers (mkv/mp4/ts)): reads any of the three containers above (or a
// bare elementary stream) and writes any of the three below, picking the target by `out_path`'s
// extension since there is nothing else to pick it by - unlike sniffing the INPUT, a file that
// does not exist yet has no bytes to identify it from. Everything the target container declares
// still comes straight off the re-scanned bitstream (run_mkv/run_mp4/run_ts's own comments), never
// off whatever the source container said, which is what makes this the dec3-repair case the old
// Atmos dec3 repair remux cited: a .mkv with a broken or missing Atmos dec3 flag remuxed to .mp4 gets a correct
// one, because the target's dec3 was never read from the source at all. `profile` is passed
// through to run_ts unchanged when the target is a Transport Stream and ignored otherwise.
