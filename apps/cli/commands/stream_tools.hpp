// The stream tools: commands that operate on an ALREADY-encoded
// AC-3/E-AC-3 elementary stream rather than on PCM.
//
// Two of the three never touch the audio at all. 'metadata' and 'normalize'
// rewrite bsi fields in place and re-stamp the CRCs (iclforge::ac3::io::metadata_edit),
// so a delivery correction costs no coding generation; 'cut' and 'cat' work
// on whole access units, so the bytes they keep are byte-for-byte the bytes
// that went in. 'transcode' is the one that does re-encode, because DD+ and
// DD are different codecs and nothing else can bridge them - it carries the
// metadata across rather than resetting it. It alone also reads and writes
// AC-4.
//
// Split into its own file rather than added to decode.hpp/containers.hpp for
// the reason the H4 monolith split gives generally: these five share a
// subject (an encoded stream in, an encoded stream out) that none of the
// existing groups has.

// things first - the bytes, and what the bitstream says it is - and reports
// the same two failures, so this is read once and shared rather than each
// command re-reading and re-scanning its own file. 'play' (play/monitor follow mode)
// shares it too, for its sink-following fallback - see decode_and_render.

// for each one with how many of its samples are the programme's: all of them
// but in the last. `coded_channels` sizes the buffers `on_frame` receives -
// independent of the SOURCE's own channel count, which this reads off
// `loaded.scan` itself.
//
// `on_frame` does whatever the caller wants with the rendered PCM - encode
// it (run_transcode), re-encode and passthrough it, or decode straight to
// MonitorSink ('play', play/monitor follow mode) - and returns false to abort, already
// reported by then; this just unwinds without reporting anything further.
// `on_abort` is called instead for the DECODE side's own failure (a
// mid-stream channel count change no one routing can describe), before
// `on_frame` would run again for it - the default no-op suits a caller with
// nothing partially written that needs unwinding, unlike run_transcode's own
// EncodedStreamSink.
//
// Returns nullopt on any failure (already reported to stderr, from here or
// from `on_frame`/`on_abort`'s own caller).
