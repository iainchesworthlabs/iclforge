# Creates and starts the Crucible tray-crash guest in VMware Workstation: a
# Debian 13 (trixie) desktop that provisions itself from a cloud-init seed,
# with a StatusNotifier host on its panel, Qt 6.8, the Crucible build
# dependencies, Qt's own debug symbols, gdb and valgrind. See README.md.
#
#   .\New-TrayTestVm.ps1
#
# Trixie because it carries Qt 6.8.2, which is the Qt the Raspberry Pi the
# crash was measured on carries, and because Debian publishes matching
# -dbgsym packages for it - which is the thing a 2 GB Pi could not give
# (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, "The tray, and why Linux does not get one").
#
# Unlike the Windows guest next door this one runs no installer. The
# published cloud image is a partition table and a root filesystem, so the
# work here is to turn 3 GB of raw bytes into a VMware disk, grow it, and
# hand cloud-init a seed CD that does the rest on first boot.
