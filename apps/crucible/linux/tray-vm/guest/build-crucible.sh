# Builds crucible inside the guest from the tree Sync-Source.ps1 pushed
# to ~/src, optionally with one of the two edits this VM exists to measure.
#
#   crucible-build                 the window as it ships
#   crucible-build --tray          force the tray on where the seam says no
#   crucible-build --nest-submenu  put a submenu back in the tray's menu -
#                                  the reproducer for the Qt bug
#   crucible-build --nest-submenu --asan   the same, with AddressSanitizer
#
# Both edits are applied here rather than committed, and reverted from a
# pristine copy on every run, so the shipped source in ~/src never drifts:
# what the tree says is what the tree says, and this only ever changes what
# is on this VM.
#
# --nest-submenu is the one that matters now. QDBusPlatformMenu implements no
# createSubMenu(), so a Qt.labs Menu nested inside a tray icon's menu gets Qt
# Labs Platform's QWidget fallback and is then static_cast to the D-Bus one;
# the panel's first GetLayout reads it as the wrong type and the window dies,
# nine or ten launches in ten. The tray menu is flat because of it, and this
# flag is what shows that the constraint is still real.
#
# --asan instruments Crucible, not Qt. That is still worth having: ASan's
# allocator replaces glibc's process-wide, so a use-after-free or an overflow
# of memory *we* allocated is caught even when the bad access happens inside
# Qt, and every report carries the allocating and freeing stacks. For a fault
# inside Qt's own objects, though, valgrind (crucible-trials --valgrind) is
# the better tool and needs no rebuild - it is what found this one.
