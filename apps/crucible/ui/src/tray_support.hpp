// Whether this build publishes a system tray icon, and what to say when it
// does not. A platform seam like ui/platform/<os>/app_icon_provider.cpp: one
// file per operating system, exactly one compiled, no #ifdefs
// (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, "The platform tree").
//
// The question is whether this session has somewhere to put an icon, and Qt
// answers it: QSystemTrayIcon::isSystemTrayAvailable(). All three platforms
// ask it and none adds anything, which is what a seam should look like when
// the platforms agree - the notification area, the menu bar's status area
// and a StatusNotifier host are the same question asked of three desktops.
//
// It has not always. Linux answered a flat no for a while, because
// publishing an item killed the window - the Linux file has that record,
// which is still worth reading: the constraint it leaves behind is that the
// tray's menu in Main.qml must not nest a submenu.
