// The macOS AppIconProvider: an application's icon from its bundle, through
// NSWorkspace (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, Phase 5).
//
// **THIS RUNS ON CI, AND ON NOBODY'S DESK.** Written 2026-09-06 without a
// Mac; since the same day tst_icons.qml creates AppIcon items on both macOS
// legs, so requestImage() below answers for real
// (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, Phase 5). What no test can check is whether
// what it drew is the right icon: the suite asserts that an image came back,
// not what is in it, and nobody has looked at one.
//
// Objective-C++ because NSWorkspace and NSImage have no C entry point, the
// same wall engine/src/platform/macos/foreground.mm hits. The file's path is what
// says "macOS"; there is no #ifdef here, and
// tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1 holds that rule for the whole of
// apps/ (its extension list gained .mm on 2026-09-06, with these two files).
//
// Half the Qt includes below are read AFTER the AppKit import, which matters
// more than it looks: AppKit reaches Apple's <AssertMacros.h> through
// ApplicationServices, and that header defines a one-parameter macro called
// verify() while Qt's own qbytearray.h/qstring.h/qlist.h/qspan.h declare and
// call a two-parameter member verify(pos, n). A Qt header first read after the
// import would fail on that. The build defines
// __ASSERT_MACROS_DEFINE_VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UNDERSCORES=0 for this target
// (apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt and ui/tests/CMakeLists.txt), which is Apple's
// own opt-out, so the order below is safe rather than lucky - but it is safe
// because of that define and not on its own.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The rungs
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// macOS has a single call for "the icon this thing has" where Linux has none -
// -[NSWorkspace iconForFile:] hands back exactly what the Finder shows - so
// there are three rungs here rather than Linux's four, the first that yields a
// picture winning:
//
//   1. The .app bundle. The session monitor puts the OUTERMOST bundle in
//      image_path where a process has one (engine/src/platform/macos/
//      process_facts.hpp's icon_path_of, over bundle_facts.hpp), so a
//      browser's audio helper arrives here as the browser and gets the
//      browser's icon rather than a helper binary's.
//   2. The bundle identifier, through
//      -[NSWorkspace URLForApplicationWithBundleIdentifier:]. This is the rung
//      for a process whose executable path could not be read at all -
//      proc_pidpath fails with EPERM across a user boundary - while Core Audio
//      still named its bundle.
//   3. Nothing: a null image, and the monogram stays.
//
// **There is deliberately no rung for a bare executable.** iconForFile: on a
// Unix binary outside a bundle answers with the shell's generic executable
// icon, which is a worse picture than the monogram and is the same picture for
// every such process. The Windows provider fetches its own generic icon once
// and compares pixel for pixel to reject it; here the test is cheaper, because
// a path that is not a bundle is knowable without asking anybody - it does not
// end in ".app" - so it is never asked. A command-line player gets the
// monogram, which is the right answer for it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Which thread may touch what - the same rule as the Linux provider, for a
// different reason, and it is not optional
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The constructor runs on the GUI thread. Every request arrives on Qt Quick's
// pixmap-reader thread, because this provider asks for
// ForceAsynchronousImageLoading; the id is parsed and the bundle-or-identifier
// decision made there, and neither touches AppKit.
//
// **AppKit is main-thread-only, and that is the whole of the discipline
// here.** NSWorkspace's icon lookups and NSImage's drawing both reach AppKit's
// process-wide state, which Apple documents as usable from the main thread
// alone; NSGraphicsContext's current-context stack is per-thread but the
// image being drawn is not. So the lookup and the draw run on the GUI thread,
// one queued call per new identity, which the reader thread waits on - exactly
// what ui/src/platform/linux/app_icon_provider.cpp does for QIconLoader, whose own
// reason is different (one process-wide set of caches with no lock) and whose
// consequence is identical.
//
// The wait is bounded rather than a blocking connection, and for the reason
// the Linux file gives: the reader thread's own destructor, at engine
// teardown, runs on the GUI thread and waits for the reader, so a reader
// blocked on that same GUI thread would never return. On a timeout the answer
// is null and is NOT cached, so the next request asks again. The posted call
// owns its inputs and the slot for its answer through a shared block, so a
// call that outlives this wait writes into memory nobody reads any more. The
// frame thread never touches any of it.

// An NSImage as a QImage of exactly px by px, drawn rather than copied.
//
// NSImage is a resolution-independent set of representations, not a bitmap, so
// there is nothing to memcpy out of it: the way to get pixels is to draw it
// into a context whose format you chose. That context is a CGBitmapContext
// over the QImage's own scanlines, so there is one buffer and no intermediate
// copy.
//
// The pixel format pairs QImage::Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied with
// kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst | kCGBitmapByteOrder32Host. QImage's ARGB32
// is one native-endian 32-bit word per pixel with alpha in the top byte, which
// is what "alpha first, host byte order" names on the CoreGraphics side; both
// macOS architectures are little-endian, so the host order resolves the same
// way on each. Premultiplied on both sides, so no conversion pass is needed
// after the draw.
//
// **Orientation is the thing most likely to be wrong here, so here is the
// reasoning rather than a result.** A CGBitmapContext draws in a coordinate
// system whose origin is the lower left, while its backing memory begins with
// the image's TOP row - CoreGraphics maps user y = height to row 0 - and a
// QImage's scanline 0 is its top row too. So an image drawn upright in that
// coordinate system lands top row first in memory and reads upright as a
// QImage, with no transform applied: `flipped:NO` on the NSGraphicsContext
// says the context is the unflipped one it actually is, and the CTM is left
// alone. Qt's own qt_mac_cg_context() flips the CTM instead, because the Qt
// code after it paints in Qt's top-left coordinates, and then flips a second
// time inside qt_mac_drawCGImage() to put the picture back the right way up;
// two flips and none are the same picture. Nobody has looked at an icon this
// produced. If they come out upside down on a Mac, this paragraph is the one
// that was wrong and a CTM translate-and-scale is the fix.
