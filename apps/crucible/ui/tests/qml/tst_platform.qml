//
// Three of them live here. The tray, which asks Qt the same question on every
// platform, and whose menu must stay flat for a reason the Linux file
// records. The silent device, whose name and whose advice are the platform's
// own words and were Windows' words everywhere on the first Linux run. And
// the listing rule, the sentence the room shows about which applications
// appear in it, which the platforms disagree about because they are really
// different.
//
// A third platform joined on 2026-09-06 and none of it has run. macOS's arms
// below assert the sentences and the flags its seams return, which is what a
// suite can hold without a machine; nothing here has been executed on a Mac,
// and passing on the macOS CI leg would say that the seams say what they were
// written to say and nothing about whether any of it works
// (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, "What cannot be verified, and why").
//
// Nothing here starts the engine or touches an audio device, and nothing
// installs or creates anything: install()/create is what puts a real node in
// a real graph, and a test may not.
