//   stage, the signing hook, the encoder, the device watcher, the session
//   monitor's thread. None of it enumerates or opens anything, so on a
//   working machine it is over in microseconds and this deadline is pure
//   headroom. A worker that has not got here has stopped inside a platform
//   call that is not coming back, and saying so is the point: a window that
//   hangs on start is worse than one that says it could not start
//   (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, Phase 5, where a macOS platform call that
//   never returned became a frozen window rather than a refusal).
//
//   kProbeDeadline covers the first probe's verdict, which is what says
//   whether this machine has anything that will take the stream. Running
//   out of it is NOT a refusal, and that asymmetry is deliberate: PipeWire
//   spends up to two seconds per endpoint (src/audio/src/backend/pipewire/
//   passthrough.cpp, kProbeTimeoutSeconds), so the machines slow to answer
//   are exactly the ones that have endpoints to answer with, while a
//   machine with nothing to probe answers at once. Giving up here reports
//   started, and the mode and reason reach the UI through the status
//   snapshot as they always have.
//

// Linux start blocks the caller for at most kProbeDeadline, and a wedged
// platform call is refused after kBuildDeadline instead of never.

    //     on a machine where the policy lands on kNone, Crucible would mute

    //     are both pure captures: the application is heard the same whether
