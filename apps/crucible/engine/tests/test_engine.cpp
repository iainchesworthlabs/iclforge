// The engine's frame loop over the three seams EngineConfig injects
// (apps/crucible/engine/engine.hpp): it starts, it brings the output stage
// up on the endpoint the policy chose, it taps every application the
// session monitor lists, and it stops.
//
// The stop case is the one with a bug behind it. The probe runs
// `output->enumerate()` on its own thread and was never joined, so a stop
// that landed while an enumeration was in flight destroyed the OutputStage
// out from under the thread inside it (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, "the
// probe thread outlived what it was enumerating"). `loop()` now joins the
// probe before it stops the watcher or the output, which makes the ordering
// observable from here: with an enumeration parked, `stop()` must not
// return until it is let go. The use-after-free itself only fires under a
// sanitizer, so the CI leg that would report it as a memory error is
// config-linux-llvm-asan-ubsan (CMakePresets.json's sanitize-asan-ubsan
// base); what this file pins on every leg is the wait, which is the fix's
// whole shape.
//
// The three cases after it hold a second rule of the same loop: a tap is
// opened only while the output stage has an endpoint to play to. See
// Impl::sync_taps() in apps/crucible/engine/engine.cpp for why that matters
// on macOS, where the Core Audio process tap mutes the application it taps,
// and why it changes nothing audible on Windows or Linux, where a tap is a
// pure capture.
//
// The last holds a third rule of the same loop, and the reason the stop case
// above can now ask once: a re-probe that arrives while an enumeration is
// running is kept for the next frame, not spent on the one in flight.
//
// Every case here carries [concurrency], so the ThreadSanitizer leg reaches
// them through `ctest -L concurrency` (tests/CMakeLists.txt's note on the
// label). The engine is the shape that label is for: three threads - the
// frame loop, the session monitor and the probe - over three mutexes, four
// atomics and an OutputStage, none of which any other gate can see into. The
// probe's own arming is the sharpest of them, and unlocked on purpose: the
// frame loop reads `probing` and then takes `want_reprobe`, which is safe
// only because it is the sole reader of the one and the sole writer that
// sets the other true (engine.cpp's own comment says so). That is an
// argument, and this is the leg that checks it.
//
// Every thread here is this project's own code. The one platform thread the
// engine would start is the device watcher's, and on the Linux legs that is
// the ALSA backend, which refuses start() with kNoBackend and starts nothing
// - so no uninstrumented library runs here and tsan.supp stays as empty as
// its own header asks it to be.
//
// test_engine_start.cpp is deliberately NOT on that leg, though it drives
// the same engine: its cases assert that frames flow within two seconds,
// which is an upper bound on how long the engine may take. TSan would break
// that, and widening it to survive would delete the thing it checks. The
// deadlines here are the other kind - a lower bound on stop(), and polls
// that a slow run only reaches sooner than their limit.
