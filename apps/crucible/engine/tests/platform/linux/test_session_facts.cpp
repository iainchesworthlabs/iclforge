// The Linux SessionMonitor's bookkeeping, with no PipeWire daemon in the room
// (apps/crucible/engine/platform/linux/proc_facts.hpp, and session_monitor.cpp
// beside it for what stays behind the daemon). Four things live here and none
// of them needs a session:
//
// parse_ppid(), the /proc/<pid>/stat rule. The field a browser breaks is the
// comm, which the kernel prints in parentheses and does not escape, so the
// parse has to start from the LAST ')'. A stat line is also the one thing
// here a test can write out in full.
//
// The /proc readers, against a directory this file writes rather than against
// the machine's own /proc: a test that asserted anything about the processes
// that happen to be running would be asserting about the runner.
//
// ProcessFactsCache: that /proc is read once per process, that the identity a
// stream carries back-fills what an earlier stream left empty and never the
// other way round, and that facts for processes that have gone are dropped.
//
// The two records a refresh builds - the sounding one and the kept one - and
// the fill a second stream from one process does to the first's entry.
//
// Linux only, by tests/CMakeLists.txt, the way test_x11_foreground.cpp is:
// the file under test lives in a platform directory and is compiled nowhere
// else. What cannot be reached from here is the refresh() around it, which
// needs a graph to walk; tools/checks/crucible_platform_probe.cpp is what
// exercises that, by hand, on hardware.
