// The platform seams (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, Phase 2a). Two things are
// worth holding here, and neither needs a device, a window manager or a
// driver, which is the point of the seams existing.
//
// The first is the promise platform_services.hpp makes: every factory returns
// a working object, never null. Callers above the seam dereference these
// without checking, on the rule that a platform which cannot do something
// says so through its own support()/state() rather than by being absent. On
// a Linux CI leg the definitions linked here are the stub's, so this is a
// test of the production fallback and not only of a fake.
//
// The second is that "cannot tell" and "nothing is full-screen" stay
// different answers. Wayland gives a client no way to ask about another
// client's windows, so its Foreground reports no pid *and* an unavailable
// support(); a UI that read the missing pid alone would silently drop the
// full-screen rule instead of explaining why it cannot apply it.
