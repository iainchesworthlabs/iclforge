// The slot plan: how the demo spends the encoder's fifteen dynamic objects
// (docs/platforms/windows-demo.md, "Objects and the bed").
//
// AtmosEncoder has no bed input of its own - its 5.1 bed is rendered FROM
// the objects - so the bed is five of the fifteen, pinned to the L, R, C, Ls
// and Rs speaker positions with snap set, and the other ten are what
// positioned applications get. The count is fixed at construction and never
// changes mid-stream: an application that leaves the bed takes the lowest
// free positioned slot, one that returns to the bed frees it, and idle slots
// carry silence.
//
// Platform-independent by construction (an AppId is just a number the
// platform layer chose - a process id on Windows), so it is tested on every
// CI leg, not only the one that can run the demo.
