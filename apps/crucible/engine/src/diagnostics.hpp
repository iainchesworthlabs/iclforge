// The diagnostics file (docs/crucible/troubleshooting.md, "Saving a
// diagnostics file"): a bounded ring of one-line notes that the engine, the
// window's Qt message handler and the controller write to, and a renderer
// that turns named facts, an engine snapshot and the ring into plain text.
//
// The rule this module exists to hold: the file never carries the signing
// key, the path to the key file, or the value of any environment variable.
// It is held twice. First structurally - the report is composed from named
// fields, and there is no field for the key bytes, the key path (whether
// chosen in Settings or given through ICLFORGE_SIGNING_KEY_FILE) or the
// inline ICLFORGE_SIGNING_KEY value; EngineStatus::signing (which names the
// key file for the Settings page) and AppStatus::image_path (a path inside
// the person's profile) are never read; the settings section is a fixed list
// of keys the caller whitelists, and any key under "signing/" is written as
// withheld whatever value arrived with it; the environment is never
// enumerated. Second, as a belt and braces for text that arrived through the
// message ring: the finished report is passed through scrub(), which replaces
// every spelling of the key path and of the inline key value.
//
// A future protected key store (docs/crucible/install.md promises one) must
// live under the "signing/" settings prefix so the renderer's rule covers it
// without a code change.
//
// No Qt, no platform header and no fmt here: the engine's threads write to
// the ring, the console runner can reuse the renderer, and iclforge-tests holds
// the rule on every CI leg.
