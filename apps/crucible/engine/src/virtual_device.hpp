// The silent device: whether this machine has one, whether applications are
// playing into it, and how one is installed or removed
// (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, "The silent device, per platform").
//
// This is the seam whose Windows shape most needed generalising. It was
// `driver_tools.hpp` and it spoke about drivers, test signing and elevated
// PowerShell - none of which exists on the other two platforms. What the UI
// actually needs to know is smaller and platform-neutral: is there a device
// that discards what it is given, are applications playing to it, and can
// this application do anything about it. That is what `SilentDeviceState`
// carries, and the platform-specific detail lives in `blocker` and `detail`
// as text the UI prints rather than as fields it has to reason about.
//
// The three answers differ:
//
// **Windows** needs a kernel driver, because Windows has no user-mode way to
// create a render endpoint. `install()` runs the package's script elevated.
// While the driver is test-signed the machine must also have test signing on
// and memory integrity off, which is what `blocker` says when it cannot load.
//
// **Linux** needs no driver: the silent device is a PipeWire
// `support.null-audio-sink` node this application creates and tears down, so
// `install()` needs no elevation and cannot fail for signing reasons.
//
// **macOS** needs no silent device at all. Its process taps mute each
// application at the point they tap it, so `needed` is false, `present` is
// meaningless, and the UI shows the tap's consent state instead.

// VirtualDevice all read this one constant. The INF's strings, the guest scripts and the Crucible
// tests carry the same words, and tools/n1b/n1d_driver_names.py changes every one of them in a
