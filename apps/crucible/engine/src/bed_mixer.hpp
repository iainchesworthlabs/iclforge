// Folding what a tap delivers into what a slot takes
// (docs/platforms/windows-demo.md, "Objects and the bed").
//
// A tap arrives interleaved at the channel count the tap was opened with -
// two for most applications, eight for one that renders surround into the
// 7.1 null sink. A positioned application becomes one mono object; a bed
// application is summed into the five bed slots by channel. Both are plain
// arithmetic on interleaved float, with no allocation once the outputs are
// sized, so they can run on the engine's frame thread.
//
// Channel orders assumed, all WASAPI's (which are WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE's, which
// are SMPTE's): 2 = L R; 4 = L R Ls Rs; 6 = L R C LFE Ls Rs; 8 = L R C LFE
// Lss Rss Lrs Rrs. Anything else is summed to mono and spread front left and
// right, which keeps it audible without pretending to know where it goes.
//
// The LFE of a surround tap is dropped, as ITU-R BS.775's downmixes drop it:
// an object cannot carry someone else's LFE (lfe_send routes the object's own
// signal), and folding it into the fronts would put bass where a bass-managed
// receiver has already decided it does not belong.
