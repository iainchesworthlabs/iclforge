// One process-loopback tap per application, kept in step with the session
// list (docs/platforms/windows-demo.md, "Routing: two problems, not one").
//
// Every tap is opened at the same shape - 48 kHz, `channels` wide - so the
// engine can read the same number of frames from each per encode frame. The
// taps are wall-clock silence-filled by the library, so a quiet application
// still advances; one that has stalled (its process gone, and the OS still
// delivering zeros, or a tap that simply has not caught up) is read as
// silence rather than holding the frame. The taps come from an
// AudioDevices (audio_devices.hpp): WASAPI in the app, fakes in the tests.
