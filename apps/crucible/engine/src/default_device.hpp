// The system default render endpoint - reading it, moving it to the silent
// device, and putting it back on exit: the seam between the application and
// the platform's audio policy (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, "The seams to
// extract").
//
// The three platforms differ in a way this interface has to carry rather
// than hide.
//
// **Windows** documents no API for setting the default. Every
// default-switcher uses IPolicyConfig::SetDefaultEndpoint, stable since
// Vista and declared by hand because no SDK header has it. Being unsupported,
// a refusal is not an error: open_sound_settings() is the fallback and the
// DeviceWatcher reports the change once the user makes it by hand.
//
// **Linux** sets the `default.audio.sink` metadata key through PipeWire,
// which is documented and needs no elevation.
//
// **macOS** never moves the default at all. Its process taps silence each
// application where they tap it (CATapDescription's mutedWhenTapped), so
// there is no silent device to point at and nothing to restore. Its
// implementation reports the default for display and refuses set_default()
// with a reason saying why it does not need to - which the UI shows in place
// of a button, rather than offering an action that would do nothing.
