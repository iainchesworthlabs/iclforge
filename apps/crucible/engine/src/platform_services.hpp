// The one place the application asks for the machine it is running on.
//
// Exactly one platform/<os>/services.cpp defines these, chosen by CMake the
// way libs/audio/src/backend/<os>/ is chosen for the library
// (docs/platforms/raspberry-pi.md, "Why there's no Raspberry Pi-specific
// code"). Nothing above this header names an operating system, and no
// #ifdef selects between them: a platform is a directory.
//
// Each returns a working object on every platform, never null. Where a
// platform cannot do something - Wayland cannot say what is full-screen,
// macOS has no silent device to install - the object returned says so
// through its own support()/state() rather than being absent, so the UI can
// explain the gap instead of the code having to test for a hole.
//
// apps/crucible/engine/tests/platform_services_stub.cpp provides the same five for a
// build with no platform half at all, which is what lets the engine's tests
// run on a Linux CI leg that has no audio hardware.
