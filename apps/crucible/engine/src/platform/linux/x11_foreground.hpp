// The X11 half of the Linux Foreground (foreground.cpp), split in two so the
// policy is tested without a display: X11WindowReader answers one question -
// what is the active window, is it full-screen, whose is it - and
// X11Foreground decides when to connect, what a lost display means, and what
// support() says meanwhile. Exactly one reader is compiled
// (apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt): xcb_window_reader.cpp over libxcb, or
// no_xcb_window_reader.cpp when the build was configured without it, whose
// connect() says so. No X header is named here; only the xcb reader has one.
