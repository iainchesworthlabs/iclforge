// The Linux twin of the Windows session monitor's root_of()
// (engine/src/platform/windows/session_monitor.cpp): a pid and every ancestor
// that runs the same executable, nearest first.
//
// The engine's full-screen rule matches the window's process against each
// application's session_pids (engine.cpp, refresh_sessions). A browser's
// window belongs to its main process while its audio comes from a utility
// process underneath, so an application listed by its stream's pid needs
// its same-image ancestors listed with it, or the rule never sees the
// browser go full-screen. Stopping where the executable changes is what
// keeps a terminal that launched a player from being the player: a
// full-screen xterm whose child is pw-play is xterm, and pw-play stays where
// it was placed.
//
// Bounded at sixteen hops, as the Windows walk is: parent ids are recycled
// and a stale chain can loop. The readers are injected so the walk is
// tested against a tree built by hand rather than against /proc
// (apps/crucible/engine/tests/platform/linux/test_x11_foreground.cpp).

// `ppid_of(pid)`: the parent, or nullopt when the process has gone.
// `exe_of(pid)`: the executable's path, or empty when it cannot be read
// (gone, or another user's), which ends the walk.
