// What the Linux SessionMonitor knows about a process, where it reads it, and
// the bookkeeping it does with it. session_monitor.cpp's own header comment is
// where the PipeWire half is explained - why the process id is on the Client
// and not on the stream node, and why an application is here only while it is
// playing; none of that is repeated here.
//
// Split out of that file so it can be tested at all. session_monitor.cpp
// includes pipewire_support.hpp, which includes <pipewire/pipewire.h>, so
// nothing in it compiles without the PipeWire development headers and nothing
// links without libpipewire - while none of what is below needs either. The
// same split process_tree.hpp already is, and the walk it holds is driven from
// here: a Catch2 case on any Linux machine exercises this, while the CI leg
// that installs PipeWire deliberately runs no tests at all
// (.github/workflows/_build.yml, the Crucible pass).
//
// The /proc readers take the directory to read from, defaulting to /proc.
// That is what lets a test hand them one it wrote itself - a comm holding a
// space, a stat line whose comm holds a ')', a pid with no exe link across a
// sandbox boundary - rather than depending on whichever processes happen to
// be running on the machine, which is the one thing a test cannot choose. It
// is the same reason process_tree.hpp injects its two readers.
