// The Linux SessionMonitor: who is playing sound, from the PipeWire graph
// (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, Phase 4).
//
// What is left in this file is the PipeWire half. Everything that is not -
// the /proc readers, the per-process fact cache and its back-fill, and the
// two records a refresh builds - lives in proc_facts.hpp beside this file,
// because this translation unit cannot be compiled at all without the
// PipeWire headers and none of that needs them. That is what
// tests/crucible/platform/linux/test_session_facts.cpp drives; what is left
// here needs a running daemon and is checked by hand on hardware with
// tools/checks/crucible_platform_probe.cpp.
//
// This is where Linux and Windows differ most, and the difference is a
// simplification rather than a gap.
//
// Windows has to group audio sessions **by process tree**, because the
// session's process is usually not the application - a browser renders its
// audio from a utility process under the browser - so it walks parents until
// the image name changes. PipeWire needs none of that for grouping: the
// process that owns a stream is the one a person means, so an application
// here is one process id, the stream's, and that is the pid the tap targets
// (capture.cpp matches it exactly).
//
// The same walk does exist here, for matching only. The engine's full-screen
// rule compares the front window's pid with each application's
// session_pids, and a browser's window belongs to its main process while its
// audio comes from the utility process listed here; so session_pids carries
// the stream's pid and every same-executable ancestor of it
// (process_tree.hpp), and `app` stays the stream's pid. Nothing is grouped
// by root: two utility processes of one browser remain two entries, as
// before.
//
// Finding that process id is not where it looks, though. A
// Stream/Output/Audio node carries application.name, media.class and a
// client.id - and no pid at all. The process is on the **Client** object the
// client.id names, where the daemon records it from the socket credentials
// as pipewire.sec.pid. Reading application.process.id off the node, which is
// the obvious thing, matches nothing and yields an empty list for ever.
// iclforge::pipewire::output_stream_nodes() does the join.
//
// Those credentials name the application only where the application talks to
// the daemon itself. An application using the PulseAudio API - which on a
// desktop is most of them - reaches it through pipewire-pulse, and its
// Client carries pipewire-pulse's pid, so believing the credentials there
// collapses every one of them into a single entry named after the relay and
// points the tap at a process that plays nothing. output_stream_nodes()
// handles it and says how; what arrives here is one pid per application,
// relayed or not.
//
// The icon's identity comes the same way. Neither application.icon-name nor
// application.process.binary is on the registry dictionary a listener is
// handed; both are on the node's info, and a Flatpak client's portal app id
// on its Client's, so output_stream_nodes() binds each stream and its client
// for their info and hands the three back beside the pid. They are cached
// here per process with the /proc facts, and back-filled when a later stream
// from the same process carries what the first did not.
//
// One more thing differs, and it is visible rather than internal: an
// application is here only while it is playing. Windows keeps an audio
// session for as long as the application holds the device open, so a paused
// media player stays in the list; PipeWire has no session, only a stream,
// and a player that is not playing has no node in the graph at all. So
// applications appear when they start making sound and leave when they stop,
// and there is nothing to be done about it from this side. The empty list
// says so (Room.qml) rather than leaving a person wondering.
//
// What is lost with it is Windows' `has_window` test, which asks the shell
// whether some process in the tree owns a visible top-level window. There is
// no portable way to ask that on Linux and no way at all under Wayland (see
// foreground.cpp for the same wall). Anything with an audio stream is
// therefore reported as an application: a background process that plays
// sound is rare on a desktop, and listing one is a smaller error than hiding
// a real application would be. The Behaviour setting that hides background
// applications simply has nothing to hide here.
