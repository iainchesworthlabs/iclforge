// The macOS SessionMonitor: who is playing sound, from Core Audio's own list
// of the processes using the HAL (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, Phase 5).
//
// **THIS RUNS ON CI, AND ON NOBODY'S DESK.** Written 2026-09-06 against
// Apple's documentation for the AudioProcess object class, with no Mac to
// try it on. It stopped being unexecuted the same day: the Crucible Qt Quick
// suites that do NOT install the scripted machine start the engine on both
// macOS legs, so refresh() below is called every 500 ms there and the HAL
// really does hand back a process list - it listed at least one process on a
// hosted runner, which is how the engine got as far as asking for a tap and
// finding the hang recorded in docs/crucible/design/promotion.md's Phase 5.
//
// What that does NOT establish is anything about the LIST. Nobody has looked
// at what it contained, whether the names are right, whether a paused player
// lingers, or whether the bundle grouping below puts a browser helper where
// this file says it will. The seam tests still link the stub
// (apps/crucible/engine/tests/platform_services_stub.cpp). So the sentences a person sees
// are still written to be true of the API rather than of anything observed.
//
// The mechanism. macOS 14.0 added an object class to the HAL for a process:
// kAudioHardwarePropertyProcessObjectList on the system object hands back an
// AudioObjectID per process that Core Audio is holding audio state for, and
// each of those answers three properties this needs -
// kAudioProcessPropertyPID, kAudioProcessPropertyBundleID and
// kAudioProcessPropertyIsRunningOutput. That is the whole of it: no client
// enumeration per endpoint the way Windows walks IAudioSessionManager2 on
// every render device, and no graph walk with a client join the way PipeWire
// needs, because the HAL keeps this list itself.
//
// The three properties are read through the library's own CoreAudio helpers
// (libs/audio/src/backend/macos/coreaudio_support.hpp: address(),
// get_property<T>(), CFOwned, to_utf8), reused rather than reimplemented for
// the same reason the Linux half reuses iclforge::pipewire's - a second copy of
// the two-call property idiom is a second place for it to be wrong. That is
// what the private include directory in apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt's APPLE
// arm is for.
//
// **The version floor is checked at runtime, not assumed.** The process object
// class does not exist before macOS 14.0, and CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET for
// this project is 13.3 (cmake/toolchains/macos.llvm.toolchain.cmake), so this
// binary can be launched on a system that has never had it. __builtin_available
// is the same runtime gate coreaudio_names.hpp's system_audio_tap_api_available()
// is written with, for the same reason: it is what silences
// -Wunguarded-availability under this project's -Werror, and it is a version
// test rather than a device round trip. Below the floor the list is empty and
// listing_rule() says why, rather than an empty room leaving somebody to guess.
//
// That precedent is more than a shape, and this file's header used to say
// otherwise. It was written in a worktree where nothing in src/ called
// system_audio_tap_api_available(), and concluded from that that no build had
// ever emitted a __builtin_available here. A test had, since before this
// branch: libs/audio/tests/backend/macos/test_macos_support.cpp's "this CI runner's OS
// build exposes the Core Audio tap API" calls it, and it passes on both macOS
// legs on main. Clang lowers a __builtin_available to a call into compiler-rt
// (__isPlatformVersionAtLeast), so the Homebrew clang the toolchain file picks
// does link its builtins here and the gate does answer on a hosted runner.
// What is new on this branch is that the library calls it too
// (libs/audio/src/backend/macos/capture.cpp's process_loopback_available()).
// None of that says anything about the property reads below; it says the
// version test itself is a mechanism that links and returns.
//
// How this differs from the other two, which a person can see.
//
// Windows keeps an audio session for as long as an application holds the
// device open, so a paused media player stays in the list and greys. PipeWire
// has a stream only while there is sound, so an application appears when it
// starts playing and leaves when it stops. macOS sits between the two and the
// exact placement is the thing that cannot be checked from here: the HAL holds
// a process object while a process is using audio, and
// kAudioProcessPropertyIsRunningOutput is a separate question from whether the
// object exists at all. So the rule below says both halves - listed while it
// is using the sound hardware, greyed when it is not currently playing - and
// claims nothing about how long a paused player lingers, because that is
// exactly what one launch on a Mac would settle and no launch has happened.
//
// Grouping. An entry here is one process, as on Linux, and the identity a
// person reads comes from the OUTERMOST .app bundle the process's executable
// lies in (bundle_facts.hpp says why). That is what puts a browser's audio
// helper in the room as the browser, with the browser's icon, without any
// process-tree walk: the helper's binary is a different file with a different
// name, so Windows' same-image walk would find nothing here, while the bundle
// is shared. Two helpers of one browser stay two entries, as two utility
// processes do on Linux.
//
// What the taps do, which is what a reader of this file asks next. The tap is
// written. libs/audio/src/backend/macos/process_tap.mm builds the
// CATapDescription and the aggregate device behind it, and it works as far as
// reading the tap's format. audio_backend.cpp nonetheless reports
// process_loopback NOT available, for the reason in the first bullet below.
// So the gap is no longer a
// missing translation unit. Five things stand between this list and a
// capture, none of them in this file, and the FIRST of them is the only one
// anybody has actually met:
//
//   - The tap is refused before it is created. On 2026-09-06 this path ran
//     for the first time anywhere, on the Apple Silicon CI leg, and
//     AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID on the tap's aggregate device never
//     returned - taking the rest of the process's Core Audio with it, so the
//     window froze rather than reporting a failed tap. The backend now says
//     process_loopback is unavailable and refuses before that call
//     (libs/audio/src/backend/macos/coreaudio_names.hpp). So the room lists
//     applications here and taps none of them. The four below are what was
//     EXPECTED to be in the way and have not been reached; each is still
//     real, and each is still unchecked.
//
//   - The code-signing identity. Creating a tap raises a TCC consent prompt
//     of its own (SystemAudioCaptureRequests), keyed to the requesting
//     binary's signature, and per every report surveyed it never fires at all
//     for an unsigned binary - which is what Crucible ships as today
//     (ROADMAP.md DR6, blocked on certificates). A denial and a prompt that
//     never appeared arrive identically, as one refusal from
//     AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap. Worth flagging that the one run there has
//     been did NOT hit this: an unsigned binary with no usage-description key
//     got a tap back. Whether that generalises past a hosted runner is
//     unknown, so the paragraph stays.
//   - The Info.plist key. That prompt is driven by
//     NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription, and this application's bundle declares
//     none: apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt's APPLE arm sets MACOSX_BUNDLE and
//     the .icns and takes CMake's default Info.plist template, which has no
//     such key. apps/forge/gui/packaging/macos/Info.plist.in is the precedent for supplying one.
//   - The channel count. A CATapDescription's mixdown descriptions are mono
//     and stereo, so the backend refuses anything else with
//     kFormatUnsupported. TapPool opens at stereo and widens only to follow a
//     null sink's width, and this platform has no null sink, so what the
//     engine asks for here is inside that - a ceiling rather than a present
//     refusal, and the reason a surround-rendering application's bed cannot
//     arrive by channel here the way it does on Windows.
//   - The sample rate. A mixdown tap runs at the rate of the device it mixes
//     down to, and the backend refuses a rate its tap does not already
//     deliver rather than resampling to it. TapPool asks for 48000
//     unconditionally, so a machine whose output device sits at 44.1 kHz
//     would have every tap refused.
//
// None of those four has been observed either way. docs/platforms/macos.md's
// "Per-application capture: the Core Audio process tap" carries the whole of
// it, including both figures in circulation for the version floor.
