// What the macOS SessionMonitor knows about a process beyond what Core Audio
// tells it, where it reads it, and the bookkeeping it does with it.
// session_monitor.cpp's own header is where the Core Audio half is explained -
// which property list is walked and what a person will see in it; none of that
// is repeated here.
//
// **NOTHING IN THIS FILE HAS BEEN RUN.** Written 2026-09-06; the only compiler
// that will read it is the macOS CI leg, and no Mac has ever executed any part
// of this application (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, "What cannot be verified,
// and why"). Everything below is written against Apple's documented behaviour
// for proc_pidpath(2), not against behaviour anybody has watched.
//
// Split out of session_monitor.cpp the same way platform/linux/proc_facts.hpp
// is split out of its own: that file includes <CoreAudio/CoreAudio.h> and
// nothing in it compiles anywhere but a Mac, while this needs only libproc,
// which is part of libSystem and needs no link line of its own. Unlike the
// Linux file, no test drives this yet - apps/crucible/engine/tests/CMakeLists.txt has an `if(LINUX)`
// block for that platform's pure halves and no `if(APPLE)` one, and adding a
// case here that has never been run on a Mac would only assert what this file
// already says. The split is what makes writing one cheap when somebody has a
// machine; bundle_facts.hpp beside it is the part with rules worth asserting.
//
// The one read here is the executable path, because macOS gives no other
// answer this application needs:
//
//   - proc_pidpath() is the documented way to turn a pid into the path of the
//     binary behind it. There is no /proc to read and no version resource to
//     open; the bundle at the head of that path is the identity
//     (bundle_facts.hpp), and the icon provider takes the same path back
//     through the image id.
//   - It fails with EPERM for a process the caller does not own. Every
//     application a person is playing sound from is their own, so the failure
//     case here is a system process rather than something to work around, and
//     an empty path is what leaves it out of the list.
//
// There is no parent walk. The Windows monitor walks to the root of a process
// tree and the Linux one collects same-executable ancestors, both so that the
// engine's full-screen rule can match a browser's window process against its
// audio process (engine.cpp, refresh_sessions). session_pids is the ONLY
// consumer of either walk, and this platform's Foreground never answers with a
// pid at all - macOS gives an application no way to learn whether another
// application's window fills the screen, which foreground.mm states in full -
// so a walk here would be written for a caller that cannot call it. Should
// that change, the grouping to walk on is the outermost .app bundle
// (bundle_facts.hpp's app_bundle_path), not the executable name.
