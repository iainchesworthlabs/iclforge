// What a macOS process's executable path says about the application a person
// means by it: the bundle it lives in, and the name to put beside it. Pure
// string work over paths - no CoreAudio, no libproc, no AppKit - kept beside
// session_monitor.cpp for the reason platform/linux/process_tree.hpp is kept
// beside its own: the file that includes <CoreAudio/CoreAudio.h> cannot be
// compiled anywhere but a Mac, and none of what is below needs to be.
//
// **NOTHING IN THIS FILE HAS BEEN RUN.** Written 2026-09-06 against Apple's
// documented bundle layout; the only compiler that will read it is the macOS
// CI leg (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, "What cannot be verified, and why").
// The paths quoted in the comments are the documented shapes, not paths
// observed on a machine.
//
// The rule this file exists for is the macOS answer to a question Windows and
// Linux each answer differently.
//
// Windows groups audio sessions by process tree and stops where the image
// name changes: a browser's utility process and the browser share an
// executable name, so the walk finds the browser. Linux stops at the stream's
// own process, because on PipeWire the process that owns a stream is the one
// a person means.
//
// Neither rule works here. A Chromium browser's audio comes from a helper
// whose executable is a DIFFERENT binary with a different name - the
// documented layout is
//
//   /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome
//   /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Frameworks/Google Chrome
//       Framework.framework/Versions/<v>/Helpers/Google Chrome
//       Helper (Renderer).app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Helper (Renderer)
//
// so a same-image walk stops immediately and a same-name test finds nothing.
// What the two paths DO share is the outermost `.app` bundle, and that is
// what macOS itself treats as one application: it is what the Dock shows, what
// the icon belongs to, and what a person would name. So the grouping key here
// is the outermost bundle, and app_bundle_path() below is the whole of it.
//
// Outermost rather than innermost deliberately. `Google Chrome Helper
// (Renderer).app` is a bundle too, nested inside the browser's; taking the
// innermost would put a row called "Google Chrome Helper (Renderer)" in the
// room, which is the machine's word for it and not a person's.
