// The macOS Foreground: what NSWorkspace can say, and the reason it is not
// enough (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, Phase 5).
//
// **THIS RUNS ON CI, AND ON NOBODY'S DESK.** Written 2026-09-06 without a
// Mac; since the same day the Crucible Qt Quick suites start the engine on
// both macOS legs, so the session-monitor thread calls fullscreen_pid() below
// and the NSWorkspace call in it returns (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, Phase
// 5). That is the whole of what is known: it does not hang and it does not
// crash off the main thread. What it reports on a machine with a real seat in
// front of it is still unobserved.
//
// Objective-C++ because it has to be. NSWorkspace is an AppKit class with no C
// entry point, which is the same wall libs/audio/src/backend/macos/capture.cpp
// records for CATapDescription; this is the first .mm in the tree and
// apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt's APPLE arm is where OBJCXX is turned on. The
// file's path is what says "macOS" - there is no #ifdef here, and
// tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1 holds that rule for the whole of
// apps/ (its extension list gained .mm on 2026-09-06, with this file and the
// icon provider).
//
// platform_services.hpp is included after the AppKit import, so the engine's
// whole header set is read with Apple's <AssertMacros.h> already in scope.
// That header defines macros named check(), verify() and require() unless
// __ASSERT_MACROS_DEFINE_VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UNDERSCORES is 0, which this
// target's CMake sets - see the reasoning in apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt's
// APPLE arm, where the collision with Qt's own verify() is written out. No
// engine header uses those three names today; the define is what keeps that
// from being a thing anybody has to remember.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What this seam is asked, and what macOS answers
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The engine asks one question: which process owns a FULL-SCREEN window right
// now, so that a full-screen game rendering 7.1 is pinned to the bed whatever
// the person asked for (engine/foreground.hpp).
//
// macOS answers a neighbouring question and not that one.
// -[NSWorkspace frontmostApplication] names the application the user is
// working in - its pid, its bundle identifier, whether it is active. It says
// nothing about that application's windows, and AppKit gives one application
// no way to ask about another's: NSWindow, NSScreen and
// NSApplicationPresentationOptions all describe the process asking. There is
// no AppKit equivalent of _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN or of Windows'
// SHQueryUserNotificationState.
//
// So this reports no pid, and support() says which of two things is in the
// way, decided by an actual NSWorkspace call rather than assumed:
//
//   - There is a window session and something is in front of it, but macOS
//     will not say whether it fills the screen.
//   - There is no window session at all - Crucible launched from a shell over
//     ssh, or crucible-run under launchd - so there is nothing in front to
//     name either.
//
// That two-reason shape is the Linux file's (platform/linux/foreground.cpp
// separates Wayland from no-display for the same reason): the sentence a
// person is shown should say what is actually true of their machine.
//
// **Returning the frontmost pid instead would be a different claim, and a
// wrong one.** The engine takes what this returns and pins that application
// to the bed (engine.cpp, refresh_sessions -> Slots::set_fullscreen). Handing
// it whatever window has focus would silently move a person's mixer around as
// they clicked between applications, and they would be told nothing, because
// there would be nothing to tell: support() would be reporting availability.
// engine/foreground.hpp states the rule this obeys - "nothing is full-screen"
// and "this platform cannot tell" are different answers and the UI shows the
// second one.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What would answer it, for whoever has a machine
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo(kCGWindowListOptionOnScreenOnly, kCGNullWindowID)
// hands back every on-screen window's owner pid, layer and bounds, and
// CGDisplayBounds() gives each display's rectangle in the same coordinate
// space, so "the frontmost application owns a layer-0 window whose bounds are
// a whole display's" is the macOS spelling of the X11 test. It is deliberately
// not written here, on 2026-09-06, for two reasons that are about this
// machine rather than that API: the window-list calls sit in the family Apple
// has been deprecating in favour of ScreenCaptureKit, and a deprecation
// warning is a failed build under this project's -Werror - which would break
// the one thing this file can be held to, that it compiles. Nobody here can
// try it and read the result. Whoever runs Crucible on a Mac first should
// write it, check the deprecation state against the SDK in front of them, and
// then this seam's support() becomes available and its reason goes.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Threads
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// fullscreen_pid() is called from the engine's session-monitor thread at its
// 500 ms cadence, and support() from the frame thread and from the controller
// (engine.cpp; crucible_controller.cpp's diagnostics). So the reason is one
// atomic pointer to a string literal, exactly as X11Foreground keeps its own:
// a literal never goes away, so there is nothing to own and nothing to lock.
//
// -[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] is documented as usable from any thread and
// this reads one property of the object it returns. It is NOT AppKit drawing,
// which is main-thread-only; ui/src/platform/macos/app_icon_provider.mm is the
// file in this application that has that constraint, and it says so.
