// The macOS DefaultDevice: the system output, read and never moved
// (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, Phase 5).
//
// **THIS RUNS ON CI, AND ON NOBODY'S DESK.** Written 2026-09-06 without a
// Mac; since the same day the Crucible Qt Quick suites drive it for real on
// both macOS legs, and it is the file whose endpoints() showed up in the
// stack of the first hang this platform half produced
// (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, Phase 5). What has still never happened is a
// launch on a desktop Mac, so nothing here is a report of how it behaves
// beside real hardware.
//
// Two of the five answers come free, the same two Linux gets free: the
// endpoint list is the library's own enumerate_render_devices(), which is what
// the output stage already probes, and the name search over it is the same
// substring match Windows and Linux both do. The list's ids are Core Audio
// device UIDs (libs/audio/src/backend/macos/passthrough.cpp), which is what
// makes them comparable with the default read below.
//
// The default itself is one property read:
// kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice on the system object, then that
// device's UID. coreaudio_support.hpp already has both, so this file is a
// small forwarder over the library's private header rather than a second copy
// of the two-call property idiom - the reason the Linux half reuses
// iclforge::pipewire's helpers the same way.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Nothing moves the default here, and that is the point
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// moves_default() is FALSE, and it is the only one of the three platforms
// where it is.
//
// Windows and Linux both work by putting every application into a device that
// discards what it is given and tapping them there, so both have to move the
// system default and put it back afterwards. macOS does not need a silent
// device at all: a Core Audio process tap carries muteBehavior
// (.mutedWhenTapped), which silences each application AT THE POINT IT IS
// TAPPED. Nothing in a person's sound settings is touched, so there is nothing
// to move, nothing to restore on quit, and no window in which quitting badly
// leaves the machine silent.
//
// set_default() therefore refuses with a reason saying it does not need to,
// which default_device.hpp documents as not a failure.
//
// **What the UI does with that today, read on 2026-09-06 rather than assumed.**
// default_device.hpp's own text says the window "drops the whole first station
// of the signal path" when moves_default() is false. It does not, and this
// platform is the first to make that claim testable, so it is written down
// here instead of being left to be discovered on a Mac:
//
//   - FirstRunDialog.qml DOES branch, and correctly - the paragraph below
//     this one has the detail, read the same day.
//   - Every "Send applications to ..." control is DISABLED rather than hidden:
//     SignalPath.qml, OutputPage.qml and Main.qml's tray menu each gate on
//     `nullSinkPresent || silentDeviceCanCreate`, and both are false here, so
//     nothing can call moveDefaultToNullSink(). The launch-time move is behind
//     `behaviour/moveDefaultOnLaunch`, which defaults to false.
//   - SignalPath.qml's station 1 is NOT gated on movesDefault and would still
//     be drawn, with a warning telling the reader to "Send applications to the
//     silent device instead" - advice that is wrong on this platform. Recorded
//     in docs/crucible/design/promotion.md's Phase 5 "Not done" list rather than fixed
//     here: it is a QML change, and nobody can run the window to see the
//     result of one.
//
// The wording of the refusal matters, because it is printed verbatim. It says
// what this platform does instead, not what it lacks.
//
// **Checked on 2026-09-06 before relying on it:** the first-run dialog already
// reads this. apps/crucible/ui/assets/qml/FirstRunDialog.qml line 46 computes
// `movesDefault: CrucibleController.movesDefault && CrucibleController.silentDeviceNeeded`,
// and its first step renders "Applications are silenced where they are tapped"
// with the body "Nothing in your sound settings changes here: each application
// is silenced where Crucible taps it" when that is false - and hides the
// device status, the blocker line, the Send button and the restore row with
// it. CrucibleController::movesDefault() (crucible_controller.hpp) is a
// CONSTANT property over DefaultDevice::moves_default(). No QML says the word
// "macOS", and none was changed for this platform - which is right for the
// first-run dialog and is the open gap for the signal path's station 1, as the
// list above says.
//
// open_sound_settings() is a no-op. On Windows it is the fallback for an
// IPolicyConfig refusal, because there the refusal means "do it by hand"; here
// the refusal means "there is nothing to do", so sending somebody to System
// Settings would be sending them to change something this application has just
// said it does not need changed.
