// Who is playing sound, as applications rather than as streams: the seam
// between the engine and whatever the platform uses to answer that
// (docs/crucible/design/promotion.md, "The seams to extract").
//
// Every platform has some notion of it and no two agree on the shape.
// Windows reads IAudioSessionManager2 on each render endpoint and groups the
// sessions by process tree, because the session's process is often not the
// application - Chrome's audio comes from a utility process under the
// browser. Linux reads the PipeWire graph: a stream's Client carries the
// process id, and the stream node's info carries application.name and the
// icon name the application gave itself. macOS reads
// kAudioHardwarePropertyProcessObjectList. What the engine needs from all
// three is the same list, so that is what this interface is: the list, and
// nothing about how it was obtained.
//
// Polled, not event-driven, on every platform: refresh() is cheap enough to
// call a couple of times a second, which is as fast as a UI needs a new
// application to appear. The Windows implementation runs it on its own
// thread because enumerating processes and reading version resources cost
// 48 ms on the frame thread (windows-demo.md, "The application review").
