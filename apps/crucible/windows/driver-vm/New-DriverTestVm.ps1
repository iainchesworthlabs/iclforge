# Creates and starts the driver test guest in VMware Workstation:
# a throwaway Windows 11 VM that installs itself unattended (autounattend.xml)
# with test signing on and memory integrity off, so the test-signed
# IclForgeNullSink package can be loaded, crashed and rolled back without
# touching the host. See README.md.
#
#   .\New-DriverTestVm.ps1 -WindowsIso D:\ISOs\Win11_25H2_English_x64_v2.iso
#
# Attaches four virtual CDs: the Windows ISO, an ISO carrying
# autounattend.xml, an ISO carrying the built driver package and its scripts
# (the test scripts copy fresh ones from the working tree on every run, so
# this CD is a convenience for a hand-driven guest, not what is tested), and
# VMware Workstation's own Tools ISO (so first logon can install Tools, which
# is what lets vmrun run commands in the guest).

# Secure Boot deliberately off: a test-signed driver does not load under it.
# No vTPM either (Workstation would want the guest encrypted for one); the
# answer file bypasses the TPM check. Sound present so the guest has a
# normal endpoint to compare against. The PCIe root ports (pciBridge4-7)
# are what give e1000e, NVMe and xHCI their slots; without them vmware-vmx
# logs "No PCIe slot available" and crashes at power-on.
# No bios.bootOrder: that overrides the NVRAM boot entries, and Setup
# registers one to carry on from the disk after its first reboot; the
# firmware's own order tries the (empty) disk first and falls through to
# the CD, which is exactly the sequence an unattended install wants.
