// The null sink's clock: where a stream's position is and which packet is
// being consumed, as a function of wall-clock time alone.
//
// A real device's position comes from its DMA engine; this device has none,
// so the position is what a device consuming at exactly the nominal rate
// would have reached: bytes = elapsed time since Run * bytes per second.
// Packet completions follow from that (packet i is complete when the
// position reaches the end of packet i), which is what the stream's timer
// reports to ACX. That is the one piece of logic in this driver that is not
// framework plumbing, so it lives here with no kernel dependencies and is
// tested in user mode (tests/windemo/test_nullsink_position.cpp) - kernel
// code cannot be coverage-measured, this can.
//
// Times are in 100 ns units ("hns", the kernel's), taken from the caller;
// nothing here reads a clock. Unsigned 64-bit throughout: at 768,000 bytes
// per second a position needs 2^64 bytes in about 760,000 years.
