# The static tier of the driver's verification (README.md, "Analysis"):
#
#   1. Code Analysis with the WDK's driver rule set (the successor to PREfast
#      for Drivers): a rebuild with RunCodeAnalysis on, which writes one
#      *.nativecodeanalysis.xml per source file. Any defect fails the run.
#   2. CodeQL with Microsoft's windows-drivers pack: a database built from the
#      same rebuild, analysed with the mustfix and recommended suites into
#      SARIF next to the driver project. Any result fails the run.
#   3. The Driver Verification Log (dvl.exe, the kit's "dvl" target), which
#      bundles both into <driver>.DVL.XML, the artefact the HLK's Static Tools
#      Logo test reads.
#
# Static Driver Verifier is not part of this: the kit says it is no longer
# shipped or compatible with VS2022+, and CodeQL is what replaced it.
