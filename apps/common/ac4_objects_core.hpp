// One tap is a plain `obj` row. Several are `objm`: a contiguous range of ONE
// source's channels folded to a single mono object, each tap already scaled by
// 1/n so several full-range channels summed together do not clip past what one
// alone would (iclforge::ac3::plan::DestinationKind::kObjectMono's own contract). A slot
