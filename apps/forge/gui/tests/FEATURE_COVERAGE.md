# forge-gui feature coverage (Qt Quick Test)

What every user-facing feature of the Forge GUI (`apps/gui/qml`, driven by
`EncoderController`, `QcController`, `ObjectDecodeController`,
`StreamPlayerController`, `LanguageManager`) is exercised by. Two sets of tests
hold it: the Qt Quick suites in `apps/gui/tests/qml/tst_*.qml` (36 suites, 215
test functions), and the Qt-free C++ cases in `tests/gui/*.cpp` (four files, 45
cases, tagged `[gui]` and built into `iclforge-tests`). All the QML suites run the
real controllers, not mocks.

Columns: **Before** is the status before the tst_e2e_* suites were added
(commit `8ee7eb7f2`, 2026-09-24). **Now** is the current status. Status key:

- **UI**: a test drives the feature through the window. That means a mouse
  click, a key press, or a picker the real button opened and the test then
  accepted. The test asserts the outcome.
- **logic**: a test covers the feature, but it calls the controller or the
  window's function directly, or sets a QML property. No control is pressed.
- **none**: nothing covers it.

Picker seam: every `FileDialog` has an `objectName`. A test presses the real
button, checks that the picker it opened is showing, fills in
`selectedFile`/`selectedFolder` and calls `accept()`. This runs the same
`onAccepted` handler that a real pick runs.

Hardware: no platform output exists under the offscreen harness, and this
repo has no null sink. The Play and Audition cases assert whichever honest
outcome the machine gives: the dialog shows an error naming the output it
could not open, or playback really starts and the same button stops it. Live
capture, recording and receiver passthrough need a real capture device or an
S/PDIF/HDMI endpoint. They are covered only at the level the existing suites
reach without a device.

## Source loading

| Feature | Before | Now | Test case(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| First-run "Choose a file" card → WAV picker → source loaded | logic | UI | E2eEncode::test_firstRunChooseFileEncodeAc3AndDecodeWhatWasWritten (and every tst_e2e_* setup) |
| First-run "Open the bundled test signal" | UI | UI | TiersAndFlows::test_firstRunBundledTestSignalLoadsARealSource |
| First-run "Capture live" | UI | UI | TiersAndFlows::test_firstRunCaptureSwitchesToTheLiveBranch |
| Rail "+ Add files…" → add picker → second source | logic | UI | E2eEncode::test_playerExportsDecodedWavThatLoadsBackAsASource |

| Drag-and-drop / `forge-gui <file>` dispatch: a WAV becomes a source, a second WAV adds one, an `.ec3` opens the player, the window has a drop area for file URLs | logic | logic | DesktopIntegration::* (calls `openDroppedFile`, since an OS drag cannot be synthesised) |
| A dropped or launched `.ac4` | new | none | No case. `openDroppedFile` routes on the `.ac3`/`.ec3` suffix alone, so an `.ac4` goes to the WAV source loader. |
| Session restore of sources and assignments | logic | logic | TiersAndFlows::test_sessionSaveAndRestoreRoundTripsSourcesAndAssignments |

## Multi-source assignment

| Feature | Before | Now | Test case(s) |

## Encode runs and results

| Feature | Before | Now | Test case(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Encode button → save picker with planned name → AC-3 file; frames, KB, rate, duration on status and chip; file decodes to the right shape | logic | UI | E2eEncode::test_firstRunChooseFileEncodeAc3AndDecodeWhatWasWritten |
| Same for E-AC-3 (access units) | logic | UI | E2eEncode::test_expertCodecComboSwitchesToEac3AndEncodesAccessUnits |

## AC-4 (encode, QC, player, object page)

These controls arrived with AC-4 (planning/ac4.md, I3), after the tst_e2e_*
suites, so **Before** reads "new".

| Feature | Before | Now | Test case(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codec combo → AC-4; the AC-4 tab takes the place of Coding tools and Metadata | new | UI | E2eAc4::test_rawStreamFromThePageEqualsTheEchoedLine, test_mp4FileFromThePageEqualsTheEchoedLine |
| Container combo → MP4 for AC-4 (`out.mp4` on the echoed line) | new | UI | E2eAc4::test_mp4FileFromThePageEqualsTheEchoedLine |

| The AC-4 name filter of the QC, Inspect objects and Open stream file pickers | new | none | No case. The tests set the picker's `selectedFile` and accept it, so a name filter is not exercised. |
| AC-4 page settings → ac4-encode tokens and iclforge::ac4::EncoderConfig; presentation labels | new | logic | iclforge-tests [gui]: apps/forge/gui/tests/test_ac4_encode_settings.cpp (Qt-free) |

## AC-4 objects

The Objects tab's switch under the AC-4 codec (planning/ac4.md, I5b), which writes the
objects `forge atmos-encode … codec=ac4` writes, so **Before** reads "new".

| Feature | Before | Now | Test case(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Object mode keeps AC-4 as the codec; the AC-4 tab, the plan strip, the summary and the Encode button say AC-4 objects; the bit rate is left alone | new | UI | Ac4Objects::test_objectModeKeepsAc4AndOffersItsTabBesideTheObjectsTab |
| Codec combo in object mode: E-AC-3 and AC-4, never AC-3 (its entry is greyed out; the setter refuses it) | new | UI | Ac4Objects::test_codecPickerInObjectModeTakesEac3AndAc4ButNotAc3 |
| AC-4 tab in object mode: coding, dialnorm and CRC are controls; frame rate (shown native), rate mode, codec mode, I-frame interval, loudness and DRC are off; downmix and dialogue cards hidden | new | UI | Ac4Objects::test_ac4TabCarriesTheObjectControlsAndSwitchesOffWhatDescribesChannels |

| The count line counts a channel assigned to a speaker as an object held there ("assigned to speakers"), against 64; E-AC-3's "pinned to the bed" and its fifteen are as they were | new | UI | Ac4Objects::test_theCountLineCountsAChannelAssignedToASpeakerAsAnObjectNotAsABed |
| A container that is not raw or MP4 is refused beside the controls and before Encode | new | UI | Ac4Objects::test_aContainerAnObjectStreamCannotBeIsRefusedBesideTheControlsAndBeforeEncode |

| The object page reads the page's AC-4 objects: their count, movement and gain | new | UI | E2eAc4Objects::test_rawStreamOfOneSource…, test_mp4OfSeveralSources… |
| An ADM master's scene (two bed channels, one object that jumps) authored on the page decodes with its objects within 0.06 per axis and 2 dB | new | logic | E2eAc4Objects::test_anAdmMasterAuthoredOnThePageDecodesWithItsObjectsInTolerance (controller-level; the page reads audio, not ADM) |
| Object slots, pinned places, flat planes, object planes, the encode; AC-4 object settings → tokens and parameters | new | logic | iclforge-tests [gui]: apps/shared/media/tests/test_ac4_objects_core.cpp, test_ac4_encode_settings.cpp (Qt-free); [cli][atmos][ac4]: apps/forge/cli/tests/test_cli_atmos_encode_ac4.cpp |

## Counts

| | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Rows (features) | 115 | 160 |
| Driven from the UI | 16 | 85 |
| Logic only (controller or QML function called directly) | 80 | 62 |
| Not covered | 19 | 13 |

"UI (hardware)" and "UI/logic" rows count as UI. The 45 rows whose **Before**
reads "new" arrived after the tst_e2e_* suites, so **Before** counts only the
115 rows that existed then.

C++ line coverage of `apps/forge/gui/*.cpp|hpp` as it stood on 2026-09-24 (commit
`8ee7eb7f2`), from the QML suites plus the C++ unit tests that also compile
`gui_diagnostics.cpp`. It was measured with `/opt/gui-cov.sh`, a script kept
outside this repository. Before that change `forge_gui_qmltests` was not
instrumented at all; `iclforge::coverage` is now linked into it. The figures have
not been measured again. The six suites added since (the AC-4 ones and
`Teardown`) and the AC-4 code they reach are not in them.
