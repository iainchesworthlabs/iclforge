// from front) to the wider set of channels the general channel model can
// carry. Without this, a plan wider than a plain 5.1 bed had no way to place
// its extra channels at all: iclforge::ac3::analysis::channel_azimuth_deg(acmod, lfe,
// index) only ever knew about indices inside the BED's own acmod, so a
// dependent substream's channels always came back non-directional and simply
// never appeared on the ring, ceiling or otherwise. LFE/LFE2 stay
