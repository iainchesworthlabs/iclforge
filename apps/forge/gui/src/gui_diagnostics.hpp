// forge-gui's diagnostics file (docs/forge/gui/accessibility.md, "Saving a diagnostics
// file"): a bounded ring of one-line notes the controller writes to, and a
// renderer that turns named facts and that ring into plain text.
//
// The rule this module exists to hold, taken from the Crucible's own
// (apps/crucible/engine/src/diagnostics.hpp) because it was written for exactly
// this and has held since 2026-09: the file never carries the signing key,
// the path to a key file, the value of any environment variable, or one byte
// of anything the person loaded.
//
// It is held twice. First structurally - the report is composed from named
// fields, and there is no field for key bytes, for a key path, for the inline
// ICLFORGE_SIGNING_KEY value, or for one sample of audio; the settings
// section is a fixed list the caller whitelists, and any key under "signing/"
// is written as withheld whatever value arrived with it; the environment is
// never enumerated, only asked whether the two named signing variables exist
// at all. Second, as belt and braces for text that arrived through the
// message ring: the finished report is passed through scrub(), which replaces
// every spelling of the key path and of the inline key value with
// "<withheld>".
//
// What the report DOES carry, said plainly because it is not nothing: the
// sources section names each source the way the window's own rail names it,
// by base name and shape rather than by the path it was opened from, and the
// settings section carries the output folder the person chose, because that
// is a setting they set. The ring is the one section whose content this
// module does not compose: every EncoderController::setStatus() text lands
// in it, and those name files by base name today ("Could not read
// stems.wav: ...", "Wrote 212 frames ... to take.ec3") but nothing here
// enforces that on a caller added later. So the file is worth reading before
// it is attached to anything - which is why it is written where the person
// chooses and sent nowhere.
//
// This is a second copy of the Crucible's ring and scrub rather than a shared
// one, because that header's ReportFacts is welded to the Crucible engine's
// own types (EngineStatus, RenderEndpoint, SilentDeviceState) and forge-gui has
// none of them. Lifting the ring and scrub into apps/shared/media/src/ and leaving each
// window its own ReportFacts would remove the duplication; that is a change
// to a module the Crucible's tests already hold, and is worth doing on its
// own rather than inside an accessibility pass.
//
// No Qt here, deliberately, for the same reason the Crucible's is Qt-free:
// apps/forge/gui/tests/test_gui_diagnostics.cpp compiles this file straight into
// iclforge-forge-gui-tests, so the rule is checked on every CI leg including the ones that build no
// window at all. That is also why the file carries a gui_ prefix inside a
// directory already called gui: iclforge-forge-gui-tests compiles this module and the
// Crucible's into one target with both directories on its include path, and
// two headers named diagnostics.hpp would have a test resolve to whichever
// -I came first.
