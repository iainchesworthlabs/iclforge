// A streaming JSON writer, for `forge probe`'s machine-readable form.
//
// Deliberately not a document model. probe's whole posture is that a stream of
// any length costs the same to inspect (see ac3/io/probe.hpp), and a writer
// that built a tree of values before printing it would put that back: a
// per-frame dump of an hour of audio is millions of numbers, and none of them
// needs to be in memory at the same time as any other. So this writes each
// token as it is given one and keeps exactly one thing: the stack of
// still-open containers, which is what decides indentation and where the
// separating commas go.
//
// It is also not a general-purpose library. There is no reader, no value type
// and no schema validation, because the only consumer is one command emitting
// one documented shape - see docs/forge/cli/commands.md for that shape, which is the
// contract, rather than anything here. The member() shorthands, and the
// writers of the document's stream summary (apps/shared/media/src/probe_json.hpp), take
// it as the JsonSink it is, which Hearth's media information writes to as well.
