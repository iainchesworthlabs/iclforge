// The src=/map= multi-source subsystem: the primary positional file plus every src= path, opened
// and shaped, then routed as one programme (routing_for_sources) and gathered frame-by-frame
// (gather_frame) with each source's own offset= leading silence applied independently. Split out
// of main.cpp as step 2 of the repo-structure review's H4 monolith split - see support.hpp's own
// top comment for step 1 and the overall plan.
//
// Deliberately NOT unified with the classic single-file/in2.wav path (which stays in main.cpp,
// untouched): the two have genuinely different data shapes (one iclforge::ac3::io::WavData vs
// several), and duplicating the small amount that does overlap costs far less than a shared
// abstraction would risk - see this header's own struct/function comments, carried over verbatim
// from main.cpp.
