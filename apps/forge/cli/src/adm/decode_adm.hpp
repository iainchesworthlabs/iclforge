// The JOC -> ADM BWF writer - the write-direction sibling of atmos_adm.hpp's
// AdmAtmosSource/load_adm_atmos_source. Same reason for existing: decode.cpp cannot
// #include "iclforge/adm/adm.hpp" or "iclforge/adm/bridge.hpp" itself, not even behind a
// preprocessor guard (tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1 refuses ANY #if/#ifdef/#ifndef
// under src/ or apps/cli/commands - see atmos_adm.hpp's own top comment for the full reasoning),
// so this header is declared entirely in terms of iclforge::oba's own types (always available) and
// plain strings, and apps/cli/CMakeLists.txt selects exactly one of adm/enabled/decode_adm.cpp or
// adm/disabled/decode_adm.cpp to implement it - decode.cpp calls the function below
// unconditionally either way, gating only on forge_cli::adm_capability() (declared in
// atmos_adm.hpp, reused here rather than duplicated - "is ADM available in this build?" is the
// same question regardless of which direction a command needs it for).

// One OAMD update to a dynamic object's DynamicObject state, timestamped in absolute samples from
// the start of the whole decode - decode.cpp builds this by walking every decoded access unit's
// own object_metadata->blocks in file order and adding each block's own sample_offset to a
// running total of samples already emitted (object_audio's own length each access unit, since
// that is the count actually written, not numblkscod*256 - see decode.cpp's own accumulation for
// why). Mirrors iclforge::adm::WriteObjectUpdate field for field; kept as its own type rather
// than reused directly for the same reason AdmAtmosSource mirrors BridgeResult rather than
// including bridge.hpp - see this header's own top comment.
