// The continuous (streaming/live) audio commands: decode-and-play-back a whole file in real
// time ('monitor'), and capture-encode-monitor-and/or-passthrough continuously while also
// writing the encoded result to a file ('live'). Split out of main.cpp as part of the
// repo-structure review's H4 monolith split - the counterpart to commands/audio_io.hpp's
// one-shot record/play/devices/outputs, deliberately kept separate since run_live alone is
// ~800 lines and both commands share the "runs until done, not until one file is written"
// shape rather than audio_io's "single operation, then exit" one.

// bitstreamed) output - a sanity-check/preview path, and the offline half of
// live monitoring ('live's --monitor equivalent works the same way, one
// access unit at a time as it is produced instead of read from a file).
// Object metadata (JOC/OAMD), when present, is reported (object count) but
// not played or exported here: Eac3Decoder reads TS 103 420's object layer
// (DecodedSubstream::object_metadata/object_audio), but this path only plays
// the 5.1 bed - exactly what a legacy decoder hears, which is the thing most
// worth confirming actually sounds right. 'forge decode' with objects_dir
// is where the reconstructed object audio itself comes out.

// OAMD position, and the bed's LFE (never a JOC output - TS 103 420 §6.3.2.2
// bypasses it) goes out as a STATIC one. This is the one path that lets
// Dolby's own renderer engage with this project's reconstructed objects at
// all - see iclforge::audio::SpatialObjectSink's own header comment. Refuses
// cleanly, naming which Settings toggle would fix it, when the chosen

// LivePositionSource drained into an iclforge::objects::oba::SceneCursor at the same
// frame-end instant the orbit already samples at, so switching the source
// on changes WHERE objects go, never the shape of this loop.
