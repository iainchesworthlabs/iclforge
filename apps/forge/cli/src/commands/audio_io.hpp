// The one-shot (non-continuous) audio-hardware commands: enumerate capture/render endpoints and
// run a single record-to-file or play-one-file operation. 'monitor' and 'live' (the two
// continuous/streaming commands - decode-and-play-back, and capture-encode-monitor-and/or-
// passthrough) stay in main.cpp for a later step; run_live alone is ~800 lines and deserves its
// own focused PR rather than being folded in here. Split out as part of the repo-structure
// review's H4 monolith split - see support.hpp's own top comment for the overall plan.

// `routing_text` is iclforge::render::Routing's text form - a token per rendered
// channel, an output index or "-" - empty or "-" for the patch
// iclforge::audio::PcmOutput builds from the device's speakers. `level_db` is the
// tone's RMS level, in iclforge::render::IdentifyTone's accepted range.

// IEC 61937. The sink's render thread pulls bursts; this loop keeps it fed.
// bsid picks the branch: AC-3 wraps one frame per burst, E-AC-3 wraps one
// access unit at a time through a persistent Eac3BurstPacker, which may hold
// bytes back until enough have accumulated to fill a burst (see
// Eac3BurstPacker's own comment on why - Annex E frames can cover as few as
// one of the six blocks a burst period spans).
//
// play/monitor follow mode: when a specific device_index is named, this first asks what
// it actually accepts - iclforge::audio::read_sink_capabilities' EDID read where
// a backend has one, enumerate_render_devices' own live probe otherwise (see
// that header's comment for why the two are kept apart). A source format the
// sink rejects gets an automatic fallback rather than a refusal: E-AC-3 on an
// AC-3-only sink is transcoded to AC-3 first (stream tools's transcode, feeding
// this same passthrough path); a sink that bitstreams neither format falls
// back to decoded PCM (run_monitor). meta.follow_sink (follow=off) restores
// the plain refusal 'play' always gave before this roadmap item, the same
// on-by-default shape 'live's downmix_leg (downmix=off) already uses.
