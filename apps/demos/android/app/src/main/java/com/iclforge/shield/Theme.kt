/**
 * The demo's one shared palette/spacing scale - [MainActivity], [RoomView],
 * and [ChannelMeterView] all draw their own chrome by hand (plain [View]s
 * and raw [android.graphics.Canvas] calls, no XML styles/themes.xml to
 * centralize this the normal Android way), so without a single shared
 * source every screen drifted its own slightly-different grey/blue - this
 * is that source. Values, not semantics: this file owns "what color is
 * accent," not "what does accent mean" - each call site still decides how
 * to use them.
 *
 * A dark, near-black base (this app runs on a TV in a room dim enough to
 * see a receiver's own front-panel display) with one consistent accent hue
 * for anything "live"/informational, so the stats readout, panel titles,
 * and speaker meter all read as one family instead of three separately-
 * tuned overlays.
