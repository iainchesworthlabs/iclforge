/**
 * The v1 room visualization: a plain [View], not a `SurfaceView` - the plan's
 * own justification for a 2.5D `Canvas` approach at all ("a real-time
 * position dashboard with no lighting/occlusion/camera-navigation needs")
 * applies just as much to skipping `SurfaceView`'s own render thread and
 * `SurfaceHolder` lifecycle: a handful of `drawCircle`/`drawLine` calls per
 * frame is nowhere near enough work to justify that complexity, and
 * `postInvalidateOnAnimation`-driven `View.onDraw` already runs on the
 * Choreographer-synced UI thread vsync callback the plan asked for.
 *
 * Three panels, all reading the same [NativeBridge.nativeGetObjectState]
 * snapshot the encode loop (live_cursor.cpp's LiveCursorState) just built
 * for this frame:
 *  - top-right: top-down, room x (left/right) against room y (front/back)
 *  - bottom-right: side elevation, room x (left/right) against room z
 *    (floor/ceiling)
 *  - left (the bigger panel): a tilted isometric 3D view showing all three
 *    axes at once, plus the lead object's own trail through space - see
 *    [draw3DView]
 * matching oamd.hpp's Position contract (x,y in [0,1], z in [-1,1]) - see
 * live_cursor.cpp's LiveCursorState::deflect_selected clamp.
 *
 * Each panel is drawn as a rounded card (see [drawCard]) rather than a bare
 * stroked rectangle floating on the activity's own background - see
 * [Theme]'s own comment for why one shared palette exists at all.
 *
 * A few demoability additions on top of the raw positions: a listener marker
 * at the room's exact centre (where the JOC/VBAP render implicitly assumes
 * the listener sits - see live_cursor.cpp's trajectory_position comment), a
 * faint guide circle showing the lead object's planned orbit so a viewer can
 * see it being pushed off course and springing back rather than just seeing
 * a dot move, and live axis-mode/stream-stats readouts.
