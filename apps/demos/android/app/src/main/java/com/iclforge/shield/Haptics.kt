/**
 * Controller rumble tied to where the object actually is.
 *
 * Height is the hardest thing about this demo to be sure of by ear. Everything
 * else has a second channel of evidence — you can see the dot move left, and
 * you hear it move left. Elevation has only the sound, and a listener who is
 * not certain what they are supposed to be hearing tends to conclude they are
 * not hearing it. A pulse in the hand at the moment the object crosses over
 * the seat is a second channel for exactly the cue that lacks one.
 *
 * Deliberately event-driven rather than continuous: a permanently buzzing
 * controller stops meaning anything within about ten seconds, and it is the
 * fastest way to flatten a wireless pad's battery during a demo.
