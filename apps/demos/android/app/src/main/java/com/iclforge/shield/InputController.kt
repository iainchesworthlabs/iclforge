/**
 * Shield Controller (analog sticks + shoulder buttons + D-pad) and basic
 * Shield remote (D-pad only) input, both mapped to the same
 * [NativeBridge.nativeDeflectSelectedObject]/[NativeBridge.nativeSnapSelectedToCourse]
 * calls - see live_cursor.cpp's LiveCursorState for what actually consumes
 * these. Every input source here BIASES the selected object off its own
 * pre-planned trajectory rather than moving it outright; release the input
 * and native's own per-frame decay carries it back onto that trajectory on
 * its own (see LiveCursorState::advance) - nothing here has to detect "input
 * stopped" itself, it just stops calling in and the bias decays regardless.
 *
 * Two different input shapes, both continuous while held now, unified into
 * one accumulated bias vector applied once per animation frame
 * ([applyContinuousMovement], via a [Choreographer] callback) rather than
 * once per raw event - a per-event step would move in per-event jumps:
 *  - Analog (left stick x/y, right stick y for height): [stickX]/[stickY]/
 *    [stickZ], set continuously by [onGenericMotionEvent].
 *  - Digital (D-pad, shoulder buttons): [dpadX]/[dpadSecondary]/[shoulderZ],
 *    each pinned to -1/0/+1 for as long as the corresponding key is held,
 *    set in [onKeyDown] and cleared in [onKeyUp]. This is the ONLY control
 *    scheme the basic remote has at all, and it works identically whether or
 *    not a Shield Controller happens to also be connected.
 *
 * The D-pad's second axis (up/down) is [axisMode]-dependent: X/Y by default
 * (up biases the object toward the front wall/listener-facing direction,
 * down toward the back - room-anchored, not screen- or stick-relative, and
 * matching the analog stick's already-correct sense of "push away from you"
 * meaning forward), or X/Z (up/down biases height) after toggling - the
 * remote's only way to reach height at all, since it has no second stick or
 * shoulder buttons. Toggled by a SHORT press of the centre/select button -
 * deliberately immediate, not gated behind a long-press hold: on the basic
 * remote this is the ONLY way to reach height, and real-device testing found
 * a long-press-to-switch felt sluggish for something that needs switching
 * back and forth rapidly while actively shaping a path in real time. A LONG
 * press of the same button instead instantly snaps the selected object back
 * onto its planned course - a presenter's "and... reset" button, rather than
 * waiting out the usual ~1.5s spring-back decay - see
 * [onKeyLongPress]/[onKeyUp]'s disambiguation.
 *
 * No explicit InputDevice source detection/hot-plug listener: both schemes
 * are handled reactively as events arrive (onGenericMotionEvent only ever
 * fires for an analog-capable source in the first place), so there is
 * nothing that needs to know in advance which device is paired.
 *
 * The remote's dedicated play/pause keys mute/unmute the two ambient
 * objects (see [NativeBridge.nativeSetAmbientMuted]) - added after
 * real-device testing found three simultaneous tones made it hard to
 * precisely localize the lead object's own movement by ear. Pausing lets a
 * listener isolate it; playing brings the ambient wash back.
