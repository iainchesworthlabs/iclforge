/**
 * The speaker-activity meter: six segmented-LED-style bars showing the RMS
 * level of each real bed channel the encode loop's last frame actually
 * produced (live_cursor.cpp's StreamStats::channel_levels, sourced from
 * AtmosEncoder::bed() - not a guess derived from room-position math, the
 * literal audio a legacy 5.1 decoder hears). Exists to visually connect
 * "here's the object's position" (the other panels) with "here's the trick
 * that lets an ordinary decoder still hear it" - watching the bed channels
 * shift as the object pans is a much more concrete way to show that off
 * than just asserting it.
 *
 * Styled after a real hardware VU meter, not a plain progress bar: discrete
 * lit/unlit segments (each individually rounded - small, uniform corner
 * radii avoid the pinched-arc distortion a single tall rounded rect got into
 * at low levels, see [drawChannel]'s own comment), a bottom-to-top color
 * ramp that runs hotter toward the top, and a slowly-decaying peak-hold
 * line riding above the current level - the same "catch the loudest recent
 * moment" behavior a real meter's peak indicator has, not just an
 * instantaneous readout.
 *
 * A fixed-height row, not overlaid on RoomView: this app already hit real
 * layout bugs once from overlaying text on views that had no reserved space
 * for it (see MainActivity's own history) - a proper sibling view in the
 * same LinearLayout avoids repeating that. Shares [Theme]'s colors/type for
 * the title, but deliberately has no card background/border of its own
 * (unlike RoomView's panels) - it sits in the bottom bar next to the
 * control-hints text, not as a standalone dashboard panel, and hands-on
 * feedback was that a bounding rectangle here just read as visual noise; a
 * title plus a divider line is enough to mark it as its own section.
