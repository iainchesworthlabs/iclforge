/**
 * What the currently-connected HDMI sink actually advertises.
 *
 * The app has always had exactly one question it could ask about the route -
 * `AudioTrack.isDirectPlaybackSupported(...)`, a yes/no for one format - and
 * that call is unusable for anything richer here: it blocks indefinitely
 * against a direct `AudioTrack` that is open or opening on the same route,
 * which is a confirmed-on-hardware Activity hang, not a hypothetical (see
 * `MainActivity.reconcileReceiverState` and `docs/platforms/android.md`).
 *
 * `AudioManager.getDevices` is a different API against a different object: it
 * reports what the *route* enumerates rather than asking the policy manager to
 * validate a track configuration. That is what makes it usable while
 * streaming, and it is what lets the waiting screen say "your receiver
 * advertises DD+ but not JOC" instead of the single bit "not ready".
 *
 * **Still called off the main thread anyway.** Whether `getDevices` contends
 * the same audio-policy lock that `isDirectPlaybackSupported` deadlocks
 * against is unproven - nothing in this project has established it either way
 * - so this is treated as guilty until a real device says otherwise. See
 * [probeAsync].
