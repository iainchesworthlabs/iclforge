// on ordinary CI (secrets aren't exposed there, and assembleDebug never
// reads a release signingConfig anyway) - releaseSigningAvailable gates
// both whether the config is created at all and which one `release` uses,
// so every build path degrades to the debug keystore exactly as before
// this was wired up, rather than failing when the four env vars are unset.

// netty artifacts are forced to the same version because Netty only
// supports matched versions across its modules.
//
// force() does reach the UTP-internal configurations - but AGP only
// creates and resolves them inside connectedDebugAndroidTest's own task
// action, gated behind a device-availability check that runs before any
// dependency resolution happens. No other task or flag resolves them
// (confirmed: they don't exist in the configuration container until that
// task is requested, and `--info` shows zero resolution activity for them
// when the task fails at the device check). That means:
//   - `./gradlew --write-locks` against assembleDebug/assembleDebugAndroidTest/
//     assembleRelease (CI's and most local runs' usual tasks) NEVER touches
//     these configurations, so bumping a version above does NOT by itself
//     re-secure the lockfile for the UTP-internal path.
//   - After changing any version here, re-run
//     `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest --write-locks` against a
//     real device or a working emulator and commit the gradle.lockfile
//     diff - otherwise the UTP-internal entries silently keep whatever was
//     last actually resolved that way (check gradle.lockfile's git blame).
//   - Until that's done, running connectedDebugAndroidTest for real
//     without --write-locks should fail on a dependency-lock mismatch for
//     the bumped module rather than silently using the old version - a
//     loud failure there is this gap surfacing, not an unrelated bug.
