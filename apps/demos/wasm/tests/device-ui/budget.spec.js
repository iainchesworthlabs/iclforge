// The flash budget planning/esp32-device-ui.md sets for the page (decision 18):
// the page and its script together, as the firmware embeds them. LF
// line endings too (.gitattributes pins them), so a Windows checkout embeds,
// budgets and maps coverage onto the same bytes CI does.
//
// 24,576 since Hearth B2, re-derived rather than raised to fit: the page lost
// the playback controls, which a server now owns, and gained the settings that
// are the board's own - a name, a network, a slot width, the wiring.
//
// 28,672 since Hearth B3: the Sendspin player's section - the server, the
// link, the clock, how late the stream plays, underruns, a level per output,
// a pairing code and the three pairing actions. planning/esp32-device-ui.md,
// decision 18, has the image sizes behind it: the budget is a statement about
// keeping the page small enough to read and serve from flash rather than
// about running out of room.
//
// 45,056 since the redesign: Hearth's own look - its palette in both schemes,
// section rules, segmented controls for the slot width and the named
// layouts, level meters, a toast for the live region and a dialog before
// forgetting every server - and the board's network and firmware. Decision
// 22 has the images it was measured against.
//
// 49,152 since the list of paired servers: GET /pairing's servers, each by
// its name with a Forget, and the one dialog asking before forgetting one
// server or every server. Decision 22's re-derivation has the images.
//
// 57,344 since the firmware section (decision 29): both slots, a trial, an
// upload and the last update; an upload from a file with the bytes sent
// shown; Restart and Roll back behind the dialog, which now asks before
// anything that cannot be taken back. Decision 22's second re-derivation has
// the images.
