// The one PairingStore a Hearth process has. NetworkController's ServerHost pairs
// through it, and HearthController's Settings page lists and forgets its records
// - two stores over the same settings would each keep their own copy of the
// records (PairingStore reads the settings once, when it is made), so a pairing
// made on the Network page would be missing from the Settings page until a
// restart, and a record forgotten there would still be used by the network side
// and written back by its next save.
//
// The store has a QSettings of its own, which nothing else uses: PairingStore's
// own comment says the settings store under it must be one nothing else touches,
// since the network's thread writes it too. Changes made through one QSettings
// object are visible at once through any other in the same process over the
// same settings, so the controllers' own QSettings still read what it writes.
//
// Only the GUI thread calls this (each controller's constructor). The store
// lives while a controller holds it, so it is made and destroyed while Qt is
// up rather than by static destruction after it has gone.
