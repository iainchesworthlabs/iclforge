// The one object QML talks to for the queue and the transport
// (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A5: "a controller polling the
// engine's snapshot"). Everything it shows comes from Engine::status(),
// read on a timer at CrucibleController's own rate (kPollMs) rather than
// from Engine::on_change(), which runs on the engine's own thread and would
// have to hop back to the GUI thread to touch a single Qt property - polling
// does that hop once for the whole snapshot instead.
//
// This first slice owns the engine directly, with a device PCM sink
// (apps/hearth/engine/pcm_sink.hpp) and a loader that reads raw
// `.ac3`/`.ec3` files (item_loader.hpp). The engine is given every render
// endpoint to decide between (EngineOutputs::endpoints,
// apps/hearth/engine/output_selector.hpp) rather than one fixed sink, so the
// output picker's "Play here" can name an endpoint - no passthrough sink is
// given yet, so every item still decodes to PCM, on the platform's default
// device until a picker row is chosen. The layout is no longer fixed either:
// start() opens at whatever settings_model.hpp's SavedSpeakerSetup last
// kept ("2.0" the first time, or when that no longer parses), and the
// Speakers page's setLayoutText()/setHeights()/setSpeakerSmall() can change
// it from there for the engine's whole life (Player::set_layout()) -
// save_on_quit() keeps whatever it last settled on, with trim/delay/
// crossover/routing, for the next start() to reopen at (issue #885). One
// setup today, not one per output device - SavedSpeakerSetup's own comment
// says why.
