// What NetworkController knows about each group, shared with HearthController
// without either holding a reference to the other's QObject
// (network_controller.hpp's own comment explains why they do not: two
// independent QML singletons, on the same poll rhythm for the same reason,
// with no natural owner to hand a reference between them). Both are
// QML_SINGLETON, instantiated by the QML engine itself with no constructor
// arguments to inject one through, so this is the third, shared piece of
// state the coupling needs instead - a Meyers singleton, not a QObject,
// deliberately outside either controller's own ownership.
//
// NetworkController's poll() replaces the whole table each tick
// (set_groups()), so a group that disappears (deleted, or the sink lost)
// drops out within one tick rather than being read stale. HearthController's
// own poll() reads it to keep OutputPreferences::group_ready current for
// whichever group is pinned as the output (hearth_controller.cpp's own
// selectOutputGroup()/poll()), and the resolver Player's own NetworkGroupSink
// is built with (hearth_controller.cpp's EngineOutputs) reads group() at each
// open() - always whatever NetworkController last published, never a value
// captured once.
//
// Locked: the two controllers run on the GUI thread, but that resolver runs on
// the engine's own thread, whenever the player opens its output - while the
// GUI thread may be replacing the table under it.
