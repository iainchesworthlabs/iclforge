// The application's ItemLoader (apps/hearth/engine/src/session.hpp: "the path is
// turned into bytes by an ItemLoader, which the application supplies").

// This first slice reads a raw `.ac3`/`.ec3`/`.ac4` elementary stream from
// disk and nothing else: apps/shared/media/src/container_input.hpp's Matroska/MP4/
// MPEG-TS readers join this loader in a later slice, the same way the plan's
// Media section describes. A path this loader does not recognise is not a
// crash - it comes back as an error, which Session::open() turns into the
// item's unplayable reason, so the queue lists the file and says why rather
// than leaving it out. `.ac4` bytes play since planning/ac4.md's phase I2:
// Session::open() splits their sync frames, and iclforge::ac4::Decoder decodes them.

// what make_file_item_loader() above can actually open: a `.mp4`/`.mkv`/
// `.ts` container is listed too, on the same footing as `.ac3`/`.ec3`/`.ac4`,
// because a real folder of media mixes them and leaving them out would
// silently drop files "Add folder..." looks like it ought to find. Nothing
// here judges playability - a container path comes back and, handed to
// make_file_item_loader() like any other queue item, gets the same
// unplayable reason a container passed to addFiles() directly already gets.
// A folder that does not exist, or cannot be read, comes back empty rather
// than throwing.
