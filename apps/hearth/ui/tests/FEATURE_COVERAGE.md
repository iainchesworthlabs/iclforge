# Hearth window: feature coverage from the UI

Every user-facing feature of `apps/hearth/ui/assets/qml` and the
`HearthController`/`NetworkController` surface it drives, mapped to the Qt
Quick Test cases (`apps/hearth/ui/tests/qml/tst_*.qml`) that exercise it.
Case names are `Suite::test_function` (the suite is the TestCase `name`).

Status:

- **UI**: driven from the UI (click, key, typed text, drop, dialog) against the real controller, with the outcome asserted.
- **logic**: exercised only by calling the controller, or by rendering a page without driving it.
- The four defects this work found are fixed; each now has a normal regression case. See "UI bugs found (fixed)".
- **none**: not exercised.

## How the suites stand in for hardware

- **Audio device**: `TestServices.useFakeRoom()` (`tests/test_room.cpp`) hands `HearthController` a fake room of three endpoints ("Test speakers" 6 ch default, "Test headphones" 2 ch, "Test receiver" 8 ch with AC-3/E-AC-3 passthrough) through `HearthController::set_test_outputs()` - a seam of the same shape as `CrucibleController::set_test_services()`. The REAL engine decodes real golden streams (`tests/golden/external-baseline/...`, `esp-idf/.../objects-mdct.ec3`) into it, and the AC-4 page's suite plays tones that `TestServices.writeAc4Stream()` encodes with `iclforge::ac4::Encoder`; the fake device has its own clock and records frames heard, peak level, the endpoint opened and how many times. So "it plays" is asserted on what the device received.
- **Network sink**: `TestServices.startTestSink()` runs `apps/hearth/testsink`'s real `Sink` in-process on loopback and hands it to `NetworkController`'s own `NetworkSinks` as a found service (`NetworkController::sinks_for_test()` + `NetworkSinks::on_found()`), which is the one step mDNS multicast would otherwise do. After that it is real: WebSocket dial, pairing with the code the sink prints, groups, player commands.
- **File dialogs**: under `-platform offscreen`, QtQuick.Dialogs shows its non-native dialog. The suites click the page's own button, which opens it, and then `accept()` it. The file is set as the dialog's selection before it opens, because the non-native dialog drops a selection made after it has opened.
- **Drag and drop**: `TestServices.dropFiles()` sends real DragEnter/DragMove/Drop events that carry file URLs to the window, so the page's own DropArea receives them.
- **Keys into Main.qml's window**: `TestServices.keyClick()` (`QTest::keyClick` on that `QWindow`). `TestCase.keyClick()` only ever reaches the test case's own window.

### Totals

| | Before (4 suites, 18 cases) | After (15 suites, 88 cases) |
|---|---|---|
| UI | 5 | 102 |
| logic only | 15 | 2 (row 15: no UI control exists; row 93: nothing to select) |
| none | 87 | 3 (rows 105 to 107) |

### Cases without a feature row of their own

These cases call a controller surface directly, or guard a regression, and belong to no single row
above.

| Case | What it checks |
|---|---|
| DecoderAc4::test_twoChangesInOneTurnBothLand | Two AC-4 page controls changed in one turn of the event loop both land. Each page write used to copy the settings it last read, so the second put the first back |
| DecoderSettings::test_emptyMapChangesNothing | `setDecoderSettings({})` leaves every setting as it was, and does not reset them to their defaults |
| DecoderSettings::test_twoWritesInOneTurnBothLand | Two keys written in one turn, each alone, both show at once and still show once the engine's status has caught up |
| DecoderSettings::test_slidersCheckboxesAndTextFieldsRoundTripThroughTheController | Cut, boost, heavy compression, dialogue normalisation, RF ceiling, phase shift, LFE and fast inverse transform each read back what was written |
| NetworkPairing::test_codeTypedWrongSaysSoAndTheRightOnePairs | A wrong code is reported and empties the boxes, and the right one then pairs the sink |
| NetworkSinkSettings::test_nothingSelectedLeavesEveryPropertyAtItsEmptyDefault | Every sink property is empty while no sink is selected |
| NetworkSinkSettings::test_everySetterIsASafeNoOpWithNoSinkSelected | Every sink setter and identify call does nothing, without an error, while no sink is selected |
| NetworkSinkSettings::test_everyPageRendersSafelyWithNoSinkSelected | The sink's Speakers, Decoder, Report and Only-on-sink pages render against empty data |
| PlayQueue::test_urlToLocalFileConvertsAUrlWithoutThrowing | `urlToLocalFile` converts a `url` value as a file dialog hands it over. Its failure was the crash the Add files and Add folder dialogs and the drop area hit |
| PlayQueue::test_addFilesAppendsRowsWithTitleFromTheFileName | `addFiles` appends rows titled by file name |
| PlayQueue::test_addFilesReflectedInThePageQueueList | The page's queue list follows additions and removals |
| PlayQueue::test_playItemChangesCurrentIndex | `playItem` moves the current index and marks that row current |
| SpeakersRouting::test_setRoutingAssignmentRoundTripsThroughTheController | `setRoutingAssignment` patches one slot and unassigns it again |
| SpeakersRouting::test_clearRoutingAndUseDeviceOrderRoundTripThroughTheController | `clearRouting` unassigns every slot and `useDeviceOrder` patches them in the device's order |

Gaps that remain inside covered rows:

- The sink's own trim, delay, routing and identify edits are not driven: even the accept-settings test sink manages none of them (`management.routing` false, trim range 0..0, `identify` false), so only the layout edit is shown reaching a sink.
- The group volume slider and each member's mute checkbox are not driven. Only a member's volume slider is (row 77).
- A stream whose object metadata is not read makes row 20's case skip, and no case plays an AC-4 item with objects through the window.
- The Only-on-sink panel is rendered but its text is not read.
- The Firmware tab's Update, Roll back and Restart are not driven: the test sink serves no firmware routes. The client behind them (`apps/hearth/engine/src/sink_firmware.hpp`) is tested in `iclforge-hearth-tests` against a stand-in board on loopback (`[sink-firmware]`), and against a real board by the hidden live case in `apps/hearth/engine/tests/test_sink_firmware_board.cpp`.

## UI bugs found (fixed)

Each was first shown failing on the unfixed code, then fixed.

1. **hearth segfaulted on start (Qt 6.9.3, qmlcachegen-compiled QML).**
   - Cause: `Network.qml`'s `Loader.sourceComponent` read members off a local (`const group = NetworkController.selectedGroup; if (group && group.id ...)`). qmlcachegen compiled that as a value-type lookup on QVariant, passing `QMetaType::fromName("QVariant").metaObject()` (null) to `AOTCompiledContext::initGetValueLookup()`, which dereferenced it.
   - Fix: the binding reads `NetworkController.selectedGroup.id`, `.selectedSink.id` and `.selectedSink.badge` straight off the singleton. The generated `Network_qml.cpp` now has no QVariant value lookups. The behaviour is unchanged, because an empty map's `.id` is undefined. A comment at the binding says why it must not be "simplified" back.
   - Check: `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen build/gui-cov/bin/hearth` under `timeout 5` now exits 124 (still running); before the fix it exited 139.
   - The `QML_DISABLE_DISK_CACHE=1` workaround is gone from `tests/CMakeLists.txt`, so every suite runs the compiled QML.
   - Regression: `NetworkPageAot::test_networkPageBuildsWithNothingSelected` and `test_networkPageBuildsWithAGroupSelected` (unskipped; both segfaulted before the fix, as did `shell`).
2. **Speakers "Clear" did nothing while a device was open.**
   - Cause: `HearthController::clearRouting()` posted a patch sized for zero outputs, which `PcmOutput::set_routing()` refuses.
   - Fix: it now posts every slot unassigned for the open device's own output count (`Routing::from_outputs(all -1, routingOutputs)`).
   - Regression: `SpeakersPage::test_clearRoutingButtonUnpatchesEverySlot`.
3. **The sink Speakers tab offered edits that were silently dropped.**
   - Cause: the sink's state did not list the Settings command, but the controls were enabled anyway.
   - Fix, in NetworkController:
     - `sinkSpeakerSettings.settingsAccepted` says whether the sink's `iclforge_state` lists the Settings command.
     - The report says "The sink does not take settings from Hearth." instead of "Nothing sent yet.".
     - A push that is refused anyway is recorded (`note_push()`) and reported as "not sent: ...".
   - Fix, in QML: `NetworkSinkSpeakers.qml` disables every control and shows the reason (`networkSinkSettingsBlocked`). `NetworkSinkDecoder.qml`'s `accepts()` also requires the command.
   - The test sink gained `SinkOptions::accept_settings` (off by default), so a sink that does take settings can be shown receiving an edit.
   - Regressions: `NetworkPairing::test_pairedSinkSpeakersTabIsDisabledWhenTheSinkTakesNoSettings` and `NetworkPairing::test_sinkThatTakesSettingsAppliesAnEditFromTheSpeakersTab`.
4. **A refused trim or delay value stayed displayed after focus left.**
   - Fix: both fields now carry the same `Binding on text { when: !activeFocus }` restore as the page's layout and crossover fields. The page reverts rather than clamps, so this is consistent with it.
   - Regression: `SpeakersPage::test_sizeTrimAndDelayPerSpeaker`.

Not bugs, but worth knowing:

- An item's facts (codec, channels, duration) are read when the engine opens it, not when it is added. A freshly queued row shows only its file name until it has played or been prepared as the next item.
- In the non-native dialog, `FileDialog.accept()` keeps only a selection that was made before `open()`.

## C++ coverage (secondary measure)

These are line figures from `build/gui-cov`, with the Hearth `.gcda` files cleared before each run.
They were measured with fourteen suites, before the AC-4 engine, the diagnostics endpoint and the
present fifteenth suite, and have not been measured again:

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/hearth/engine` | 835 / 5184 lines, 16.1% (4 original suites) | 3105 / 5184 lines, 59.9% (14 suites) |

- `apps/hearth/ui/*.cpp` (the controllers) is not instrumented in this tree, because `iclforge::coverage` is not applied to the Qt app or test targets. So the controllers have no gcov figure.
- `/opt/gui-cov.sh` searches the whole repository for `.gcda` files, including other build trees. Its figure for `apps/hearth` (80%+) mostly comes from `iclforge-hearth-tests` runs elsewhere. To count only these suites, add `build/gui-cov/apps/hearth` as gcovr's search path.

## Running

```
cmake --build <build dir> --target hearth_qmltests
ctest --test-dir <build dir> -L hearth-ui --output-on-failure
```

`ctest` runs each `tst_*.qml` file as its own process (`hearth_qml_tests_<suite>`, with a 300 s
limit), under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` and `QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software`. `-R
hearth_qml_tests_` selects the same set by name, and `-j2` runs two suites at a time.
