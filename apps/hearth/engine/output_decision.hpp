// Which output Hearth plays through, on which endpoint, and why
// (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A3).
//
// Pure: it takes what a probe found and what the user asked for, and names a
// mode, an endpoint and a one-line reason. Nothing here opens a device, which
// is what lets the whole table of cases run on a machine with no sound card -
// including the cases one desk with one receiver can never produce.
//
// Shaped after Crucible's own decision (apps/crucible/engine/output_policy.hpp)
// so the two applications' Output screens can be read against each other.
// What differs is what is being chosen between: Hearth plays a stream that
// already exists rather than encoding a live one, so its modes are "bitstream
// this file as it is", "transcode it to AC-3 and bitstream that", "decode it
// and play PCM here", "hand it to a group of network sinks", and "nothing
// usable".
//
// The other difference is that Hearth has to answer the sink-following gaps
// the appliance plan left open (planning/player-appliance.md, "What UX9
// needs"), and three of the six are settled by the shape of this function
// rather than by its contents:
//
//   * Gap 1, the default endpoint never probed. There is no "the default is
//     taken at its word" path here: an endpoint's capabilities arrive as
//     facts, and the default endpoint is one row like any other. A caller
//     that cannot probe an endpoint says so with CapabilitySource, and gets a
//     decision that accounts for not knowing.
//   * Gaps 3 and 5, a sink that changed and an EDID read once. A pure
//     function has nothing to remember, so re-deciding on a device change is
//     the whole mechanism: iclforge::audio::RenderDeviceWatch reports the change,
//     the caller re-reads the facts and calls this again.
//   * Gap 6, "no descriptor" and "no reader" collapsed into one note. They
//     are separate CapabilitySource values, and the reason text says which,
//     because "your receiver is off" and "this machine cannot read EDID" are
//     different problems for whoever is holding the phone.
