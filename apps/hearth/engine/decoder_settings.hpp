// The decoder configuration model (planning/hearth-reference-player.md,
// "Decoder configuration"): what the app's decoder controls hold, and the
// library configuration they become. One place, so the settings page, the
// engine and the tests agree on what each control means.
//
// The controls are the plan's table, row for row. The operating mode chooses
// one of §7.7's two canonical modes or the custom switches under it; the
// stereo fold is what a two-speaker layout gets (a one-speaker layout folds to
// mono, a wider one is rendered); the mix levels replace the stream's in any
// fold. Dual mono is the one control no library setting holds - the output
// stage leaves the choice of programme to its caller - so StreamDecoder
// applies it after decoding.
//
// AC-4 (planning/ac4.md, I2, and its "One control for both formats") shares
// the stereo fold, the LFE in a fold, the concealment and the layout with
// AC-3 and E-AC-3, and has controls of its own in Ac4Settings: the
// presentation, its DRC decoder mode and output level, which decision 12
// keeps apart from E-AC-3's operating mode, dialogue enhancement, and the
// dialogue and associated audio levels.
