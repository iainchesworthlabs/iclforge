// Access units in, rendered blocks out (planning/hearth-reference-player.md,
// A3: "a session per item: ... decoder, renderer ...").
//
// One AC-3 syncframe or one E-AC-3 access unit at a time, decoded and placed
// onto the output layout a 256-frame block at a time, with nothing copied
// that the decoders' block form does not already hand over. The shape is the
// one apps/hearth/testsink/src/burst_output.cpp settled on for the same job, and
// for the same reasons:
//
//   * A unit that is exactly one AC-3 syncframe goes to the AC-3 decoder, and
//     anything else - an AC-3 core carrying E-AC-3 dependents included - to
//     the E-AC-3 decoder, which a fold also applies to. Deciding from the
//     first frame's bsid alone sends a legacy-core stream down the wrong path.
//   * The block form hands samples over before it returns the unit's layout,
//     so each unit's bed is read from its headers first and queued; a unit's
//     first block takes the oldest bed not yet placed. That keeps a unit held
//     back for transient pre-noise processing (§3.7) matched to its own bed
//     when it is finally released, one call later.
//   * One programme: the first unit's. Which programme that is, is the
//     session's choice of units (Session::open), not this decoder's.
//
// Everything else a listener can choose comes from DecoderSettings: the
// library configuration decoder_setup() makes of it, and dual mono's choice
// of programme, applied here to each unit that codes 1+1 before it is placed.
//
// After a unit's blocks, what the unit said about itself goes to an optional
// second callback as a UnitReport: its service, dialnorm, compr and dynrng
// words, the fold levels in force, whether it was concealed, and its objects.
// The report belongs to the blocks the call delivered, so a unit held back
// for transient pre-noise processing is reported by the call that releases
// it, and the last one by finish().
//
// What the test sink never needed and a player does is the end of a stream.
// A unit still held back when the stream ends is released by
// Eac3Decoder::flush() as raw substreams rather than an assembled unit, so
// finish() assembles them and runs them through a §7.8 output stage of its
// own before rendering - without that, the last frame of every stream that
// used the tool is silently lost (which `forge monitor` does today). The
// stage is a fresh one, so the two parts of the output stage that carry state
// between frames - the Lt/Rt phase shift's filter tail and RF mode's
// protection gain - restart for that one frame; everything else, dialnorm
// included, is exactly what the decoder would have applied.
//
// AC-4 (planning/ac4.md, I2; objects and the immersive layout control, I5): a
// unit that starts with an AC-4 sync word is one sync frame, which goes to
// iclforge::ac4::Decoder through its public API alone (iclforge/ac4/decoder/decoder.hpp): decode()
// reads the whole frame at once - channels, and, where a presentation carries
// them, objects with their Annex F properties - and place_ac4_frame() places
// it on the layout a kBlockSamples chunk at a time, by the channels' (or, with
// objects, Ac4ObjectRenderer's rendered) speakers (ac4_bed()). A one- or
// two-speaker layout takes the decoder's own downmix in place of §7.8's fold,
// as decoder_setup() configures it; a wider one takes the immersive layout
// DecoderSettings::Ac4Settings::immersive_layout asks for, or the source's own
// where it asks for none. Settings change in place (apply()): set_output()
// and set_presentation() take them from the next frame, and the decoder keeps
// what it has read. A frame waiting for an I-frame puts out nothing and is
// delivered as silence of the unit's length, the samples the caller says it
// codes; a frame that fails, under no concealment policy, first releases what
// the decoder holds (always nothing now - decode()'s own frame is delivered
// whole before decode_ac4() returns - kept as a call for the reason
// flush_ac4()'s own comment gives), so the caller's count of what came out
// stays true. The unit report says what the frame was: its presentation, its
// speakers as an acmod, its dialnorm and DRC mode and the decoder's latency.
