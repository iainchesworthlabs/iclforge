// The streaming transcode to AC-3 (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A3;
// the appliance plan's gap 4): an E-AC-3 item for a receiver that takes AC-3
// but not E-AC-3.
//
// The player decodes the item for it onto a fixed 5.1 layout with neutral
// settings (transcode_settings()), whose slots are already in the order an
// AC-3 encoder takes them - L C R Ls Rs, then the LFE. This gathers those
// blocks into six-block frames and encodes each as 3/2 with LFE at 448 kbit/s,
// the rate `forge transcode` uses.
//
// What the source says about itself goes with it, frame by frame, from the
// reports of the units the frame was encoded from:
//   * dialnorm, without which a levelled system plays the programme up to
//     30 dB too loud, and the service (bsmod), where it means the same for 3/2
//     - a voice-over's code is karaoke's there. Both are the unit's whose
//     samples sit mid-way through what the frame decodes to, so at a join a
//     frame takes the item that fills most of it; a service stays said for the
//     rest of its item and no further.
//   * the compr word. Every frame has one, so a receiver in RF mode is kept
//     from overload whatever the source sent. Where the units the frame
//     reaches all sent one, the frame has the most attenuating of them: a
//     decoder crossfades one frame's gain into the next, so the frame's word
//     governs some of the unit before too. Where any sent none, the frame's
//     own word, from a heavy compressor that meters the frame the way the
//     encoder does against the frame's own dialnorm, counts as well. (The
//     command line writes no compr for a source with none.)
//   * for dual mono heard as its second channel, that channel's dialnorm and
//     compr.
// The fold levels an encoder writes are fixed for it, so they are an
// argument (fold_levels() reads an item's), and an item that folds at other
// levels does not join. dynrng is not carried, as the command line's
// transcode does not carry it: nothing can write it into a frame after the
// encoder.
//
// The encoder's output runs 256 samples behind its input (kDelay): the first
// frame a receiver decodes starts with the transform's own 256 samples, and
// the last 256 samples taken come out only in the frame after. finish() pads
// the last frame by holding each channel's last sample - a drop to silence
// would be a transient the encoder spends a block switch on - and encodes
// until every sample taken has come out.
