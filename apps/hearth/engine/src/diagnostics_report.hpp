// The diagnostics file (the Settings page's "Save diagnostics"): named facts,
// an engine snapshot and the ring (diagnostic_log.hpp), as plain text - what
// Hearth has done: the outputs it opened, the items it played, and every
// error.
//
// The page says pairing keys, codes and file paths are left out. The rule is
// held as Crucible's is (apps/crucible/engine/diagnostics.hpp): first by what
// the report reads, then by a scrub of what it wrote.
// - The facts are named fields, and none of them is a path, a key or a code.
// - Of the engine's snapshot, the report never reads an item's path except
//   to withhold it, nor the free-text note and error: they can quote a path
//   an item loader was given, for an item that may have left the queue
//   since. Every error is in the ring instead, withheld as it was written.
// - A setting under one of kWithheldSettings is written as withheld whatever
//   value arrived with it.
// - The finished text is scrubbed of the folders of every item in the queue,
//   and of the caller's secrets: the settings folder, the person's home
//   folder, a pairing code on screen.
//
// Pairing and the network (A4's sinks, found and paired) join the file when
// the engine drives them; their records belong under "pairing/".
