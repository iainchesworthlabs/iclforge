// A Hearth sink's firmware, from this computer (planning/esp32-ota.md, O5).
//
// The board's own HTTP routes on port 80 - GET /hardware and GET /firmware,
// PUT /firmware, PUT /firmware/rollback and POST /restart - which
// tools/hearth/ota.py and the board's own page use as well. Nothing here goes
// through Sendspin: an update stops the board's Sendspin player and restarts
// the board, and the Network page has to go on following it through that.
//
// GET /firmware's answer is read into iclforge::FirmwareStatus, the struct the
// board renders it from (esp-idf/iclforge/include/iclforge/
// firmware_status.hpp), and an image is held to the board's own rules
// (firmware_image.hpp) before a byte of it is sent. The rest is ota.py's push
// in C++: the checks it makes before an upload, the upload with its
// Content-Digest, and how it reads the board's answers through the restart and
// the trial. Its words too, where the page shows them, so that the tool, the
// board's page and this app describe one update the same way.
