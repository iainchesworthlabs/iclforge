// One queue item, opened (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A3: "a session
// per item: container input, access units, decoder ...").
//
// The session owns the item's bytes and what a scan found in them - its
// access units, how many samples each codes, its rate and width - and walks
// them through a StreamDecoder on request. It owns no decoder and no output:
// the player keeps one StreamDecoder for the output layout and hands it to
// whichever session is current, which is what lets one item end and the next
// begin without anything being reopened.
//
// Splitting and timing are io::scan()'s, not a second reading of the same
// headers: a scan already reports an AC-3 stream, an E-AC-3 stream and an AC-3
// core carrying E-AC-3 dependents as the right units, and records each unit's
// own length - 1536 samples for AC-3, and 256, 512, 768 or 1536 for an E-AC-3
// unit, which a player that assumes 1536 gets wrong in both its duration and
// its seeks.
//
// An item plays only the part of its stream its loader says to: an MP4 edit
// list's priming at the start and padding at the end are decoded - the
// decoder needs them - but never delivered, so two such items join with
// nothing of either encoder's making between them (the plan's Gapless
// playback section). Positions and durations count from the start of that
// part.
//
// A decoder that starts part-way through a stream - after a seek, or when the
// settings change and a new one takes over - has none of the overlap the unit
// before would have left it, and its first block would differ from an
// unbroken decode's. So it starts one unit early, and that unit is decoded
// and dropped: from the first frame delivered on, the audio is what an
// unbroken decode gives.
//
// No file I/O: the path is turned into bytes by an ItemLoader, which the
// application supplies (reading the file and demuxing Matroska, MP4 or
// MPEG-TS through apps/shared/media/src/container_input.hpp, whose functions the engine
// does not compile) and a test supplies over memory.
//
// AC-4 (planning/ac4.md, I2): the units are the stream's sync frames, and
// each one's length the samples iclforge::ac4::Decoder puts out for it, which
// ac4_stream.hpp works out before anything is decoded. What differs is where
// a decoder can start. An AC-4 decoder needs the configuration an I-frame
// sends, and its output runs behind its input by latency_samples() - 1,313
// samples at frame_rate_index 13, more where the sample rate converter runs -
// through filters whose memory the frames before carry. So a decoder starting
// part-way through starts at the last I-frame at least kAc4PreRollSamples
// before the unit wanted, and everything before that unit is decoded and
// dropped; what comes out from there is an unbroken decode's, but for the
// dynamic range control's gain smoothing, whose state takes longer than any
// pre-roll to settle where the stream compresses hard. A stream played from
// its start gets no pre-roll: its first frames play as the decoder puts them
// out, its latency included, as `forge decode` writes them. A frame waiting
// for an I-frame puts out nothing, and plays as silence of its length.
//
// One programme: an AC-4 stream is sent to a sink whole, and a sink decodes
// the presentation it would choose with no preferences; ac4_presentation()
// says which the listener's choice would play, for the player to compare.
