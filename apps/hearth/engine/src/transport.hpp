// The transport state machine (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A3): play,
// pause, stop, next, previous and seek over the queue, and what the rest of
// the engine has to DO about each of them.
//
// Pure in the same way the output decision is, and for the same reason: it
// owns no thread, no device and no decoder. A command returns the new state
// plus the one action the caller should carry out, so every transition -
// including the ones that only happen at the end of a track, or when the
// queue changes underneath a playing item - is a case in
// apps/hearth/engine/tests/test_transport.cpp rather than something only reachable with a
// sound card and a stopwatch.
//
// Gapless lives here too, as the decision of whether the next item can join
// the output that is already open (the plan's Gapless playback section): the
// same rate and the same rendered width continue, and anything else reopens
// and says so. What that costs in samples at the join is the session's
// business - a raw elementary stream carries no encoder-delay field, so up to
// a frame of padding plus the 256-sample transform delay remains - and the
// note this returns is where the app gets the sentence to show.
