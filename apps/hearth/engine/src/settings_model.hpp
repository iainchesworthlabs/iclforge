// The engine's settings (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A3: "the
// settings model"): what the Settings page's Playback and Network cards hold,
// the queue kept for the next start, and the keys they are kept under.
//
// Keeping them is the window's: it stores its settings through QSettings
// (A5). This model reads and writes them through SettingsStore, which the
// window implements over QSettings and a test over a map. So what each value
// means, what it defaults to and what a damaged value becomes are decided
// here, once, and tested on every leg.
//
// The keys. Values are text, as QSettings writes them to a file:
//   playback/gapless       true or false
//   playback/resumeQueue   true or false
//   playback/onFailure     skip or stop
//   network/name           how sinks and players show this computer
//   network/discover       true or false
//   queue/...              the queue kept for the next start
//   speakers/...           the speaker setup kept for the next start
//   pairing/...            the pairing records (pairing_store.hpp)
//   identity/server        this computer's Sendspin server key (server_identity.hpp)
// Lists use QSettings' own array layout ("queue/size", then "queue/1/path"
// and so on, counted from 1), so the window can read them with its array
// functions as well. The diagnostics file withholds everything under
// "queue/", "pairing/" and "identity/" (diagnostics_report.hpp) - "speakers/"
// holds nothing a person typed (numbers and a layout/routing description), so
// it is not withheld.
