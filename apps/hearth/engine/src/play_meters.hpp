// Meters on what the output plays (planning/hearth-reference-player.md,
// Monitor): a level meter per output slot - peak, hold, RMS and a clip latch,
// iclforge::ac3::analysis::LevelMeter's - and the programme's loudness from
// iclforge::ac3::meta::LoudnessMeter, measured as the blocks are rendered and released
// only when the device's clock reaches them.
//
// The GUI's stream player meters each chunk as it is queued, so its meters run
// ahead of the sound by however much the device holds. Here each snapshot is
// stamped with the output frame its audio ends on, counted the way the
// device's clock counts, and a snapshot is only handed out once the clock -
// less the output path's delay - has passed that frame.
//
// Loudness is measured over the slots that name a Table E2.5 location, in
// BS.1770-5 Annex 3's weighting, the LFE excluded; a slot placed by angle
// alone has no location to weight and is left out of it.
//
// Each item has a loudness meter of its own, so its integrated loudness,
// loudness range and true peak are the item's alone. Momentary and short-term
// loudness describe what was just heard, so they run on through a gapless
// join: for a new item's first three seconds, the short-term window, they are
// read from the meter of the item before, which is fed the new item too. A
// flush or a reopen starts every meter again, since what they hold will not
// be heard.
//
// The library works integrated loudness and loudness range out over the whole
// programme at each read, at a cost that grows with the programme's length, so
// they are read once a second of audio and each snapshot carries the latest.
