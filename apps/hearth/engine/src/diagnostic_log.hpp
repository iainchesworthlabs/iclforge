// The diagnostics ring (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A3: "a
// diagnostics ring in Crucible's pattern", after
// apps/crucible/engine/src/diagnostics.hpp): a bounded ring of one-line notes that
// the player, the engine and the window write to, and the means of keeping
// paths out of it. diagnostics_report.hpp turns the ring into the file the
// Settings page saves.
//
// The page promises that pairing keys, codes and file paths are left out.
// A note the player or the engine composes names an item by its place in the
// queue and its title, never by its path. Text that arrives from elsewhere -
// what an item loader said about a file it could not read, which is free to
// quote the file's path - is scrubbed of that item's folder before it is
// noted, while the item is still in the queue to say what its path is.
//
// No Qt and no platform header: the engine's thread writes here, and iclforge-hearth-tests
// holds the rule on every CI leg.

// block. Each note is stamped "+ssss.mmm " (seconds since the log was made,
// by the steady clock, with more digits after 9999 s), has CR, LF and every
// other control character replaced by a space so that one note is one line
// of the file, and is cut to kMaxLine bytes, at a UTF-8 boundary and marked
