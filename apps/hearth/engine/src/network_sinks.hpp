// Discovery, connection, pairing and groups (planning/hearth-reference-player.md,
// A6). Owns this computer's Sendspin server identity, browses `_sendspin._tcp`,
// keeps a connection to each sink it can, pairs on request, and makes the
// groups a person builds on the Network page; the window polls status() and
// calls tick() the way HearthController polls Engine::status() (A5's own
// reason: no on_change() callback, so nothing here has to cross onto the Qt
// thread by itself).
//
// A row is a sink mDNS lists, keyed by its instance name, and it stays while
// mDNS lists it, a connection to it is live, or the owner keeps it through a
// firmware update (keep_sink()) - not only while this computer happens to be
// connected. What a sink last said about itself (its hello and support
// objects) is kept with the row, so a sink whose connection ended still reads
// as what it is.
//
// Connections. Every sink found is dialled. What it gets once it says hello is
// ServerHost's decision: a paired sink gets playback (so reconnecting to a
// sink this computer has paired with is meant to hold it - "this is now one of
// Hearth's own sinks"); any other waits with no activities. A sink another
// server holds refuses that wait (connection.md, Multiple servers: an
// activation with nothing declared ranks below any holder, bar the
// last-playback exception) with client/goodbye concurrent_attempt, and a
// connection displaced by another server's later activation ends with
// another_server: either way the row is marked held elsewhere and is NOT
// dialled again by itself - dialling a paired sink would take it back, and an
// unpaired one would only be refused again - until the person asks: pair it,
// take it back (connect_sink()), or look again (rescan()). Any other failure -
// the dial, the handshake, a connection that drops - is dialled again after a
// back-off (1, 2, 4, 8, 15, then every 30 seconds), driven by tick().
//
// Pairing is asked for explicitly (pair_sink()), never by selecting a row. On a
// connection that is waiting it starts at once (ServerHost::pair()); without one
// - the usual case for a sink another server holds - it dials to pair
// (ServerHost::dial_to_pair()), so the connection's first activation is the
// pairing, which the sink admits beside or over the other server rather than
// refusing. Only the dynamic six-digit code is offered: it is what the page
// takes, and what a Hearth sink shows on its own page and console.
//
// A group is membership and volume/mute only here - streaming a programme to
// one is Player's job (network_group_sink.hpp): this class only ever calls
// iclforge::sendspin::Group::add()/remove()/set_group_volume()/set_member_volume()
// and the like, never start()/push()/push_burst(). iclforge::sendspin::Group keeps
// no member list of its own to read back, so groups_ (below) is this class's
// own record of which of ITS sinks belong to which group, in sink-id terms
// (this class's mDNS-instance ids). A member only needs this computer to have
// heard its client_id once - a sink that has said hello, now or earlier in this
// run: Group::add() takes a client that is not connected, and starts it at the
// next audio pushed once it is (server_host.cpp's try_start()), so a sink that
// drops off Wi-Fi for a few seconds stays in every group it was in.
//
// A sink's own settings pages (issue #875, push_sink_settings()/
// push_sink_identify() below) need a live connection offering
// _iclforge_player@v1: ServerHost::iclforge_command() resolves by client_id
// alone (server_host.cpp), and ClientView carries iclforge_support/
// iclforge_state as soon as such a client connects, neither Group-gated.
//
// What A6 still does not have: a warning BEFORE this computer takes a paired
// sink that another server is playing to (network-in-use.png). The wire has no
// way to ask "is someone else using this" without claiming it (issue #876):
// only the displaced side hears of a displacement. What IS here is the after-
// the-fact half - held_elsewhere, from the goodbye reasons ServerHost passes on
// (ServerHostEvents::on_client_goodbye()).
