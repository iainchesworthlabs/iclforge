// Pure view-building for the Network page (planning/hearth-reference-player.md,
// A6: discovery and pairing - the first slice; see network_sinks.hpp's own
// comment for what is not here yet and why). Turning what NetworkSinks knows
// about a discovered Sendspin player into the strings the page reads is kept
// apart from NetworkSinks itself so it can be tested the way output_decision.hpp
// is - hand-built facts, no socket, no clock - while network_sinks.cpp, the
// harder-to-test layer that calls this from what ServerHost and discovery
// actually report, stays thin.
//
// A6's second slice (a Hearth sink's own speaker and decoder settings pages,
// planning/hearth-reference-player.md#a6-network-outputs-in-the-application)
// reads SinkFacts' iclforge_support/iclforge_state directly rather than through
// a new to_map()-style function here: unlike SinkRow/SinkDetail's plain display
// strings, the settings pages need editable numeric fields QML binds to, and
// HearthController's own decoder_settings_to_map()/from_map() (hearth_
// controller.cpp) already sets the precedent of doing that conversion in the
// Qt controller itself, not a separate hand-tested view layer - network_
// controller.cpp follows the same pattern for the same reason. iclforge_player.hpp
// is a lightweight, dependency-free header (no Qt, no iclforge::render), the same
// reason network_sinks.hpp already includes sendspin headers directly.
//
// Wording follows planning/hearth-sendspin-extension.md's own terms: "roles",
// "takes", "outputs", "latency" and "clock" are its words for client/hello's
// roles, the codecs and data types a sink accepts, its output slot count and
// width, its required lead time, and whether its time filter has converged.
