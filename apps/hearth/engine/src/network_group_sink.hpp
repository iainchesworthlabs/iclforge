// plain std::string rather than a sendspin type, and pcm_sink.hpp/
// bitstream_sink.hpp name no backend. GroupResolver only names

// Where a network group's programme goes (planning/hearth-reference-player.md,
// A6: "a group of two test sinks and the reference Python player plays one
// programme").
//
// A group needs BOTH forms from the one decode at once: rendered PCM for a
// member playing player@v1 (iclforge::sendspin::Group::push()), and the item's own
// coded units, packed into IEC 61937 bursts, for a member playing
// _iclforge_player@v1 (Group::push_burst()) - a mixed group takes both from
// the same session together (apps/hearth/engine/tests/test_group.cpp's own proof).
// Neither PcmSink nor BitstreamSink fits alone - pcm_sink.hpp's own comment
// says why: "a network group takes a stream... a seam of its own" - so this
// is its own interface rather than a third mode bent into either.
//
// push_burst() takes one whole burst at an absolute programme frame
// (iclforge::sendspin::Group::Burst::frame), not a running byte stream, so a
// caller does not have to keep the PCM and the bursts in lock-step - Player
// paces each independently (player.cpp), and this interface mirrors that:
// submit_pcm() and submit_burst() are unrelated calls, each with its own
// backpressure.
