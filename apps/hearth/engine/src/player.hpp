// The player (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A3): the queue, the
// transport, one session at a time, and a PCM sink, put together.
//
// The transport decides; this carries the decision out. Each command is
// forwarded to the transport, and the one action it returns is performed on
// the sink and the sessions. Audio moves only in pump(), which the
// application calls from its engine thread whenever the sink has room and a
// test calls in a loop against a fake device - so nothing here owns a thread,
// and a whole queue can be played deterministically, one pump at a time.
//
// Gapless, as the plan's section defines it: when the current item has
// delivered its last frame, the next item is opened straight away - before
// the transport is told the item finished, so the transport's join decision
// sees the next item's real rate rather than "not probed yet" - and if the
// transport would join it, the next item's first frame follows the last
// one's with nothing between them and nothing reopened. Otherwise - another
// format, or nothing next at all - the player waits for everything already
// submitted to be heard (by the sink's own clock) before telling the
// transport, so until the item's tail has been heard it is still the item
// playing: a pause or a seek there is the item's, and an item added to the
// queue meanwhile can still join. Then a reopen closes and opens the output
// at the new format, and a stop closes it. The record of where each item
// began in the output's timeline and how many frames it delivered is kept,
// which is what A3's exit checks at every join.
//
// Given a diagnostics ring (diagnostic_log.hpp), the player notes what it did
// and could not do: each output opened and closed, each item started, joined
// or refused, and units that would not decode - the first with its reason,
// the rest as a count once the item is done with, so a damaged file writes
// two lines rather than one per unit.
//
// Each item plays the way the output decision says (output_decision.hpp),
// asked when the item starts and again before the next one joins. A
// bitstream output is sent the item's access units, packed into IEC 61937
// bursts, from the same units the decoder is given: the decode still runs,
// for the meters and the unit reports, which are released by the
// bitstream sink's clock as they are by a PCM sink's. Only whole units can be
// sent, so a bitstreamed item plays every sample of the units its part of
// the stream touches (Session::play_whole_units()), and the decoder settings
// reach the meters but not the receiver, which decodes with its own.
//
// An item transcoded to AC-3 for a receiver that takes nothing newer is
// decoded onto 5.1 with neutral settings instead, and those blocks are what
// the meters measure and what Ac3Transcoder encodes. The link carries the
// encoder's frames, whose output runs its 256-sample delay behind the decode,
// so everything on the link is placed that much later; the decode can cut,
// so the item plays exactly its part and a join is seamless through the one
// encoder. What the encoder still holds when the output plays out or reopens
// is padded out and sent first.
//
// A network group (A6) takes both at once, from the one decode: rendered PCM
// for a member playing player@v1, and the item's own units, packed into
// bursts the same way a bitstream output's are, for a member playing
// _iclforge_player@v1 - network_group_sink.hpp's own comment has the shape.
// An AC-4 item (planning/ac4.md, I2) is decoded for every output and reaches
// a member as a bitstream only this way: a sync frame to a burst, packed by
// iclforge::containers::iec61937::Ac4BurstPacker in the burst type the item's largest frame
// needs, each burst placed at its frame's own start on the item's timeline.
// A member decodes the presentation it would choose with no preferences, so
// an item whose listener has chosen another is sent as PCM alone, as another
// programme of an E-AC-3 stream is.
// The two are unrelated deliveries of the same audio rather than one split
// between two outputs, so this player's usual per-session bookkeeping
// (submitted_since_open_, the history, position()) follows the PCM side only,
// exactly as it would for a local device - the bursts are a second, entirely
// independent channel to the same members (send_unit_to_group(),
// drain_group()). A seek is consequently not click-free here the way a local
// device's is: NetworkGroupSink::flush() cannot recall bytes already sent
// over the wire, only reset what this player itself still holds.
