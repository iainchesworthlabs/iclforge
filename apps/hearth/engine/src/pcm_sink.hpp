// Where a session's rendered audio goes (planning/hearth-reference-player.md,
// A3).
//
// The engine talks to this and never to a platform API. One implementation
// drives iclforge::audio::PcmOutput (A2), which opens a local device at its own
// width and places each rendered slot by the device's speakers; iclforge-hearth-tests has
// another, a fake device with a clock of its own, which is what A3's exit
// needs - "a queue of mixed containers plays to a fake device gaplessly, with
// the expected sample count at every join" - and what makes the player's
// behaviour at a join checkable without a sound card or a stopwatch.
//
// A PCM sink only. A bitstream output takes packed bursts rather than
// rendered blocks (bitstream_sink.hpp), and a network group takes a stream;
// each has a seam of its own, rather than a single interface with a payload
// that means different things depending on the mode.
