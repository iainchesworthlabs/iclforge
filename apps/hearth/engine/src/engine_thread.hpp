// The engine thread (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A3): a Player on a
// thread of its own, driven by commands from any other thread, reporting what
// it did as snapshots any other thread can read.
//
// The Player is single-threaded by design - every judgement in it assumes one
// caller - so once the engine has started, its thread is the only one that
// touches it. A command is queued and returns at once; the engine thread
// carries commands out in the order they were queued, between pumps. The
// window posts commands and reads status(); nothing it does waits on the
// audio, and nothing the audio does waits on the window.
//
// While an output is open the engine pumps once per EngineTiming::period and
// waits on its command queue in between, so a command is carried out within
// a period; a device sink's own buffer spans many periods. With nothing open
// it sleeps until a command arrives.
//
// After every batch of commands, and after every pump that started an item,
// reopened or closed the output or had something to say, the engine publishes
// a snapshot - the queue, the transport, the settings, the history - and calls
// the change callback on its own thread. The play position moves with every
// pump and is kept apart, so a position slider does not copy the list a
// thousand times a second.
//
// Given a diagnostics ring (diagnostic_log.hpp), the engine notes each
// command as its thread carries it out, and anything the transport said
// about it; the player notes what playback did in between.
