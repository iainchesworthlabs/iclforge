// The play queue (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, Media): the items the
// player was given, in the order they will play, and which one is current.
//
// Deliberately a plain container with no I/O in it. An item arrives as a path
// and gains what a probe found out about it - format, width, rate, duration -
// and nothing here reads a file, so the whole of the queue's behaviour is
// testable on any machine. The probe itself belongs to the session that
// opens the item.
//
// What "current" means when the queue is empty, when the current item is
// removed under the transport's feet, and when a folder's worth of items is
// added mid-play are all decided here rather than in the transport, because
// they are questions about a list rather than about playback.
