// Each item's output, decided (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A3).
//
// choose_output() is pure; this gathers what it decides from. An endpoint's
// row comes from two readings, kept apart as sink_capabilities.hpp keeps
// them:
//   * the platform's probe: enumerate_render_devices() opens each format and
//     says whether it could;
//   * where the platform has a reader, the sink's own descriptor:
//     read_sink_capabilities().
// A format counts as carried only when both allow it. The descriptor says what
// the receiver decodes, and the probe says what this machine can open - an
// HDMI output on ALSA opens any IEC 61937 format, whatever the receiver
// behind it takes. An endpoint that reports no descriptor carries no
// bitstream, since nothing is known of the sink behind it.
//
// The readings are taken once per sample rate, since the probe answers for
// one. They are kept until refresh(), which the engine calls when a render
// device comes, goes or changes (iclforge::audio::RenderDeviceWatch). Each item
// after that is decided against the machine as it is then: the appliance
// plan's gaps 3 and 5.
//
// A probe cannot see past an output this player holds open: the device reads
// as busy, and a link reads as refusing the very format it carries. So the
// endpoint the player holds (HeldOutput) keeps the record of its last reading
// taken while it was free, with a fresh descriptor, and anything read while
// an output is held is read again once it is not. Without that, a refresh
// while bitstreaming would move the item off its own link, and closing the
// link would move it back. An enumeration that finds nothing is taken as a
// failure to look, not as a machine with no outputs: the last list stands.
//
// One thread's: the engine's.
