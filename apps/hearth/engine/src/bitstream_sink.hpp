// Where a bitstreamed item goes (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, A3:
// "Passthrough, reusing PassthroughSink").
//
// The PCM sink's counterpart for the other kind of payload: IEC 61937
// bursts, each one AC-3 frame or six E-AC-3 blocks' worth of access units,
// already packed. The engine packs them (iclforge::containers::iec61937::wrap_frame and
// Eac3BurstPacker) and talks to this, never to a platform API. One
// implementation drives iclforge::audio::PassthroughSink; iclforge-tests has a fake with
// a clock of its own, as it has for the PCM sink.
//
// Every figure a sink reports is in the CONTENT's frames - 1536 to a burst
// in either format - as PassthroughSink::position() counts them, so the
// player's timeline is the same arithmetic whichever sink it is feeding.
