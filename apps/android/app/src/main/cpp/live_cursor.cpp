// The encode loop: this app's first real "live cursor" - the first place in
// the whole iclforge project that drives AtmosEncoder::encode_frame() from a
// live, externally-set position every frame rather than from an authored
// KeyframePath/OrbitPath or a file. Modeled directly on forge's run_live
// (apps/cli/main.cpp) - same per-frame shape (build placement, encode_frame,
// IEC61937-wrap, PassthroughSink::submit with retry+sleep) - but self-paced
// by wall clock instead of run_live's "block on the capture ring buffer"
// mechanism, because this app synthesizes its own object audio; there is no
// upstream producer to drain.
//
// kObjects objects: kInteractiveObjects (currently 1) that a pre-planned
// trajectory carries around the room on its own, with input from
// InputController.kt biasing them off that course - held input pushes,
// releasing it lets the object spring back onto the trajectory (see
// LiveCursorState::deflect_selected/advance below) - plus kAmbientObjects
// that follow their own trajectory untouched by input at all, for the sound
// mixing/interaction a single moving voice can't demonstrate on its own. The
// encode loop calls LiveCursorState::advance() once per frame - this is the
// actual "live cursor" the file is named for.
//
// Audible even unsigned: AtmosEncoder pans every object into the
// transmitted 5.1 bed (see atmos.hpp's header comment) - a legacy/non-JOC
// decode still hears it panned across the fixed channel layout, it just
// cannot reconstruct the object as a separate height-rendered source. The
// object signer (a per-frame pass keyed on the bundled signing.key asset) is
// what closes that gap; see run_loop()'s emit_objects
// (shield::signing_available()) for what an unsigned build does instead.
//
// Real-time viability history: this was briefly a pre-encode-then-loop-a-
// buffer diagnostic, because AtmosEncoder::encode_frame() measured at
// ~266ms/frame on this Shield's SoC - traced (Tracy) to the forward MDCT
// recomputing std::cos() fresh inside an O(N^2) loop instead of using a
// precomputed table the way the inverse transform already did (see
// libs/ac3/src/core/mdct.cpp's ForwardCosTable). Fixed there, not worked
// around here - this is the straight per-frame loop again.

//     Dolby's"), so a per-object SNR here would hold constant precisely the
//     variable most likely to explain a disagreement with a real decoder.
//     Nothing of the kind is computed.
//   * The decoded POSITION is an algebraic identity, not a discovery -
//     libs/ac3/tests/oba/test_atmos.cpp asserts decoded == the encoder's own
//     quantize_xy/quantize_z of the intended position. It is shown because
//     the QUANTISER is the interesting part: height travels in 16 steps and
//     left/right in 63, which is visible as a staircase against a smooth
//     intended line and is a fact about the format rather than a claim about
//     this encoder.
//   * What IS falsifiable: that the container survives on the wire at all,
//     and that OBJECTS OFF really removes it - a decoder reading the
//     post-strip bytes and reporting zero objects is independent of the byte
//     counter that claims it.
//
// `skip_reconstruction` is what makes this safe rather than merely cheap. It
// returns before the IMDCT, the overlap-add and JOC reconstruction, so no
// cross-frame state is carried and frames are mutually INDEPENDENT: the ring
// below may drop under load without corrupting anything that is drawn. A full

// The lead object's voice: a plain sine, however correctly panned, is a

//  - A single continuous tone with no onsets gives the ear a weak azimuth
