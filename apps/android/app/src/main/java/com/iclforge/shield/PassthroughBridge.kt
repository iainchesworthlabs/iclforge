/**
 * Owns the Java `android.media.AudioTrack` that actually bitstreams IEC 61937
 * to the HDMI/S-PDIF output - the delivery mechanism
 * `iclforge::audio::PassthroughSink`'s Android backend
 * (libs/audio/src/backend/android/passthrough.cpp) calls into over JNI. See
 * that file's header comment for the exact contract this class implements
 * (method names/signatures are part of the JNI ABI - do not rename/reshape
 * without updating both sides).
 *
 * Opened with [AudioFormat.ENCODING_IEC61937], not `ENCODING_E_AC3`: the
 * native side already hands this class complete, pre-wrapped IEC 61937
 * bursts (`iclforge::containers::iec61937::wrap_frame`/`Eac3BurstPacker::push`'s output), and
 * `ENCODING_E_AC3` would tell Android to wrap them AGAIN, corrupting the
 * stream. `carrierRateHz` in every method below is already the physical
 * carrier rate (content rate for AC-3, 4x it for E-AC-3), computed once in
 * C++ (`android_support.hpp`'s `carrier_rate`) - this class never multiplies
 * by 4 itself, matching the native side's header comment.
 *
 * `AudioTrack.isDirectPlaybackSupported(AudioFormat, AudioAttributes)` is
 * deprecated in favor of `AudioManager.getDirectPlaybackSupport()`, which
 * needs API 33+ - this app's minSdk is 26 for AAudio (see
 * app/build.gradle.kts), and this specific Shield is API 30, so the
 * deprecated static method is the only one that exists on the actual
 * target hardware. Suppressed deliberately, not an oversight.
 *
 * The `codeql[java/deprecated-call]` entry alongside `DEPRECATION` is load-
 * bearing, not decorative: a same-line/preceding-line `// codeql[...]`
 * comment (tried first, at each of the three call sites below) never
 * suppressed alerts #144-146 - GitHub's alert-suppression comment matching
 * did not fire for this Kotlin source. The annotation form is what
 * `@SuppressWarnings({"deprecation", "codeql[query-id]"})` actually means in
 * CodeQL's own AlertSuppressionAnnotations query, and a class-scoped
 * `@Suppress` covers every call site inside it - see that query for why this
 * is the array entry that registers, not the comment.

     * Without it, [submit] reads the field into a local and then calls `write`

     * Held across `write` deliberately: `WRITE_NON_BLOCKING` bounds how long
     * that can take, so the worst case is a teardown waiting out one
