// apps/shared/media/src/sink_wait.hpp: how forge's play, monitor, identify and live
// wait on a sink. None of those commands reaches its wait without a render
// device, and a device cannot be pulled on a CI runner, so these cases hold
// the waits against sinks that refuse and stop on cue. That a real sink stops
// itself when its device goes is the backends' part, and the hidden
// "[passthrough-unplug]" and "[monitor-unplug]" cases are where a person
// checks it.
