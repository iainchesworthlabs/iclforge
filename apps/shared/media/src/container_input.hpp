// Turning a container file into the elementary stream iclforge::ac3 actually
// decodes (container readers (mkv/mp4/ts)) - shared by forge (decode/qc/levels/play/monitor)
// and forge-gui (the QC/Inspect pickers), compiled straight into both the same
// way RecordingSink/Fmp4FolderWriter beside this file are: apps/common has no
// library target of its own (see recording_sink.hpp's own comment), and this
// is smaller than either.
//
// Lives here rather than in iclforge::ac3 itself:
// iclforge::containers::matroska/iclforge::containers::mp4/ iclforge::containers::mpegts each say
// plainly they have no dependency on iclforge::ac3 (see e.g. matroska/reader.hpp's own header
// comment) - the containers are deliberately independent of the codec, and giving the codec library
// a dependency back on them would invert that for every third party that links iclforge::ac3 to
// decode bare elementary streams and wants nothing else. This file depends on both instead, which
// is fine at this layer - apps/common already does for RecordingSink (ac3/io/wav.hpp,
// ac3/iec61937/iec61937.hpp) - since disambiguating a container from a bare elementary stream is
// exactly where knowing both sides earns its keep (see ContainerKind's own comment).

// Which container a file actually is, decided by its first bytes rather than
// its name - a rip is as likely to be called "title00.mkv" when it is not
// one as it is to have no extension at all. `head` needs only the first few
// KiB; a whole file works too but is wasted effort. kUnknown covers a bare
// elementary stream (or a WAV, for the callers that also accept one), which
// is most of what either caller actually sees.
//
// The MPEG-TS check is the loosest of the three - it has no magic, only a
// recurring sync byte - and a bare AC-3/E-AC-3 stream can satisfy it by
// accident: at some common bitrate/rate pairs (48 kbit/s at 48 kHz codes
// exactly 192-byte frames, one of the three grid strides) a low-entropy
// signal encodes near-identical bytes every frame, which looks exactly like
// a packet grid to a check that only counts recurrence (tools/ci/
// fuzz_encoder_space.py's REGRESSION_SEEDS, seed 3600083275727211684, found
// this for real). sniff_container's implementation checks for a genuine,
// syntactically-valid AC-3/E-AC-3 frame header first, which no accidental
// byte pattern satisfies the way a single recurring byte can - see its own
// comment. A RIFF/RF64/BW64 WAVE file is likewise recognised by its magic
// before the grid (steady PCM repeats bytes at a fixed period too), and the
// grid itself must start within the first packet stride, as any capture's
// does.
