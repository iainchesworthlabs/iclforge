// Waiting on an iclforge::audio sink without waiting for ever.
//
// A sink's submit() refuses for two reasons. Its queue is full, which time
// cures: the caller is ahead of real time and should wait. Or it is not
// running, which nothing cures: it stopped itself because its device went
// away (PassthroughSink::running(), MonitorSink::running()). A loop that
// retries on a refusal has to tell the two apart, and so does one waiting for
// the queue to play out, since a stopped sink's counts never move again.
// forge's play, monitor, identify and live all wait both ways.
//
// Templates over the sink, since PassthroughSink, MonitorSink and PcmOutput
// share the shape but no base class. Compiled straight into forge and
// iclforge-app-media-tests, as stream_playback.hpp beside it is, so a test can hold both
// helpers against a sink that stops on cue: no command reaches its wait
// without a render device, and no device can be pulled on a CI runner.
