// An AC-4 presentation's objects rendered to speakers by the renderer Hearth
// plays E-AC-3's objects through, iclforge::render::LayoutRenderer. The AC-4
// decoder hands each object over with the properties its metadata sets (ETSI
// TS 103 190-2 Annex F) for an application to render; this is forge's
// rendering, kept apart from apps/forge/cli/src so that a test holds it and so that
// Hearth's engine can take it up when it decodes AC-4. Compiled straight into
// forge and iclforge-tests, as stream_playback.cpp beside it is.
//
// A dynamic object is panned from its position (X from the left wall to the
// right, Y from the front wall to the back, Z from the floor through the
// screen's height to the ceiling, which is the system of TS 103 420 that
// iclforge::spatial::position_direction reads) at its gain, silent while inactive;
// a bed object, the LFE and the frame's own channels (a presentation's
// channel-coded substreams, or the intermediate spatial format the decoder
// rendered) go to their speakers, panned onto the layout where it lacks one.
// An update takes effect at its sample and each speaker's gain moves to it
// linearly over the update's ramp. Width, divergence, zones, snapping and the
// screen factor are not rendered, as the layout renderer renders none of them
// for E-AC-3.
