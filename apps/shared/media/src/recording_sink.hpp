// Streams a recording's encoded frames to their destination as they are
// produced, for the containers whose format allows it - which is what turns
// a take's memory footprint from "the whole session" (~3.4 MB per minute at
// 448 kbps, unbounded until Stop) into one frame, and puts the take's bytes
// on disk continuously instead of only at a clean stop, so a crash an hour
// in no longer loses the hour.
//
// The five containers here are exactly the streamable ones: a bare
// elementary stream appends; Matroska streams via iclforge::containers::matroska::Writer (EBML's
// own unknown-size Segment pattern - the file differs from the one-shot
// mux()'s by exactly that, as that class's comment describes); MPEG-TS via
// iclforge::containers::mpegts::Writer (whose bytes are contract-identical to mux()'s); fragmented
// MP4/CMAF into a DIRECTORY rather than a file, through the Fmp4FolderWriter
// EncoderController's own live session shares (whose media segments are
// likewise contract-identical to iclforge::containers::mp4::fragment()'s);
// the IEC 61937 WAV carrier via per-frame wrapping into
// iclforge::ac3::io::WavPcm16StreamWriter, whose closed file is byte-identical to
// write_wav_pcm16_raw over the same bursts. Plain MP4 is the one deliberately
// absent: moov/stco need every frame's final offset, so the
// accumulate-then-mux shape in EncoderController::writeOutput IS its design,
// and the recording loop keeps that shape for it.
//
// Qt-free on purpose: everything here is std:: and the container libraries,
// so tests' plain C++ test can drive it against the one-shot writers without
// a QML engine in the room. Errors come back as the user-facing strings
// EncoderController's status line already shows - empty means fine.
//
// Shared by BOTH front ends since wide-layout record/live paths, which is why it lives in
// apps/common rather than apps/gui: `forge record`/`forge live` write their
// takes through this same class, so a CLI take and a GUI take of the same
// container are the same bytes produced the same way, and the crash-safety
// and bounded-memory properties above are one implementation rather than
// two. Neither app owns it; both compile it in directly (there is no
// library target to link, the same arrangement the CLI's own support.cpp
// has).
