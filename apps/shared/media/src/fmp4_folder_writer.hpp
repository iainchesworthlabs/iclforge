// Writes a fragmented MP4/CMAF FOLDER as encoded access units arrive, through
// iclforge::containers::mp4::FragmentWriter: init.mp4, one segment<N>.m4s each time a fragment
// closes, and audio.m3u8/master.m3u8/manifest.mpd rewritten beside them on
// every close. Live-shaped while the take runs - no #EXT-X-ENDLIST, a
// type="dynamic" MPD with an availabilityStartTime, so the folder is a
// servable origin mid-take - and closed to the VOD/static forms by close().
//
// Shared by every write-as-you-go path in BOTH front ends: RecordingSink
// (apps/cli's record/live and the GUI's Record button take, both via
// RecordingSink::Container::kFmp4) and the GUI's own live session
// (EncoderController's LiveOutputWriters). fMP4 is the one container all
// three reach for the same code here rather than each growing its own copy -
// which a fourth, near-identical copy in forge (apps/cli/support.hpp's
// Fmp4SessionWriter) used to be, before moving this class to apps/common
// gave it the same shared home RecordingSink already has.
//
// Qt-free on purpose, matching RecordingSink: everything here is std:: and
// iclforge::containers::mp4::, so tests' plain C++ test drives it without a QML engine. Errors
// come back as user-facing strings - empty means fine.
