// Single source of truth for colour, spacing and type, so every page and
// component stays visually consistent. Tokens follow the Modernist design
// system: zero radius everywhere, an Archivo type scale, and colour ramps in
// two families (neutral and accent), each 100 (nearest the background) to
// 900 (highest contrast against it).
//
// There are several PALETTES now, each defining BOTH modes by hand. Dark
// used to be derived by mechanically inverting the light ramp's HSL
// lightness, and it looked like it: near-white accent tints inverted into
// murky red-blacks and the fully saturated accent stayed glaring against
// near-black. A dark palette needs raised lightness floors, softened
// saturation and warm (not pure-black) surfaces - colour choices, not
// arithmetic - so each palette carries a hand-tuned dark ramp instead.
//
// The "system" palette takes its accent from the DESKTOP's own accent
// colour (SystemTheme.accentColor - QPalette::Accent, which Qt's platform
// themes fill natively on Windows/macOS/KDE and fall back to Highlight
// elsewhere) and derives its accent ramp from that one colour; its
// neutrals are the pure-grey set, so any hue the OS supplies sits cleanly.
//
// Every component binds to a token name (Theme.neutral800, Theme.accent...)
// and gets whichever palette and mode are active; nothing outside this file
// knows how many palettes there are, and nothing outside this file may know
// either.
