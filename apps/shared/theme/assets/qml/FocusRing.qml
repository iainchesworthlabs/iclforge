import QtQuick

import ForgeGui

// The ring that says where the keyboard is. Put one inside any hand-drawn
// control and it draws just outside that control's own border while the
// control has active focus:
//
//     Rectangle { ... the chip's own fill and border ...
//         FocusRing {}
//     }
//
// Shared by both windows (apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt copies this file into
// the Crucible's own QML module and rewrites the import), so the examples
// name neither: Crucible's CrucibleButton/CrucibleCheck and forge-gui's bed,
// low-frequency, tab, run and command-line chips all carry one the same way.
// The controls that are not hand-drawn - forge-gui's extras checkboxes, every
// plain Button - draw the style's own focus indicator instead and have no
// ring of their own; SegmentedControl draws a third kind, on whichever
// segment is current, for the reason its own comment gives.
//
// Zero radius and the accent-derived focusRing colour, per the design
// system; the offset keeps it clear of the control's 1 px border instead of
// replacing it, so a focused control still reads as the control it was.
//
// `active` is the parent's active focus by default. A control whose ring
// belongs to something other than its immediate parent - a ListView, whose
// visual children are reparented into its scrolling content item, so the
// ring goes on a wrapper instead - overrides it.
//
// The ring shows for ANY active focus, not only for focus that arrived by
// Tab: a mouse click on a button or a segment does not take focus here (the
// MouseAreas do not ask for it), so a mouse user sees no rings, while a
// click on the application list or a room marker DOES take focus, because
// that is where the arrow keys continue from, and a ring there is the truth.
