// The minimum-footprint decoder probe (minimum-footprint decoder profile): iclforge::ac3_minimal
// decoding real bitstreams on a target with no operating system, no
// filesystem and no C++ exceptions, and reporting what that cost.
//
// It is not a demo and not a unit test. It answers the three questions the
// profile exists to answer, in a place where an answer cannot be fudged by
// the host environment:
//
//   1. Does the decode-only archive LINK at all with the encoder, the
//      containers, the I/O layer and the direct-form transform tables absent?
//      A missing symbol here is a fact about the source list in
//      src/ac3/minimal.cmake, and --gc-sections means an unreachable
//      function cannot paper over one.
//
//   2. Does it produce the right audio? Every frame of every fixture in
//      apps/baremetal/fixture.hpp is decoded and each channel's RMS compared
//      against what the same library produced on the host.
//
//   3. What does it actually cost? Peak heap in bytes, allocation counts split
//      between the first frame and the steady state, and the static working
//      set. These are the numbers docs/performance-trend.md's footprint table
//      carries, printed by the thing being measured rather than estimated.
//
// The output is machine-readable (`key=value` lines) so the CI leg can gate on
// it; tools/checks/footprint_report.py parses the same lines.
