# Fmt.cmake
#
# Defines an INTERFACE target `iclforge::fmt` wrapping {fmt} (`fmt::fmt`) - the
# formatting library this project uses everywhere instead of std::format/
# std::print. NDK r26's bundled libc++ (LLVM 17) does not implement <format>
# at all unless the compiler is invoked with -fexperimental-library, which
# nothing in this project's Android build passes (see
# docs/platforms/android.md); {fmt} has no such gap, since it depends on
# nothing libc++ gates behind that flag.
#
# Unlike Tracy.cmake, this is NOT opt-in: {fmt} is a base dependency, always
# resolved, the same way Catch2 is for ICLFORGE_BUILD_TESTS builds (see
# tests/CMakeLists.txt, whose find-then-FetchContent-fallback shape this
# mirrors). Desktop builds get it from vcpkg (see vcpkg.json's base
# "dependencies"); the Android app build never wires vcpkg's toolchain in at
# all (apps/android/app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt has no vcpkg/VCPKG
# reference anywhere), so it silently takes the FetchContent fallback below -
# {fmt} is a plain CMake/C++ library and builds cleanly under the NDK
# toolchain with no further plumbing needed, unlike bolting vcpkg's own
# Android triplet chainloading on for this one dependency.
#
# A second target, iclforge::fmt_private, is defined at the end of this file. The
# libraries installed as static archives (iclforge::ac3, iclforge::containers) link it in place
# of iclforge::fmt.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Matches packaging/vcpkg-port/iclforge/vcpkg.json's own fmt dependency and
# packaging/conan/conanfile.py's pinned requirement, so all three routes
# build against the same code. fmt's own git tags carry no "v" prefix
# (unlike Catch2's), hence GIT_TAG "${ICLFORGE_FMT_VERSION}" below, not
# "v${ICLFORGE_FMT_VERSION}".

# 11.0.x's fmt/chrono.h then fails with "call to consteval function

# iclforge::fmt_private - a private copy of {fmt}, compiled into the object files of a library that is
# installed as a static archive: iclforge::ac3 (libs/ac3/CMakeLists.txt) and iclforge::containers
# (libs/containers/CMakeLists.txt).
#
# An archive is not linked. Each function its objects call without defining stays an undefined
# reference until a consumer's own link, and the installed package names no {fmt} for that link to
# find. Linking iclforge::fmt privately, as those two libraries did, therefore left an installed
# libiclforge_ac3_static.a and libmp4_static.a with undefined fmt::v12::vformat and fmt::v12::vprint
# references, and a program linking iclforge::c_static from `cmake --install`'s output stopped at
# "undefined reference to fmt::v12::vprint". A shared library takes {fmt} in at its own link, so
# only the static variants showed it.
#
# Declaring the dependency on the exported targets instead (find_dependency(fmt) plus a link item)
# does not hold for every way this file finds {fmt}. The FetchContent copy is an ordinary target
# that is in no export set, so install(EXPORT) refuses it and the configure step fails. The {fmt}
# a consumer finds also has to be this build's major version, which is part of every symbol name
# (fmt::v12::), so a consumer whose only copy is another major version, such as Ubuntu 26.04's
# libfmt-dev 10.1.1, still ends at an undefined reference.
#
# FMT_HEADER_ONLY makes {fmt}'s definitions part of each including translation unit, so the archive
# carries them and no fmt:: symbol is left undefined. $<COMPILE_ONLY:> keeps what iclforge::fmt supplies
# for compiling (include path, SYSTEM marking, /wd4702) and drops the link: no {fmt} library
# reaches a link line, and a shared {fmt} adds no NEEDED entry to libiclforge_ac3.so.
#
# The definitions go in their own inline namespace, fmt::ac3_private, through FMT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE
# and FMT_END_NAMESPACE, the hooks {fmt} provides for embedding it in a library. Without that the
# archive holds weak definitions of fmt::v12::vprint and vformat, and a weak definition in an
# archive member satisfies every other object's reference to the same name: iclforge-tests, which
# compiles cpu_features.cpp a second time, had the archive's cpu_features.cpp.o pulled in for
# fmt::v12::vprint and stopped at a duplicate iclforge::internal::cpu::has_avx2, in the static build and
# in the BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON pass alike. A member pulled in without a clash would put a copy of
# this library's code in a test binary that is meant to run against libiclforge_ac3.so. The private
# copy answers to this library's own code alone, and a consumer's {fmt}, of any version, never
# binds to it.
#
# Every translation unit of these libraries gets the definitions, whichever fmt header it
# includes: with FMT_HEADER_ONLY, fmt/base.h ends by including fmt/format.h (11.1.0 through
# 12.2.0). A library that goes back to linking iclforge::fmt privately is what
# tools/checks/check_install_consumer.sh finds, by linking every installed archive whole.
# Applications, tests and examples keep linking iclforge::fmt: they are executables, so no later link
# is left to resolve anything. The FMT_*_NAMESPACE definitions contain spaces and braces, which
# the Ninja generator (Linux and Windows) and the Unix Makefiles generator (Linux) quote
# correctly; every preset here uses Ninja, and no other generator has been tried.
