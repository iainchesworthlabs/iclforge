# add_custom_command() does NOT run its COMMAND through a shell, so a plain
# `... man > forge.1` in one would hand ">" and "forge.1" to the process as
# two ordinary arguments rather than redirecting anything. This is the
# portable stand-in: execute_process()'s own OUTPUT_FILE does the redirect,
# and `cmake -P` is available by definition wherever CMake is.

# A non-zero exit is a hard error: a half-written or empty man page that the
# packaging step then installs is exactly the silent failure worth refusing.
