# Cortex-M3 on QEMU's mps2-an385 board: an ARM reference platform QEMU models
# faithfully, with semihosting for stdout and an exit code, and 4 MB of flash
# and RAM. Cortex-M3 specifically, not something larger - it has no FPU at
# all, so every double in this codec is software-emulated and the profile is
# measured on the least forgiving target it plausibly ships to rather than on
# one that flatters it.
#
# Unlike the other toolchain files here this one is NOT chainloaded through
# vcpkg: there is no vcpkg triplet for bare-metal arm, nothing this profile
# builds has a third-party dependency, and the minimal profile turns off every
# component that would want one (see the guard in the root CMakeLists.txt).
# The wasm toolchain sits outside vcpkg for the same reason.
