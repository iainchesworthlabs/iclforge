#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# macOS LLVM/Clang Toolchain Configuration
#
# Chainloaded by the config-macos-llvm* presets via
# VCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE. LLVM 22 is the pinned version.
#
# Deliberately prefers Homebrew/MacPorts LLVM over Apple's bundled clang: the
# codec leans on C++23 library features (std::to_chars, <format>, ranges) whose
# availability in Apple's libc++ is gated on the deployment target. Where an
# LLVM libc++ is found it is used in place of the SDK's for exactly that reason.
#
# NOTE: written from the aqualink-automate reference; this project still has
# no local macOS host, but CI (.github/workflows/_build.yml's macos-llvm leg,
# on macos-latest/Apple Silicon) has run this for real and found the Homebrew
# LLVM it's written to find - see docs/building.md's Verified configuration
# section for the actual numbers.

# CMake applies CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS to CXX sources only, so without this line

# neighbours but with a different standard library configuration - see the
# libc++ block below, which is the part that actually matters. Set

# are read when it is, wherever the enable_language() call happens to sit.

# to prevent, since a target built against two standard libraries would show
# up at link or at run time and neither leg has been made to do it deliberately.
