# Copies the family's shared QML components (apps/shared/theme/assets/qml/*.qml: Theme, Card,
# SectionHeader, StatTile, AppButton, AppCheckBox, IconButton, AppSlider, AppTextField, AppComboBox, RailBlock,
# SegmentedControl, FocusRing) into a Qt
# application's own assets/qml/shared/ directory, rewriting `import ForgeGui` to that
# application's own module URI (Forge GUI's own is ForgeGui, so its copies are the sources byte
# for byte) - generated INTO the source tree (ignored by
# git) rather than the
# build tree, because the QML ahead-of-time compiler names its cache files
# after the path relative to the source directory, and a build-tree path
# produces an unusable name with a drive letter in the middle of it.
#
# apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt, apps/hearth/ui/CMakeLists.txt and apps/forge/gui/CMakeLists.txt
# all call this instead of each running its own copy of the loop, which is how this
# file came to exist: Crucible and Hearth each used to compute their own source path
# (${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../gui/qml/<name> and .../../../gui/qml/<name>
# respectively) and register it via set_property(DIRECTORY APPEND PROPERTY
# CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS ...) in its own directory scope. Both spellings
# resolve to the same file, but CMake tracks CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS entries
# by their literal, unnormalised string, so both landed - unmerged - in
# Ninja's single generated "re-run CMake if these change" phony-output edge.
# Ninja canonicalises paths when it loads the graph, finds that one file
# declared as that edge's output twice, and refuses to load build.ninja -
# a configure-time success that only fails at the next `ninja` invocation,
# with the duplicate hidden inside one very long generated line (a plain text
# search of build.ninja for the file name is not enough to find it - the
# giveaway is running the actual combined build).
#
# Routing every caller through one function, keyed off CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
# (constant everywhere) rather than any caller's own CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR,
# and tracking already-registered sources in a GLOBAL property so a second
# caller skips the set_property call entirely, is what actually prevents the
# collision - a future third app copying the old inline loop would
# reintroduce it. Registering the dependency from whichever caller runs first
# is enough: CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS's effect (mark the whole build for
# reconfiguration when the file changes) is project-wide regardless of which
# directory's scope it was registered from.
#
# module_uri:    this application's `import <uri>` replacement, e.g. Crucible
# out_dir:       where the rewritten copies are written, e.g. .../ui/assets/qml/shared
# out_files_var: name of a variable (in the caller's scope) to receive the
#                list of generated file paths
