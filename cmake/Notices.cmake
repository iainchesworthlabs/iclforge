# Assembles a third-party notices file at configure time from plain-text
# fragments, so the one file a package installs and an application embeds
# is written once, from the versions CMake already knows, rather than kept
# by hand per platform. notices/crucible/, notices/forge/ and notices/hearth/ are
# its three users, one per product, over the one directory of fragments, notices/fragments/.
#
# FRAGMENT_DIR still takes more than one directory, searched in order, though
# every caller passes the one. A fragment that names no application - the
# typefaces, the trademark line, and {fmt} once the binaries it is compiled
# into are a token - is the same paragraph for every product, and keeping
# copies is how they come to disagree. A fragment that describes what a
# package CONTAINS is never shared - the Qt sections, the header and the
# Windows runtime section differ per product, and are named for it
# (forge-header, crucible-header, hearth-header, forge-windows-runtime,
# crucible-windows-runtime, hearth-fonts).
#
# Substitution is string(REPLACE) on {{TOKEN}} markers, deliberately not
# configure_file(@ONLY): licence texts must stay byte-exact, and copyright
# lines carry '@' in e-mail addresses. Every expansion of a variable that
# holds licence text is quoted, because the texts contain semicolons.
#
# Failure is loud, at configure. A fragment the caller names that does not
# exist, a {{FILE:NAME}} whose file is missing, and any {{TOKEN}} still in
# the output - a token nobody supplied, or a licence file that is still the
# placeholder its first line says it is - each stop the configure with a
# message naming the culprit. A token the fragments never mention is fine:
# the caller passes every version it knows and the platform's fragments use
# the ones that apply.
#
# Line endings are normalised to LF whatever the checkout's autocrlf did, so
# the generated file is byte-identical on every platform that builds it, and
# every fragment and licence file read is a configure dependency, so editing
# one re-runs the generator. The output is rewritten only when its content
# changes, so an unchanged configure does not touch the resource's mtime.
