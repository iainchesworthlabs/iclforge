# PkgConfig.cmake
#
# One .pc file per installed library component (see cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake, which calls
# iclforge_install_pkgconfig() once at the end of each component's own install block), for a
# non-CMake consumer - `pkg-config --cflags --libs iclforge-ac3`, or a Makefile/autotools/meson build
# that discovers dependencies that way rather than via find_package(). One .pc per component
# mirrors the one-export-set-per-component shape InstallLibrary.cmake already uses; there is no
# umbrella "iclforge.pc" pulling everything in, the same way there is no single combined CMake
# export set either.
#
# @ICLFORGE_PC_PREFIX@ deliberately does NOT resolve to a build-time-baked CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:
# this project's primary distribution shape is a relocatable ZIP/TGZ archive
# (docs/releasing.md's "What gets published"), unpacked by an end user to an arbitrary directory
# that has nothing to do with the machine this was configured on. A plain `prefix=/some/build/
# time/path` in the .pc file would be silently wrong for every such consumer. Instead this uses
# pkg-config's own `${pcfiledir}` builtin (supported by both pkg-config >= 0.27 and pkgconf,
# widely relied on for exactly this) plus a configure-time-computed relative path back from
# "<libdir>/pkgconfig" to the prefix root, so the prefix resolves correctly wherever the .pc file
# itself physically ends up - a real system install (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX honoured, same as
# iclforgeConfig.cmake.in's own @PACKAGE_INIT@ relocation) or an unpacked archive alike.

# What a link has to add for the C++ objects in a static archive when a C compiler drives it - a

# toolchain (libstdc++ or libc++, and the NDK and Apple differ again), so it is read from what
# CMake recorded for the compiler that built the archives, in CMAKE_CXX_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES.
# That list also holds what a C driver links anyway (c, gcc, gcc_s), which stays out. It is empty
# for MSVC, which has no pkg-config consumer.

# NAME: pkg-config name, e.g. `pkg-config --libs iclforge-ac3`: iclforge-<library>, the library's
# file name (iclforge_<library>, see e.g. src/ac3/CMakeLists.txt) with a hyphen, which is also
# the on-disk library basename whenever the shared variant is what's actually installed.
# LIBNAME: the `-l<LIBNAME>` this component's install actually provides - see
# iclforge_pkgconfig_libname() below for how callers derive this correctly for whichever
# linkage(s) got installed.
# REQUIRES: other .pc names this one's Requires: line should chain to (space-separated), for a
# genuine PUBLIC/usage-requirement dependency - e.g. iclforge-adm requires iclforge-iab because
# iclforge_adm_shared PUBLIC-links iclforge::iab, whose types the bridge's headers name.
# STATIC_REQUIRES: .pc names a static archive of this component calls into, for a dependency that
# is PRIVATE in CMake - iclforge_c, whose libiclforge_c_static.a holds calls into
# libiclforge_ac3_static.a. An archive is not linked when it is built, so nothing in it records that
# dependency, where a shared library records its own. It is written to Requires.private, which
# pkg-config follows for the link line only with --static, and only when LIBNAME is a static
# archive. A Requires: line would make every consumer of the shared libiclforge_c.so depend on
# libiclforge_ac3.so as well, although that library embeds the codec so that it is the one library to
# load (src/capi/CMakeLists.txt).
#
# A .pc that names a static archive (its LIBNAME ends in _static, the name that
# iclforge_pkgconfig_libname() below picks) also gets Libs.private with the C++ runtime and libm,
# unless it requires another package: that package carries them, and there they follow every
# archive on the link line, which they have to. A linker running with --as-needed, as GCC on
# Ubuntu does by default, drops a shared library that no earlier input needs, so an archive named
# after -lm finds no libm.
