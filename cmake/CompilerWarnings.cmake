# CompilerWarnings.cmake
#
# Defines an INTERFACE target `iclforge::warnings` that turns on a strict,
# cross-compiler warning set with "warnings as errors". Link it PRIVATE-ly
# into every first-party target (library, apps, tests). Third-party code (Qt,
# Catch2) is pulled in as SYSTEM headers by their package configs, so these
# flags never fire on dependency code.
#
# examples/capi_encode_decode.c (the C API example) is the one C,
# not C++, source in the whole tree, and it links this same target like every
# other first-party one - so the warning lists below are split into a common
# set (valid for both languages) and a C++-only set gated behind
# $<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>. Without that gate, GCC/Clang hard-error on a C
# compile ("command-line option '-Wnon-virtual-dtor' is valid for C++/ObjC++
# but not for C") rather than silently ignoring the C++-specific flags.

# assumption this comment used to make is wrong, found compiling for Android
# with NDK r26's bundled Clang 17.0.2 (see docs/platforms/android.md) - that
# Clang errors with "-Werror,-Wunknown-warning-option" on -Wno-c2y-extensions
# because -Wc2y-extensions itself did not exist yet (C2y diagnostics landed
# upstream well after 17), so THIS project's own -Werror turns the unknown
# flag into a hard failure rather than a silent no-op. So this DOES need a

# dereference" inside <streambuf>'s gptr()/egptr(), and apps/cli/main.cpp's
# load_sources() std::vector<std::size_t>::resize() flags one inside
# <bits/stl_construct.h> - both after GCC inlines several layers deep into

# inlining/vectorization decisions the optimizer made, and misattributes an
# "impossible" path those transformations introduced as a real null
# dereference in the original source) - see gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla, e.g. PR
# 108757 and neighbouring reports against std::vector/streambuf internals.
# Scoped to GCC < 15 specifically: the pinned CI compiler (both x64 and

# decoder.cpp and eac3_decoder.cpp's mantissa-reading `read_stream` lambda
# compute `s < nfchans && dithflag[s]`, where `dithflag` is a
# std::array<bool, 5> and `s` is sometimes called with the coupling stream's
# sentinel index (eac3_decoder.cpp's kCplStream, decoder.cpp's cpl_stream,
# both == kMaxSubstreamFullbw + 1 == 6) or the LFE's index (== nfchans) -
# values that are always >= nfchans, so `&&`'s short circuit means
# dithflag[s] is never actually evaluated for them. GCC 16 constant-folds
# the sentinel through the inlined call chain and flags the subscript
# expression itself ("array subscript 6 is above array bounds ... bool
# [5]") without accounting for the guard that prevents it ever executing -

# analysis misattributes an optimizer-introduced "impossible" path as a

# loses provenance across a chain of optimizer-introduced moves and flags a

# decode_substream's transient pre-noise hold-back path
# (libs/ac3/src/decoder/eac3_decoder.cpp,

# AC3_WARNINGS_OFF_FLAG - switches every warning off for one source file.
#
# The note above is true for third-party *headers*, but not for third-party
# code generators. Qt's moc, rcc, qmltyperegistrar and qmlcachegen emit C++
# into the build tree and add it to our own target, where it inherits
# iclforge::warnings - so a warning in a file nobody here wrote becomes a build
# failure under -Werror. It is not ours to fix, so it is not ours to warn
# about: see how apps/gui/CMakeLists.txt applies this to the generated sources.
#
# Not "/w" on real MSVC, deliberately. cl has very little to say about this
# generated code under /W4 to begin with (unlike clang-cl and GCC, which
# reject more of it - see apps/gui/CMakeLists.txt for the specific warning),
# so adding /w on top of the target's own /W4 would achieve nothing except a
# "D9025: overriding '/W4' with '/w'" on every generated file - a warning
# about the build, appearing on every build, to suppress warnings that were
# never going to fire.
#
# The one thing it DOES have to say: qmlcachegen falls back to interpreted
# (QJSValue-based) execution for a `var`-typed property whose function it
# cannot fully compile to native C++ - GuidedWizard.qml's data-driven step
# list is exactly that shape (a JS array of objects, filtered and searched
# by closures, not a fixed set of typed properties). The dispatch code Qt's
# own <QtQml/qjsprimitivevalue.h> generates for that path hits C4702
# (unreachable code) under cl's optimizer in Qt 6.8, on this MSVC toolset -
# real code Qt shipped, not a defect introduced here, so /wd4702 is scoped
# to only that one diagnostic rather than silencing the rest of /W4 the way
# non-MSVC's "-w" does. If a later Qt/cl combination stops emitting it, the
# flag becomes a harmless no-op rather than something that needs removing.
