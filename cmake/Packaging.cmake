# CPack packaging. Included once, from the top-level CMakeLists.txt, after
# every target's install() rules have been declared.
#
# A plain ZIP archive is always offered (needs no external tool). Platform-
# native formats are layered on top when the packaging tool for that format is
# actually available, so `cpack` degrades gracefully instead of failing
# outright. Which targets end up in a package is decided entirely by which
# install() rules ran - forge's runs unconditionally (ICLFORGE_BUILD_CLI
# defaults ON), forge-gui's only when ICLFORGE_BUILD_GUI is ON - so no extra
# gating is needed here for that.
#
# CMakePresets.json's packagePresets deliberately carry no "generators"
# field: `cpack --preset` passes that field to cpack as -G on the command
# line, which OVERRIDES the CPACK_GENERATOR list computed below - confirmed
# empirically, a preset naming NSIS made cpack hard-fail with "Cannot find
# NSIS compiler makensis" even with the find_program() gate below correctly
# leaving NSIS out of CPACK_GENERATOR because makensis was not on PATH.
# Omitting it lets CPack fall back to CPACK_GENERATOR from here instead, so
# the graceful degradation this file computes actually takes effect through
# `cpack --preset` and not only through a bare `cpack` invocation.

        # cannot be created here and then left behind on uninstall, which is
        # the failure mode of writing the CreateShortCut by hand. It resolves

        # application and should not disagree, and choosing a new published

        # installer entirely - cmake/CPackProjectConfig.cmake says why). A
        # .lnk straight to forge.exe would open a console, print the usage
        # text and close it again before anyone could read a line of it, so
        # the console tool gets the entry it can actually use instead: a
        # command prompt that already has $INSTDIR\bin on PATH. That has no
        # CPack variable of its own, hence raw NSIS through
        # CPACK_NSIS_CREATE_ICONS_EXTRA - which is injected inside the block
        # where $STARTMENU_FOLDER is in scope, unlike
        # CPACK_NSIS_EXTRA_INSTALL_COMMANDS below - and its uninstall half in
        # CPACK_NSIS_DELETE_ICONS_EXTRA, which runs in the uninstaller where
        # the same folder is $MUI_TEMP instead. The two name the same .lnk and
        # are one change; editing either alone leaves a shortcut behind.
        #
        # SetOutPath is there because NSIS gives a .lnk the CURRENT output
        # path as its working directory: without the first line the prompt
        # would open in $INSTDIR rather than beside the binaries. The second
        # puts it back for the shortcut CPack writes immediately after this
        # hook - CMake's own NSIS.template.in orders the core section
        # @CPACK_NSIS_CREATE_ICONS@, this, then `CreateShortCut ...
        # Uninstall.lnk` - so the uninstaller entry keeps the $INSTDIR working
        # directory every other CPack installer gives it. Nothing else in that
        # section is affected either way: @CPACK_NSIS_FULL_INSTALL@ lays the
        # files down at the top of it, long before this runs. Bracket

        #
        #   dpkg-shlibdeps reads a binary's DT_NEEDED entries and asks dpkg
        #   which *installed apt package* owns each .so. It resolves the Qt
        #   LIBRARIES that way when the kit is the distribution's own (the
        #   CI legs install qt6-base-dev/qt6-declarative-dev, so it does),
        #   and silently drops anything it cannot map - which is what
        #   happens with a private prebuilt kit from aqtinstall or a
        #   relocated archive. CountdownSolver hit that case in its own
        #   packaging (the comment in R:\CountdownSolver\cmake\Packaging.cmake)
        #   and works around it exactly this way.
        #
        #   A QML import is invisible to shlibdeps in EVERY case, distro kit
        #   or not. `import QtQuick.Controls` is resolved at run time by the
        #   QML engine walking its import paths for a qmldir and a plugin;
        #   none of that reaches the executable's ELF headers, so no
        #   library-level scan can ever see it. Debian and Ubuntu split
        #   those modules into one qml6-module-* package each, so a .deb
        #   without them installs cleanly and then dies at the first import
        #   - which is what the released .deb has been doing.

        #     rpmbuild is.

# Library component(s): a second, separate download alongside the existing
# forge/forge-gui package - headers + .lib/.dll/.a/.so + CMake package config
# for a third party consuming iclforge::ac3/iclforge::containers via
# find_package(iclforge) (see cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake). Everything
# install()'d without an explicit COMPONENT falls into CPack's own
# "Unspecified" component, which is why forge/forge-gui and every
# InstallLibrary.cmake rule now carry one explicitly.
#
# Three components, not two: "runtime" (forge/forge-gui, unchanged), "library"
# (headers, static archives, CMake package config, and - on Unix - the
# unversioned .so namelink symlink you link against), and "libruntime" (just
# the versioned .so/.dylib a linked binary loads at runtime - see
# cmake/InstallLibrary.cmake's NAMELINK_COMPONENT comment for why that file
# alone is split out). library+libruntime are DELIBERATELY kept as one
# archive download below (a "-dev" ZIP/TGZ downloader wants both without
# knowing this split exists) but as three separate DEB/RPM packages
# (cmake/CPackProjectConfig.cmake overrides the grouping back to IGNORE for
# just those two generators) - that split is the entire point of shipping
# them as .deb/.rpm at all: apt/dnf can then pull in "the .so a linked binary
# needs" via libiclforge0 without the headers/static archives libiclforge-dev
# carries, the same libFOO/libFOO-dev shape every other Linux C library uses.
#
# CPACK_ARCHIVE_COMPONENT_INSTALL is specifically the Archive generator
# family's (ZIP/TGZ) own component-install switch - it does not affect
# NSIS/DragNDrop, each of which has its own separate
# CPACK_<GENERATOR>_COMPONENT_INSTALL flag, left off here deliberately:
#   - NSIS: a component installer can't also produce a second standalone
#     download the way a second archive naturally can - splitting it would
#     need an entirely different NSIS packaging shape, not a flag flip.
#   - DragNDrop: no macOS host to build or verify this against at all (see
#     the DragNDrop branch above); cmake/CPackProjectConfig.cmake already
#     forces it monolithic regardless of the component/grouping state here.
# DEB/RPM get their own *_COMPONENT_INSTALL switch, set inside their own
# find_program() blocks above, now that the split is real work rather than
# a placeholder.
# The `runtime` component is forge/forge-gui plus the
# generated forge.1 man page and the bash/zsh/fish/PowerShell completion
# scripts - all install()'d with COMPONENT runtime from
# apps/forge/cli/CMakeLists.txt, so every generator below picks them up with the
# binary rather than needing a component of their own. They are absent only
# from a package built where the host cannot run the target's binary - they are
# produced by running the freshly built forge - which is a host/target
# comparison, not CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING (see that file's own guard for why the
# difference matters: testing the flag instead left them out of every Linux and
# macOS package for as long as it stood).
