// What a Sendspin player keeps across a reboot, in NVS: its X25519 identity,
// its pairing PSK, its pairing records, the names of the servers they are with,
// and the last-playback server (pairing.md, Pairing Records; connection.md,
// Multiple servers). It is the board's form of the test sink's state directory
// (apps/hearth/testsink/src/store.hpp), and like that one it is also the player's
// key ring.
//
// The identity and the pairing PSK come from the hardware RNG on a board's
// first boot and stay until forget(). A board's client_id is its identity's
// public key, and every server's pairing record names it, so a reflash that
// keeps the NVS partition keeps the board's pairings.
//
// The records are held in RAM once loaded, in a fixed-size array, least
// recently used first (pairing_records.hpp): a handshake looks a PSK up without
// touching flash or the heap. The servers' names are not: they are read from
// NVS when someone asks for the list, and written when a server pairs or comes
// back under a name the board does not have. A write goes to NVS at once, from
// whichever task made it, which must be one whose stack is in internal RAM -
// NVS runs with the flash cache off.
//
// NVS is not encrypted unless the project turns on NVS encryption, so anyone
// holding the board can read these keys. docs/threat-model.md says what that
// exposes.
//
// Thread-safe: a handshake on the Sendspin server's task looks a PSK up while
// the control surface's task lists the records.
