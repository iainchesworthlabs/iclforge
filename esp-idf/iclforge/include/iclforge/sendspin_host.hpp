// A Sendspin player on a board: the WebSocket a server connects to, a
// PlayerSession for each connection, admission between servers, pairing and
// the records it leaves (planning/hearth-reference-player.md, B3;
// planning/hearth-sendspin-extension.md). libs/sendspin's player half does the
// protocol; this is what a board adds around it, and what the test sink's
// Sink class (apps/hearth/testsink/src/sink.cpp) is on a computer.
//
// ONE TASK RUNS EVERY SESSION. The host is an esp_http_server instance of its
// own, on the Sendspin port, and that server's task receives each WebSocket
// frame and hands it to its connection's session; the session's answer goes
// back on the same socket before the next frame is read. The sessions' timers
// run on that task too (httpd_queue_work from an esp_timer), and so does
// anything the owner asks of a session from another task. PlayerSession wants
// one caller at a time, and this task is that caller, so no lock is taken
// around a session. The Noise handshake's X25519 and SHA-256 run there, which
// is what SendspinHostConfig::stack_bytes is sized for.
//
// A server of its own rather than a route on the control surface's server
// (control.hpp): the page and the REST routes stay on port 80, where the page
// has always been, and a slow page request never holds up a burst.
//
// THE OWNER'S EVENTS (SendspinEvents) arrive on that task, inside the
// session's call: an implementation copies what it needs and returns. The
// methods below that say they are safe from any task queue their work onto the
// server's task.
