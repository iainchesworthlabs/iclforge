## How to read this

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **In progress** | Active development on `main`, or on a named branch named below |
| **Partial** | Some of the scope is shipped; the row splits what is done from what is not |
| **Proposed** | Strong candidate or agreed direction; not started, or study only |
| **Blocked** | Wanted but waiting on an external dependency |
| **Out of scope** | Deliberately not doing (with reason) |

Sizes, where they still matter, are rough: **S** (an afternoon), **M** (a day or two), **L** (a
focused week), **XL** (several PRs).

## In progress

### Hearth

Hearth has no legacy roadmap IDs. Status is reconciled from
[`planning/hearth-reference-player.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/hearth-reference-player.md)
and [`docs/hearth/index.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/hearth/index.md).

| Feature | Done | Not done | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| Desktop player | Queue, transport, gapless, passthrough, meters, settings, diagnostics (saved, copied, a live view in Settings, a native debug channel on Windows and an opt-in loopback HTTP endpoint) (`apps/hearth/engine/`; `[hearth]` tests); the Qt window (Play, Media, Speakers, Decoder, Network and Settings pages); AC-4 playback, channel-based, immersive and object; packages for Windows, macOS and Linux | A user guide for the app; screenshots of the running app (the Hearth images in the repository are design mockups); Pro Logic II from the Decoder page; a decoder-delay trim between two AC-4 items in a queue (a gap of about 27 ms) | [Hearth index](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/hearth/index.md) |
| Desktop player | Queue, transport, gapless, passthrough, meters, settings, diagnostics (`apps/hearth/engine/`; `[hearth]` tests); the Qt window (Play, Media, Speakers, Decoder, Network and Settings pages); AC-4 playback of channel-based, immersive and object streams (A-JOC and direct-coded); packages for Windows, macOS and Linux | A user guide for the app; screenshots of the running app (the Hearth images in the repository are design mockups); playing from MP4, Matroska and MPEG-TS files (the player reads raw `.ac3`, `.ec3` and `.ac4` streams); listing AC-4 objects on the Play page; sending AC-4 to an ESP32 sink | [Hearth index](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/hearth/index.md) |
| Network output | Sendspin discovery, pairing, groups and playing to a group from the app; updating a sink's firmware from the app; aiosendspin CI exit | Music Assistant tested against a real instance | [Sendspin extension plan](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/hearth-sendspin-extension.md) |
| ESP32 sinks | `hearth_sink` on the ESP32-S3, the ESP32-C6 (stereo) and the ESP32-P4 (revision 1.x): Improv, groups, updates over the network, QEMU CI (S3); firmware images for each, published from the next release | TDM DAC hardware exits (ES9080 pair); the wide P4 sink; AC-4 decoded by a sink in a Sendspin group, AC-4 on the C6 and AC-4 timed on an S3 board (see the AC-4 section) | [ESP32-S3 sink guide](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/hearth/sink-esp32-s3.md), [Sink firmware](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/hearth/sink-firmware.md) |
| ESP32 sinks | `hearth_sink` on the ESP32-S3, the ESP32-C6 (stereo) and the ESP32-P4 (revision 1.x): Improv, groups, updates over the network, QEMU CI; firmware images for each, published from the next release | TDM DAC hardware exits (ES9080 pair); TDM on the P4 (this board's chip revision cannot open it); AC-4 in a Sendspin group on any ESP32 part (phase I6, see the AC-4 section) | [ESP32-S3 sink guide](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/hearth/sink-esp32-s3.md), [Sink firmware](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/hearth/sink-firmware.md) |

**Sink module tiers (shared PCB → pair of ES9080s):** **OK** C6 (2.0, shipped, one DAC) ·
**good** C61 (5.1 desired, proposed, no board) · **better** S3 (7.1.4 without enhanced coupling,
both DACs @ 16-bit) · **best** P4 (9.1.6 + full tools desired, both DACs @ 32-bit on one I2S).
Study:
[`planning/esp32-sink-tiers.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/esp32-sink-tiers.md).

**Not built:** the C61 tier (no board, no probe, no sink shape); TDM on the P4, which this board's revision v1.3
chip cannot open above two channels; the ES9080 pair and its PCB.

**Done:** ESP32-P4 probe and board timing table, no network (tier study P1) — real time on every
fixture at this board's 360 MHz — and `hearth_sink` on the P4 over the onboard C6 (P3, 2026-09-23).
[`docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-p4.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-p4.md).

### Library — AC-4 decode and encode (Partial)

The decoder, the encoder, the IEC 61937 carriage and the applications are built. The ESP32 parts
other than the P4, the ESP32 sinks and the names are not. What ships is in
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) and
[AC-4 in the library](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/library/ac4.md);
this table keeps what is unfinished.

| Layer | State |
|---|---|
| Inspector, decoder and encoder (`libs/ac4`) | **Shipped** (phases D1 to D10 and E1 to E10 of `planning/ac4.md`). Decode to PCM: mono, stereo, 3.0, 5.X and 7.X in every codec mode Part 1 gives them (SIMPLE, ASPX and the A-CPL modes), the immersive element of 7.0.4 and 7.1.4 in full and core decoding, the 22.2 element in full decoding as coded (24 channels, checked on constructed streams alone), A-JOC and direct-coded objects with their metadata, streams of several presentations, every frame rate (the efficient high frame rate mode included), the speech spectral frontend, the output level, DRC, dialogue enhancement, the downmix and concealment. Encode: mono, stereo, 5.0 and 5.1 in the SIMPLE, ASPX and A-CPL modes, 5.0.4 and 5.1.4 in the immersive element, several substreams and the presentations of Part 2 Table 53, every frame rate, constant, average and variable rates, I-frames and the metadata, and, behind `experimental.objects`, A-JOC and direct-coded objects. The three libraries are installed and exported ([AC-4 in the library](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/library/ac4.md), [encoding a stream](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/library/ac4.md#encoding-a-stream), [encoding objects](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/library/ac4.md#encoding-objects)) |
| What they refuse, and what is experimental | The decoder refuses, by name, core decoding of 22.2 and its rendering to any layout but as coded (Part 2 gives it neither), and, at 96 or 192 kHz, everything but the SIMPLE codec mode (A-SPX and A-CPL, the speech spectral frontend, the immersive and 22.2 elements, objects, the mixing of a presentation's substreams, dialogue enhancement and DRC's compression curve; the output level and the downmix apply). The speech spectral frontend, the efficient high frame rate mode, the 9.X.4 modes and the SIMPLE mode at 96 and 192 kHz are decoded from the text alone, no stream using any of them. The encoder writes as experimental options what DEE's streams do not contain and no reader outside the project has read from it: 7.0 and 7.1 in the 7.X element, 3.0, the 5.X element's other coding configurations, ASPX_ACPL_1 and A-CPL in stereo, balance coding, VARVAR framing and frequency interleaving in A-SPX, 7.0.4 and 7.1.4 with the back pair, A-JCC, and objects |
| IEC 61937 carriage (`iclforge::containers::iec61937`, `PassthroughSink`, Hearth's extension role) | **Built** (phase D11) — the four IEC 61937-14 burst types at every frame rate, read back unchanged; passthrough on ALSA and Android, the platforms whose APIs can send AC-4; the extension role's AC-4 data type, decoded by the test sink; no receiver found accepts AC-4 |
| Applications (`forge`, Hearth, Forge GUI, bindings) | **Shipped** (phases I1 to I5b). `forge` reads and writes AC-4 in `decode`, `ac4-encode`, `transcode`, `record`, `live`, `monitor`, `play`, `qc`, `levels`, `loudness`, `spdif`, `probe`, `mp4`, `ts`, `fmp4`, `atmos-encode`, `atmos-adm` and `atmos-iab`; `mkv` refuses it, since Matroska registers no codec ID. Hearth's desktop player plays channel-based, immersive and object AC-4, decoded for every output and sent as bursts to network sinks that list it, with the Decoder page's AC-4 controls and the Media page's AC-4 information. The Forge GUI encodes AC-4 from a file (mono to 5.1, or objects, to a raw stream or an MP4 file), and its QC, player, Open stream and object pages read it. The C API and the Python, Rust and WebAssembly bindings decode and encode it, objects included. Android's CMake wrapper builds the AC-4 library; the Shield app does not link it. **Not done:** an AC-4 live session in the GUI; Pro Logic II from Hearth's Decoder page; a WebAssembly demo page for the AC-4 module; the encoder's substreams, presentations, loudness, DRC, downmix and dialogue groups in the bindings; a gap of about 27 ms between two AC-4 items in a Hearth queue, since the decoder's delay is not trimmed at an item's start |
| ESP32 (`float` on the P4, then the S3; fixed point on the C6) | **In progress** — plan phase D14: the decoder on `double`, `float` and fixed point by target, as AC-3 and E-AC-3 are, the P4 first. **Built:** D14a: AC-4 in `ICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR`, so `forge` and the whole test suite build and pass with a `float` decoder on the host; the QMF banks as one 64-point transform on split planes with vector kernels, `SubstreamPcm` down from 299 KB to 10.9 KB, a cached bit reader and table-driven Huffman decoding; and the Cortex-M3 probe's AC-4 rows (`run_baremetal_probe.sh --ac4`: five streams in an image of 486 KB, 0.43 to 1.93 MB of heap and 54.5 M to 205.8 M instructions a frame, the PCM bit-identical to the host's; `float` agrees with `double` to 109 dB or better below A-SPX's crossover and 37 dB or better above it). D14b: the component builds the decoder in `float` behind `CONFIG_ICLFORGE_AC4`, and `hearth_sink` plays AC-4 on the P4 at 360 MHz with Wi-Fi up: 2.0 in SIMPLE mode decodes in real time (0.28 of a frame), in A-SPX mode at 0.37 and, through the frame-rate converter at 24, 25, 23.976 and 29.97 fps, at 0.51, 0.53, 0.68 and 0.69; 5.1 decodes in real time in SIMPLE mode (0.64), in A-SPX mode (0.83) and in A-SPX mode with A-CPL mode 2 (0.91), A-CPL mode 3 takes 1.14 and 5.1.4 1.57 to 1.90, against E-AC-3's 0.18 for 5.1 and 0.37 for 7.1.4 on the same image. The board's PCM equals the host's, the Cortex-M3 leg's and the probe's six pinned fixtures on the twenty plays and the six core plays: D14a4 took `std::pow`, `std::exp2` and `hypotf` at `float`, whose last bit differs between C libraries, out of libm, and runs the converter in `float` (28 to 29 times faster, 7.3 ms a frame at 24 and 25 fps); D14a5 builds the converter's `float` tables at compile time (the 1001/960 first frame from 5.9 s to 0.3 s, and 16.5 ms a frame at 23.976 fps from 22.4); D14a6 takes the P4's 32 KB of low-power SRAM, which the heap had been handing out at 174 cycles a load, out of the heap (the 29.97 fps converter from 93.8 ms a frame to 12.0, and 3 to 24% off every other play's time); D14e brings 5.1 under its duration (the transforms, A-CPL and the output in fewer passes, `-O3` for the kernels and the flash read in QIO mode took a 5.1 frame from 1.17, 1.52, 1.94 and 3.86 times its duration in SIMPLE mode, A-SPX, A-SPX with A-CPL mode 2 and A-CPL mode 3 to 0.64, 0.83, 0.91 and 1.14, with no `float` hash moved). What holds the time now is A-CPL mode 3, whose interpolation needs the compiler's soft-float `double`, and the QMF banks ([ESP32-P4](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-p4.md#ac-4)). D14c builds the decoder for the S3 with its state in PSRAM, which QEMU emulates: the six probe fixtures decode in CI with the PCM equal to the pins and 3 to 14 KB of internal RAM in use, where ESP-IDF's default placement filled internal RAM at 5.1 (measured before D14f; [ESP32-S3](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md#ac-4)); its board phase, time and Wi-Fi, has not run. D14d builds the decoder's fixed-point tier (`ICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR=fixed`) and offers `CONFIG_ICLFORGE_AC4` on the ESP32-C6 and ESP32-C3; its PCM is one hash on the host, the Cortex-M3 leg and RV32IMC, and D14f takes a 2.0 decode to 286,365 bytes at either tier, which does not fit a C6 beside Wi-Fi, so a C6 sink takes AC-4 programmes from Hearth as PCM; the C6's board run has not been made. **Not built:** I6: `hearth_sink` decoding AC-4 in a Sendspin group on the ESP32 parts |

Plan: [`planning/ac4.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/ac4.md).
Its first phase (G0) made the DEE reference streams the others need, and G1 made the golden masters
for the phases after it; the local DEE licence ends on 2026-11-06 and will not be renewed, so a
stream DEE has not been asked for cannot be made after that date.

### Library — API freeze → v1.0.0 (was AP1, L)

**Done:** tiering and SemVer policy in
[`docs/library/api-stability.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/library/api-stability.md);
C version macros; release criteria written.

**Not done (deferred to the v1.0.0 cut):** flip `SOVERSION` to the major component; introduce
`inline namespace v1`; make the ABI gate **required** (today advisory — see `_ci-core.yml`
`ABI_ENFORCE`).

### Library — TrueHD experimental module (was IM5, L)

Substantial internal codec on branch `feature/truehd-atmos-support` — not on `main`. To merge:
rebase, gate as `iclforge::mlp` / `ICLFORGE_BUILD_MLP`, remove non-redistributable PDFs, label output
accurately (no real TrueHD decoder reads the current block layout). Forge front ends follow as a
separate item (was UX10). Dolby Encoding Engine's TrueHD streams of known sources (2, 6 and 8
channels, 48 and 96 kHz, 16 and 24 bits, several presentations), made by
`tools/generators/gen_dee_gold.py` while DEE's licence runs (it ends on 2026-11-06), are kept
locally for what the clean-room rule below allows.

**Authenticity note (for that branch):** TrueHD carries a separate keyed check from DD+ EMDF
object signing — **Evolution frame protection**, a truncated HMAC-SHA-256 over the access unit
and the Evolution frame. Open decoders (e.g. truehdd `--evo-key`) optionally verify it with an
operator-supplied key; without a key they decode unchecked. When authenticity policy lands for
MLP (multi-key verify / unchecked / licensed soft-gate), wire it to Evolution HMAC, not to
`iclforge::ac3::signing`'s EMDF path. See [Object signing](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/concepts/object-signing.md#sibling-truehd-evolution).

### Crucible — cross-platform product (was UX12, Partial)

**Done:** rename to Crucible; Windows and Linux verified on real hardware (Pi PipeWire pass,
receiver display read); Linux packages; macOS platform half **compiles and runs headless suites
in CI**.

**Not done:** launch Crucible interactively on a Mac with audio; macOS package; native-speaker
translation review (CR1); attestation-signed Windows driver (see DR6).

Detail: [`docs/crucible/design/promotion.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/crucible/design/promotion.md).
Current product status:
[`docs/crucible/index.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/crucible/index.md).

### Shared audio — macOS process tap (was UX7, Partial)

Code is in `libs/audio/src/backend/macos/process_tap.mm` and compiles on macOS CI legs. The path
is **refused by default** because `AudioDeviceCreateIOProcID` hung the HAL client in Crucible's
first real run; opt-in via `ICLFORGE_MACOS_PROCESS_TAP`. No Mac has captured audio through a tap
yet.

### Shared — hardware verification (was DR9, Partial)

| Backend | State |
|---|---|
| Linux / ALSA passthrough | **Confirmed** on Raspberry Pi → AVR |
| Linux / PipeWire | **Confirmed** on Pi; Crucible live path verified |
| Windows / WASAPI exclusive | **Confirmed** on Onkyo TX-RZ740 |
| macOS / CoreAudio tap and desktop apps | **Not verified** on real Mac hardware |
| Pi 5; second Android TV | **Outstanding** |

## Partial tails on shipped work

These shipped but have an open follow-on. They do not belong in "In progress" as whole features.

| Topic | Shipped | Follow-on |
|---|---|---|
| **IAMF** (was IM3) | `libs/containers/src/iamf`: v2.0 reader and writer — channel-based and object-based `ipcm` elements, scalable channel reconstruction, Opus / AAC-LC / FLAC packets carried, Parameter Blocks, trimming, raw OBU streams, ISO-BMFF and fragments | Nothing planned. Known and accepted: encoding and decoding Opus, AAC-LC and FLAC (the module links no codec; packets are carried), Common Encryption (needs AES, and the module has no third-party dependency), rendering to a playback layout and mixing (section 7.4 leaves the algorithms to the Open Audio Renderer) |
| **IAB** (was IM1) | Reader, `AudioDataDLC` decode, writer and DLC encoder, spread and zone control into the Atmos bridge, ST 2067-201 MXF Track File write | A Track File checked by an IMF packager or validator |
| **Object authenticity modes** | `iclforge::ac3::signing` HMAC tag; `sign-objects`; single-key `verify-objects` (hard fail); default decode reconstructs objects **unchecked** (FOSS-style) | **Multi-key** verify (keyring / repeated `signing-key=`); **licensed** soft-gate (e.g. `gate-objects`: tag mismatch / unsigned → bed-only, decode continues); CLI + docs naming the three modes — [Object signing](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/concepts/object-signing.md#planned-decode-modes). TrueHD Evolution HMAC is the parallel on IM5, not EMDF |
| **Multi-programme E-AC-3 encode** | `programme2=`..`programme8=` authoring via CLI (all eight §E2.3.1.2 substreams, full per-programme `mixmdate`/`bsmod` metadata) | Receiver-side use of that metadata — actually combining an associated service with the main programme during mixdown, rather than just carrying it — see [capabilities](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/library/capabilities.md) |
| **Encoder reproducibility** (was VX12) | Audit done; `ilogb` fix landed | Re-validate FP-gated bit-cost thresholds; fixed-point transient port optional |
| **Listening test** (was VX9) | Apparatus in `tools/listening/` | **No session run yet** — see [`tools/listening/responses/README.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/tools/listening/responses/README.md) |
| **Crucible translations** (was CR1) | Six catalogues complete (385 messages each) | Native-speaker reading of mechanical translations |

## Proposed

| Item | Notes | Was |
|---|---|---|
| Generated API reference and versioned docs | Doxygen into mkdocs; `latest` / `dev` branches | AP8 |
| GStreamer element or FFmpeg external encoder for >5.1 / JOC encode | Out of tree, over the C API; AP5 (C API) is done | AP10 |
| Dolby Reference Player wider CI crosscheck | Extend beyond `none/cpl/spx/aht/all`; self-hosted Windows job | VX5 |
| Perceptual encoder criterion calibration | EQ13 follow-on; `kPerceptual` | EQ14 |
| Object authenticity: multi-key + licensed gate | Completes the Partial tail above — keyring verify and AVR-like bed-only soft-gate for EMDF; Evolution HMAC for TrueHD rides IM5 | — |
| QC delivery report file | `forge qc` writes stdout today | [`planning/qc-report.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/qc-report.md) |
| DAW / NLE host plugin | Feasibility study only | [`planning/host-plugin.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/host-plugin.md) |
| ESP32 sink tiers (C6 / C61 / S3 / P4) on one ES9080 PCB | Modular MCU: C6 2.0 / one DAC (shipped); C61 5.1 desired (no board); S3 ≤7.1.4 no ecpl / both DACs @ 16-bit (shipped); P4 ≤9.1.6 full tools desired / both DACs @ 32-bit on one I2S. P4 reopened only as best tier; its probe and hosted-Wi-Fi sink are built, its TDM output and the PCB are not | [`planning/esp32-sink-tiers.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/esp32-sink-tiers.md) |
| vcpkg git registry | Consumers install via `vcpkg install iclforge` | DR3 |
| winget and ConanCenter | Manifests staged; CLA and submission pending | DR4 |
| AC-4 in the performance and quality reporting | **Partial** — stereo and 5.1 encode/decode in `iclforge-perf`, `iclforge-bench` and `iclforge-membench`; AC-4 kernels in `iclforge-kernelbench`; decode quality in `ac4-quality-main.jsonl` with a chart on [Quality trend](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/quality-trend.md#ac-4-decode-quality). Still open: encode quality trend and tool-comparison series. The merge queue compares speed and memory for a change to `src/`, AC-4's rows included (#1132). **M** | [Performance and quality](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/performance-quality.md) |
| Hearth desktop app: user guide and screenshots | The app has an index page and sink guides, and no guide of its own; the Hearth images in the repository are design mockups. `hearth --shot <png> --page <name>` captures each page, but it starts network discovery, which on Windows asks to register a firewall rule, so a capture run has to expect that prompt. **M** | [Hearth index](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/hearth/index.md) |
| Forge GUI screenshots of live capture | Three of the 17 screenshots (`format-vbr`, `live-session-idle`, `live-session-vbr-note`) predate the header's Inspect objects, Open stream and About buttons; taking them again needs an open capture device. **S** | [Live capture](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/forge/gui/live-session.md) |
| Names and layout (phase N1 of `planning/ac4.md`) | The tree has the new names. The programs are `forge`, `forge-gui`, `hearth` and `crucible` (N1A, #1164), the libraries are 22 under `src/` with the targets `iclforge::<library>` and the headers `iclforge/<library>/` (N1B S2 to S4, #1160 to #1162), the pages, addresses and package metadata follow (S5), and the AC-3 codec's C++ names are in `iclforge::ac3`, a peer of `iclforge::ac4` (S6). The Windows driver is `IclForgeNullSink` and its endpoint "Speakers (Crucible Silent Output)" (N1D). [Renamed](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/renamed.md) lists every old name beside its new one. **Not done:** the owner renames the repository, the Homebrew tap and the SonarCloud project key and publishes the first release under the new names; `iclforge` is a new PyPI project and the old one stays as it is, and the Homebrew formula and cask are renamed (decisions 40 and 41); U1 revises wording that is not a name. **L** | [`planning/ac4.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/ac4.md#n1-the-names), [`planning/layout.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/layout.md) |
| AC-4 in the CLI's man page | The banner and exit-code text name AC-4; the man page still needs the same pass. **S** | [Commands](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/forge/cli/commands.md) |

## Blocked

| Item | Blocker | Was |
|---|---|---|
| TrueHD interoperability with shipping decoders | Non-public MLP reference material; clean-room policy (IM6) | IM6 |
| macOS notarisation and Windows Authenticode | Certificates and accounts, not code (Known gap since 0.8.0-beta.2) | DR6 |

---

## Out of scope

- **Forging Dolby's authenticity tag** — see [`docs/concepts/object-signing.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/concepts/object-signing.md). The signer ships; the key is the operator's. Multi-key verify and licensed soft-gate (Partial / Proposed above) use **operator-provisioned** keys only — they do not recover or invent decoder secrets.
- **AC-3 VBR** — structurally impossible; frame size indexes a fixed table.
- **Room correction and equalisation** — covered by [Cavern](https://github.com/VoidXH/Cavern). Hearth renders to the speakers and manages them (per-output trim and delay, a bass-management crossover) and does no measurement, equalisation or filtering beyond the crossover. A headphone/binaural preview for the WASM demo stays off unless that boundary is redrawn on purpose.
- **A DAMF reader** — no public specification; IM1 / ADM BWF is the replacement.
- **TrueHD interoperability by black-box analysis of Dolby streams** — not until the clean-room rule explicitly allows it.
- **An external oracle for `fscod2` audio** — FFmpeg and Dolby Reference Player refuse it.
- **Perfect separation of co-directional objects** — property of parametric object coding.
- **Enabling PipeWire `iec958Codecs` on the user's behalf** — session-manager policy; documented instead.
- **HOA, Matrix and Binaural ADM pack types in the Atmos bridge** — refused with `kUnsupportedType`: `AtmosEncoder` takes positioned mono objects, and none of the three is one. The parser still reads HOA and Binaural blocks; libadm has no model for a Matrix block's coefficients.
- **AC-4 in Matroska** — Matroska registers no codec ID for AC-4, so `forge mkv` refuses it; MP4, CMAF and MPEG-TS carry it.
- **AC-4 beyond the plan's scope** — transcoding between AC-4 and AC-3 or E-AC-3 without decoding (`forge transcode` goes through PCM); rendering objects inside the decoder, headphone virtualisation and head tracking; presentations spread over several elementary streams and the efficient high frame rate mode; protected (encrypted) tracks; MPEG-TS under ATSC A/342-2's profile (DVB's is carried); the speech spectral frontend in the encoder; writing immersive stereo (`presentation_version` 2); the encoder on any ESP32; and AC-4 in Crucible, which captures applications into Atmos objects for receivers when no receiver accepts AC-4. The decoder's speech frontend, 9.X.4 modes and 96 and 192 kHz decoding wait for a stream that uses them. See [Deliberately not in scope](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/ac4.md#deliberately-not-in-scope).
- **APT/DNF repositories and Docker images** — not planned; see [`docs/releasing.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/releasing.md).
- **ESP32-P4 as a replacement for the S3 Wi-Fi Sendspin sink** — closed 2026-09-08 (no on-die radio; no float PIE win; S3 probe already real-time). **Complementary P4 “best” module** (Ethernet / hosted C6, dual ES9080 @ 32-bit) is partly built: the probe and the hosted-Wi-Fi sink exist, TDM and the ES9080 pair do not — see [`planning/esp32-sink-tiers.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/planning/esp32-sink-tiers.md) and [`esp32-c3.md`](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge/blob/main/docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-c3.md#why-not-the-esp32-p4).
- **Per-channel and per-block SNR offsets** — tried and declined (EQ2); reference encoders agree with shipped behaviour.
- **Multi-service (multi-PID) MPEG-TS authoring** — one PMT with a main-service PID plus associated-service PIDs, built in one invocation. `iclforge::containers::mpegts::mux` stays a single-elementary-stream muxer (its own header comment calls a general multiplexer out of scope); `mainid`/`asvc` describe links an operator authors across separately-muxed files, not a multiplex this tool builds for them.

## Legacy ID index

Old IDs (`EQ1`, `UX12`, `A1`–`G4`, planning chips) are **retired for new work**. They remain here
so old PRs and comments still resolve. Do not allocate new IDs.
