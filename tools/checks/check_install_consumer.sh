# Installed-package consumer check for iclforge's C API and its AC-4 decoder and encoder.
#
# libs/capi/tests and the C examples compile against the build tree, where the generated headers sit
# under <build>/libs/capi/generated whether or not an install rule copies them. That is how
# `cmake --install` shipped an iclforge_c/iclforge.h nobody could include: it #includes
# iclforge_c/version.h, which is generated, and only the source include/ directory and export.h
# were installed. This is the check that was missing. For each build directory given it installs
# the tree, then configures, builds and runs a C program (tools/checks/install_consumer) against
# the installed prefix with find_package(iclforge), the way a downstream project would.
#
# The build tree hides a second thing. Every executable in it links {fmt}, so an installed static
# archive whose objects call a {fmt} function they do not define still links there, while a
# consumer of the installed archive stopped at `undefined reference to fmt::v12::vprint`. One
# consumer also pulls only the archive members its own calls reach: the C program never reaches
# mp4's HLS and DASH writers, which call {fmt} as well. So before that program is built, every
# installed static archive is linked whole into one executable by the C++ driver of the compiler
# that built the tree. The C++ runtime and libm are the driver's to supply, and whatever the
# linker still reports as undefined is a symbol the package uses and does not provide.
# --whole-archive is the GNU and lld spelling, so this runs where the CI leg that calls it does,
# on Linux.
#
# It installs the `library` and `libruntime` components, the two that make up the iclforge-dev-*
# packages (cmake/Packaging.cmake), so the CLI and GUI stay out and a tree that is already built
# takes seconds. Each build directory is one ICLFORGE_INSTALL_BOTH_LINKAGES/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
# combination and needs ICLFORGE_BUILD_CAPI=ON; pass several to check several. Every exported C
# API target is linked and run, static and shared; install_consumer/CMakeLists.txt says how. So is
# every exported AC-4 decoder target, in a C++ program that decodes a committed stream
# (install_consumer/consumer_ac4.cpp), and every exported AC-4 encoder target, in one that encodes
# a tone and reads it back with the inspector (install_consumer/consumer_ac4_encoder.cpp); a tree built
# with ICLFORGE_BUILD_AC4=ON whose package exports none of either fails.
#
# The same prefix is then used the way a Makefile, Meson or autotools build uses it, through its
# .pc files (cmake/PkgConfig.cmake), which are all such a build has. The C program is linked with
# the C compiler that configured the tree (cc when the tree has none) and the flags pkg-config
# prints, and nothing else. A prefix whose iclforge-c.pc names the static archive, the shape a
# vcpkg or Conan package has (ICLFORGE_INSTALL_BOTH_LINKAGES=OFF and BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF), is
# asked with --static, which is what puts Requires.private and Libs.private on the link line.
# Every link here runs with --as-needed, which GCC on Ubuntu does by default and clang does not:
# it drops an -lm that comes before the archive calling it, so a .pc that lists its libraries in
# the wrong order fails under either compiler. Each .pc that names an archive is also linked whole
# into an empty C program on its own, which finds what one component's file lacks even when no
# consumer reaches that archive. The two AC-4 programs are built the same way from iclforge-ac4.pc,
# by the C++ compiler that configured the tree, where the package has it. It needs pkg-config, or
# whatever $PKG_CONFIG names.
#
# Each optional library a tree was configured with (its ICLFORGE_BUILD_<NAME> option ON) installs
# its CMake export and its .pc file, and each it was configured without installs no file at all:
# the vcpkg port's features and the Conan recipe's options (packaging/) switch those same options,
# and a default install of either, without the container writers, the AC-4 library, IAB or IAMF,
# must carry none of their headers, libraries or targets. A tree configured with the AC-4
# libraries, IAB and IAMF off is that shape.
#
# Usage:  ./tools/checks/check_install_consumer.sh <build-dir>...
# Exit:   0 = every tree's archives linked whole, its consumers built and ran and its .pc files
#         linked, 2 = bad invocation, anything else = a step failed (its own output is above).
