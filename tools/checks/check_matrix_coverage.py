"""Does tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh actually mention every option the CLI has?

Every other check in this project asks "is the output correct". This one asks
a different question: "does anything exercise this at all". A new layout, a
new Annex E tool token, or a whole new command can land in the CLI without
anyone remembering to add it to the FFmpeg-oracle matrix - the matrix would
keep passing, green and silent, having never touched the new code path.

So this reads the CLI's own canonical option lists - not a second,
hand-maintained copy of them, which could drift from the real one exactly the
way the matrix itself can - and checks each token appears somewhere in
tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh. Three of the four checks below ask the binary
directly, via the same error-message path real bad input hits:

  commands   forge with no args prints its own usage table.
  layouts    forge sine/eac3-sine reject a bogus layout with
             "unknown layout 'X' (mono | stereo | ...)" - built from
             iclforge::ac3::plan::layout_names(codec), the same function 'sine' and
             'eac3-sine' validate a real layout against.
  tools      forge eac3-encode rejects a bogus tool set with
             "unknown tool set 'X' (none | cpl | ...)" - built from
             iclforge::ac3::plan::kToolsSyntax. This one IS a hand-maintained string
             (see plan.hpp), not derived from parse_tools()'s own token
             list, so it carries its own smaller drift risk one level
             removed from what this script checks - out of scope here.
  atmos mode objects/bed51 has no equivalent introspection (atmos's mode
             argument fails silently to whatever run_atmos's own validation
             does, not through a listable error), so this one stays a small
             hardcoded pair with a comment saying why, checked with the same
             presence test as everything else.
  vbr        eac3-encode's [vbr] argument is not a fixed enum - "off", a
             continuous quality float plus optional min:/max: bounds
             ("q:0..1[,min:kbps][,max:kbps]"), or an average-rate target
             ("avg:kbps[,win:frames]") - so there is no token list to diff
             the way layouts/tools have. This checks that SOME encode using
             each of the two RATE CONTROLS (a literal "q:" token, and a
             literal "avg:" token) appears in the matrix at all. They are
             separate checks because they are separate code paths: "q:"
             reads a fixed SNR offset, "avg:" steers one across frames, and
             a matrix that exercised only the first would say nothing about
             the second. First added after VBR support landed in the library
             with zero matrix coverage - the exact gap this whole script
             exists to catch - and only the CLI's own usage text said the
             [vbr] argument existed at all; the "avg:" half is checked the
             same way for the same reason.
  ac4        every command whose usage row names an AC-4 file (in.ac4 or
             out.ac4) - decode, probe, transcode, the containers and the rest
             planning/ac4.md's phase I1 taught AC-4 - must be run on AC-4 at
             least once: a `run <command>` line whose arguments name a file
             with "ac4" in it. A command can reach AC-4 only through its own
             code path for it (its own decoder, burst packer or track), so a
             command the matrix runs on AC-3 alone has left that path
             untouched, the gap the plain commands check cannot see. A build
             whose usage names no AC-4 file at all skips it, as an older
             build skips the vbr checks.

Coverage is a presence check for commands, layouts, Atmos modes and vbr: each
canonical token just has to appear as a whole word somewhere in the matrix
script. That is looser than confirming it is in the *right* loop, but it is
what makes those checks hard to fool by accident, and a false FAIL (a token
that really is exercised but the check cannot see it) is far cheaper here than
a false PASS (a real gap that stays invisible) - see CONTRIBUTING.md's
validation discipline. Those four have shown no collisions: their token sets
are distinctive enough that appearing anywhere in the script means what it
looks like it means.

The tools check is the one exception, and it is scoped rather than
whole-file. The presence check assumed a token could only collide with a token
- another option name, some identifier. What it did not anticipate was a token
colliding with an unrelated option *VALUE*: on 2026-08-17 the new `auto` tool
set was reported covered while it had no matrix leg at all, because the
metadata option `dialnorm=auto` elsewhere in the script supplied the whole-word
match. `auto` has a real leg now, but the shape of that failure is permanent -
any short tool token added later can collide the same way with any value
anywhere in the script. So tool tokens are gathered from the two places a tool
set is actually USED (matrix_tool_tokens below): every `for tools in ...` loop
header, and the tools argument of literal `run eac3-encode <wav> <out> <rate>
<tools> <layout>` calls. Being named there means being encoded with; being
named anywhere else no longer counts. The other four checks are deliberately
left on the looser whole-file test - narrowing a check that has never been
fooled would just add a way for it to be wrong.

Every check matches against the script with `#` comments stripped, so a
token that appears only in prose never counts as coverage.
