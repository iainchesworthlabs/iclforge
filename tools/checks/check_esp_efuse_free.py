"""Refuse ESP-IDF settings that would stop a board being recovered over USB.

A board flashed from this tree has to stay recoverable over USB: whatever goes
wrong with an image, `esptool write-flash` through the chip's ROM download mode
puts a working one back (planning/esp32-ota.md, "What stays USB-only, and how a
board is recovered"). Some ESP-IDF options take that away by burning eFuses,
which cannot be undone, and two more stop the bootloader checking an image
before it boots it, which the plan's integrity checks rely on. Any of them can
arrive as one line in an sdkconfig fragment, and nothing else in CI would
notice. This makes adding one a red job. Stdlib-only, run from ci.yml's
script-lint job and runnable the same way locally:

    python3 tools/checks/check_esp_efuse_free.py [--root <repo>]

It reads every sdkconfig fragment under the ESP-IDF projects the repository
holds (firmware/esp-idf/, firmware/hearth-sink/ and firmware/baremetal/): files
named sdkconfig.defaults or sdkconfig.<anything>, but not sdkconfig itself or
sdkconfig.old, which are a build's own output. Directories a build or the component manager writes
(build*, managed_components) are skipped, so a local tree with builds in it
checks the same as CI's clean checkout.

A setting counts only when a fragment turns it on (`CONFIG_X=y`). The form
menuconfig writes for off (`# CONFIG_X is not set`) and `=n` are both fine.

Exit 1 with one ::error:: line per refused setting, and also when no fragment
is found at all, so a moved tree cannot pass by checking nothing.
