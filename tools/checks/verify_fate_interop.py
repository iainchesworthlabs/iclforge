"""Decode pinned FFmpeg FATE AC-3/E-AC-3 samples and hold them against FFmpeg.

Third-party decode interop, step two. The first step decodes
tests/golden/external-baseline/ - six streams from Dolby's Encoding Engine and
FFmpeg's own encoder, produced from this repository's own source material -
with the in-repo decoder on every gold-reference leg. That is real third-party
structure, and it found five real Annex E decoder defects the moment it ran.
But both of those encoders were driven by this project, at rates and layouts
this project chose, on 2.5 s of synthetic fixture audio. This script widens the
corpus to streams nobody here commissioned: excerpts of commercially mastered
programme material, encoded years ago by whatever encoder the mastering house
used, exercising choices neither this project's encoder nor FFmpeg's makes -
spectral extension, 1536 kbit/s, a commentary track, dither on, per-block
exponent strategies, and the 3/1 acmod nothing in this tree can encode.

Why FATE and not a conformance suite: there isn't one to be had. ATSC A/52 and
ETSI TS 102 366 are both freely downloadable documents, but neither ATSC nor
ETSI publishes conformance BITSTREAMS for AC-3 or E-AC-3 the way MPEG does for
its own codecs, and Dolby's own verification material ships under licence with
its professional tools. Searching for a redistributable, citable vector set
came back empty (the same finding docs/verification.md records). FFmpeg's FATE
sample archive is the closest freely-fetchable substitute: the files are real
commercial encoder output, they are stable (most have not changed since 2010-
2011), and they are already the reference corpus for another decoder's own
regression suite.

Fetched, never committed. Each sample is pinned by SHA-256, so a silent change
upstream fails the run rather than quietly moving the numbers; the download
lands in a cache directory outside the repository. The archive is plain HTTP(S)
served content and the samples are excerpts of copyrighted films, which is the
other half of why they are not vendored here.

Usage:
    ICLFORGE_CLI=build/config-linux-llvm/bin/forge python3 tools/checks/verify_fate_interop.py

    --cache-dir DIR   where to keep downloads (default: $FATE_CACHE_DIR, else a
                      temporary directory removed on exit)
    --cli PATH        forge, overriding $ICLFORGE_CLI
    --list            print the pinned corpus and exit, downloading nothing

Exits non-zero on the first sample that fails.

# Every sample below was measured by hand against FFmpeg 8.0.1 on x86-64
# Windows and Linux while this file was written; the measured worst channel is
# quoted beside each floor, which is set about 9 dB under it - the same
# measured-minus-headroom basis tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh's own
# third-party floors use, and for the same reason: two independently correct
# decoders diverge on the parts of the reconstruction the standard leaves to
# the implementation (dither in bap == 0 bins above all, whose pseudo-random
# sequence is per-decoder), so the floor has to sit below that divergence
# while still failing hard on a defect.
#
# Three fields decide what each sample is actually gated on:
#
#   min_snr_db      the ratio form. Only meaningful where the excerpt has
#                   programme material in it.
#   max_diff_dbfs   the absolute form. Several of these excerpts are near-
#                   silent passages (-93 to -100 dBFS), where an SNR of 2 dB
#                   and an SNR of 40 dB are both consistent with a completely
#                   inaudible disagreement and no ratio floor can tell a
#                   defect apart from the noise floor. Those are gated on the
#                   difference signal's own level instead.
#   compare         False for a sample where the two decoders' output cannot
#                   be diffed at all. Then the assertions are "the in-repo
#                   decoder reads it" and "FFmpeg strict-decodes it", which is
#                   exactly the pair that caught the external-baseline defects.
#
# complete_bytes trims a trailing partial syncframe. Two of the AC-3 samples
# are byte-truncated excerpts (exactly 100,000 bytes), so their last frame is
# cut mid-way: FFmpeg reports "incomplete frame" and the in-repo decoder
# refuses the stream outright ("ends part-way through a frame"). Neither is a
# defect and neither is interesting, so the harness trims to the last complete
# frame first. The byte counts are pinned rather than computed, on the same
# basis as the hashes - the files they describe cannot change without the
# SHA-256 check firing first.
