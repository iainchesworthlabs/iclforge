# Packaging manifest consistency guard.
#
# Two things, at two different severities:
#
# 1. Internal inconsistency within a manifest (hard failure, exit 1): the kind a manual
#    copy-forward-and-edit bump (see docs/releasing.md's per-ecosystem steps) can
#    introduce - a version string updated in one file of a set but not another, a hash
#    of the wrong length, a URL that does not name the version it is filed under.
# 2. A latest-tag advisory (::warning::, never fails the check): does each manifest
#    actually point at the latest release. This was deliberately left out entirely
#    until manifest bump automation (.github/workflows/manifest-bump.yml) automated the bump - before
#    that, the four packaging bumps were a manual follow-up step done asynchronously
#    after a release went out (sometimes days later, in a separate PR), not atomically
#    with the tag, so a hard "must match the latest tag" gate would have failed by
#    design in the normal gap between tagging and getting around to the bump - noise,
#    not signal. Automating the bump's *start* does not close that gap outright (merging
#    the PR manifest-bump.yml opens is still a separate, reviewed step), which is why
#    this stays advisory rather than becoming the same hard gate.
#
# Usage:  ./tools/checks/check_packaging_versions.sh [-r <repo-root>]
# Exit:   0 = clean (an advisory warning does not affect this), 1 = inconsistency found.
