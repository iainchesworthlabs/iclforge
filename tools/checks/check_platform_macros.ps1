# Platform-isolation guard.
#
# iclforge branches on the operating system in CMake, never in the preprocessor:
# libs/audio/CMakeLists.txt picks one libs/audio/src/backend/<backend>/ directory
# (alsa/android/macos/pipewire/posix/windows) for the target OS, so exactly one
# audio_backend.cpp/capture.cpp/monitor.cpp/passthrough.cpp set is ever
# compiled. That only stays true if nobody reaches for an #ifdef, and an #ifdef
# is the path of least resistance the moment a second platform misbehaves --
# hence this check.
#
# The rule here is stricter than "no OS macros": NO preprocessor conditional of
# any kind is allowed in the trees below. The codebase has none today, so the
# check costs nothing to keep at zero, and zero is a far easier line to hold
# than "only the justified ones". Header-configuration defines that a platform
# header genuinely requires (WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, NOMINMAX) belong in
# target_compile_definitions -- see the WIN32 block in libs/audio/CMakeLists.txt
# for the worked example.
#
# The scan covered src/ and apps/ only until 2026-09-23, and tests/ had quietly
# become where every violation lived: nineteen copies of a `#ifdef _WIN32`
# getpid() branch, eight of a cmd.exe quoting one, eleven AVX2 cases whose
# bodies a non-x86_64 leg never even parsed, and an MSVC-only pair of ABI size
# assertions. Each is now the same directory-selected shape the rest of the
# tree uses -- tests/support/platform/<os>/, libs/ac3/tests/core/avx2/{present,absent}/,
# libs/render/tests/abi/{msvc,unknown}/ -- and python/ likewise
# (python/src/iclforge_ext/{signing,containers}/{present,absent}/), so every
# tree here starts at zero rather than being grandfathered in with a waiver list.
#
# NOT scanned, deliberately: esp-idf/. That tree is an ESP-IDF component built
# by idf.py, not by this repository's CMake, and its `#if CONFIG_*` guards are
# Kconfig symbols -- the documented IDF idiom, and in the CONFIG_SPIRAM case
# load-bearing in a way a directory split would not reproduce: on a target with
# no PSRAM bus, esp_psram_get_size() is never exposed to the linker at all
# (see esp-idf/iclforge/src/control.cpp's own comment). Holding this rule over
# somebody else's build system, with no toolchain here to verify against, would
# be a change made blind.
#
# Include guards are not affected: the codebase uses #pragma once.
#
# One other narrow exception, added for libs/capi/include/iclforge_c/iclforge.h
# (C API): `#ifdef __cplusplus` / `extern "C" {` / `#endif` is the
# standard idiom that lets one header be included from both a C and a C++
# translation unit, which a C-callable public header genuinely needs -
# `extern "C"` is not even legal syntax outside `#ifdef __cplusplus`, since a
# .c file's compiler does not know the token. This is a LANGUAGE-DIALECT
# marker, not a platform or feature branch - the thing this check exists to
# forbid - so a bare `#ifdef __cplusplus ... #endif` pair (no #else/#elif
# inside it) is tracked separately below and excluded from violations; every
# other conditional, including one that merely mentions __cplusplus in an
# #if/#elif expression alongside something else, is still flagged.
#
# Usage:  ./tools/checks/check_platform_macros.ps1 [-Root <repo-root>]
# Exit:   0 = clean, 1 = violation(s) found, 2 = bad invocation.
