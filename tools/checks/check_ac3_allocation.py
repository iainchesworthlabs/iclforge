"""Where does FFmpeg's AC-3 advantage actually come from?

This project's AC-3 encoder scores about 3 dB below FFmpeg's at matched
bitrate on the landscape leg (`ac3-51-448`). Two structural explanations are
visible in libs/ac3/src/encoder/encoder.cpp, and they are not distinguishable
from a single overall SNR number:

  shared fine SNR offset   Every channel is written the same `fsnroffst`
                           (~line 945) even though A/52 gives each its own
                           4-bit field, and the search optimises one
                           frame-wide composite offset. Bits cannot move
                           between channels, so an easy channel is served
                           more precision than it needs while a demanding
                           one is starved.

  fixed allocation codes   `const BitAllocCodes codes{}` (~line 374) pins
                           sdcycod/fdcycod/sgaincod/dbpbcod/floorcod to the
                           §8.2.12 basic-encoder defaults. Those shape the
                           masking curve itself and are never searched.

The two leave different fingerprints, which is what this measures:

  * A shared offset misallocates BETWEEN CHANNELS. Its deficit should vary
    channel to channel - large where a channel is demanding, small or even
    negative where it is easy - while looking similar across frequency.
  * A mis-shaped masking curve misallocates ACROSS FREQUENCY. Its deficit
    should vary band to band in the same pattern for every channel.

So both axes are reported: per-channel SNR, and per-band SNR averaged over
channels. Whichever axis carries the spread is the one worth fixing.

Deliberately NOT a pass/fail gate. It answers "which lever", and the answer
changes as the encoder does; `tools/ci/quality_race.py ci` remains the thing
with thresholds in it.

Both streams are decoded with THIS project's decoder, not FFmpeg's, so the
comparison isolates the two ENCODERS - a decoder difference would otherwise
land in the same number and be indistinguishable from an allocation one.
