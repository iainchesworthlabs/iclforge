"""Delay-compensated SNR between two WAVs - stdlib only, no numpy.

Used by tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh as the L4-lite half of the gold-
reference gate: FFmpeg's decode of forge's own encoder output is the
independent reference, forge's own decode of the same file is what is being
checked, and this asserts they agree to within a threshold rather than just
"neither one crashed."

Deliberately stdlib-only (wave/struct/math): GitHub-hosted runners ship
Python 3 preinstalled on Windows/Linux/macOS, so this adds zero new CI
provisioning the way pulling in numpy would.

Usage:  python compare_wav.py <reference.wav> <actual.wav> [--min-snr-db N] [--max-lag-samples N]
Exit 0 if every channel's SNR >= its threshold, exit 1 (with the offending
channel and its SNR) otherwise.

--min-snr-db-per-channel is the same gate stated per channel instead of once
for all of them, and it exists because one floor across six channels is not
one gate - it is one gate on the worst channel and dead slack on the rest.
On the 5.1 fixtures here the surrounds sit 20-60 dB below the front channels
by construction (the encoder spends fewer bits there, and §7.3.4 dither in the
zero-bit bins puts two independently correct decoders further apart still), so
a floor low enough for Ls/Rs to pass leaves L/R/C/LFE 30-70 dB of room to
collapse in silently. Every floor here was derived from that channel's own
measured minimum across every CI leg and every recorded commit - see
tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh, which carries the vectors and the
derivation.

--json-out additionally writes a structured result (per-channel SNR, lag,
per-channel thresholds and headroom, pass/fail) for a caller that wants to
persist the numbers rather than just gate on them - see docs/quality-trend.md.
--codec-label and --bitrate-kbps are pure passthrough metadata for that file;
this script does not care what codec produced its inputs.

--max-diff-dbfs is the other way of asking the same question, for material
where the SNR form cannot answer it. SNR is a RATIO, so on a passage that is
itself near the noise floor - which several of the FFmpeg FATE excerpts
tools/checks/verify_fate_interop.py fetches are, at -93 to -100 dBFS - a
completely inaudible disagreement still scores a couple of dB and no floor
can tell that apart from a real defect. The absolute form asserts on the
difference signal directly instead: every channel's RMS difference must sit
below the given dBFS. Both may be given, and both are then enforced.
