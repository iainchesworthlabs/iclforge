# Gives hearth_sink a network over Improv Wi-Fi under QEMU, and plays to the
# Sendspin player it starts once it has one (planning/hearth-reference-player.md,
# B2 and B4).
#
# A board with no network listens for Improv on its console. QEMU has no radio,
# so two images stand in for one board, each booted from a copy (QEMU writes
# to its flash image, and NVS is in it):
#
# - The Sendspin player on QEMU's Ethernet (sdkconfig.ci-sendspin), the image
#   run_sendspin_qemu.sh plays to, booted with its link down. Its boot gives up
#   on the network after 30 s. improv_qemu.py's late-network scenario then
#   sends it a network over Improv and brings the link up while it waits. The
#   board must answer with its page's URL, and start mDNS, the player and the
#   player's console commands. The test server then pairs with that player by
#   its token and plays to it, as run_sendspin_qemu.sh does to one started at
#   boot. check_sendspin_levels.py holds its levels to the test sink's, and
#   check_esp_console.py holds its console to one clean boot and the heap floor.
# - The same player on WiFi, with nothing stored and nothing built in
#   (sdkconfig.ci-wifi). improv_qemu.py's unprovisioned scenario holds it to its
#   control surface and to Improv's current_state and device_info answers, and
#   check_esp_console.py holds its console to one clean boot. It is never given
#   a network: QEMU has no radio for it to join one with.
#
# Before #741, the first board aborted in the network_up() Improv's task called,
# and the second restarted in a loop on an lwIP assertion.
