"""Compare a bare-metal probe run's PCM hashes with another run's, or with the
pinned ones (planning/arithmetic-tiers.md).

The probe prints one `<codec>.pcm_hash=<16 hex digits>` line per fixture it
decodes: FNV-1a over every delivered sample's bit pattern, in delivery order.
For the fixed-point tier the decode is integer arithmetic, so the value is
the same on every leg - the x86 host, the Cortex-M3 under QEMU, a RISC-V
part - and that identity is the tier's own gate: a hash that differs between
legs is arithmetic that is not integer somewhere, or a platform difference the
tier was built to have none of. The pinned values in
tests/golden/fixed-probe-pcm-hashes.json are what both CI legs are held to;
re-pin them when the tier's arithmetic changes on purpose. For the floating
tiers the hashes vary with the compiler and this check has nothing to say.

Usage:
    check_probe_hashes.py <run_a.txt> <run_b.txt>
    check_probe_hashes.py --expected <pins.json> <run.txt>

Exits non-zero when a fixture's hash differs, or when a fixture hashed on one
side is missing from the other without the run having said why. A run that
prints `<codec>.skipped=<reason>` - a target whose heap cannot hold that
fixture - is reported as skipped rather than failed.
