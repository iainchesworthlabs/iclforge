"""Score forge's AC-4 decoding of DEE's streams against the sources they were encoded from.

For each leg the decoder turns into PCM - SIMPLE and ASPX mono, stereo and 5.1, 5.1 in ASPX_ACPL_2
and ASPX_ACPL_3, and DEE's immersive stereo (IMS), at frame_rate_index 13, and IMS at 23.976, 24,
25 and 29.97 fps through the sample rate converter (see
src/ac4/include/iclforge/ac4/decoder/decoder.hpp) - this decodes the stream with `forge decode`,
aligns the output with its reference by cross-correlation, fits a least-squares gain per channel,
and checks (planning/ac4.md, the decoder's ladder, item 3):

  lag      the output lags the source by the leg's LAG: DEE's encoder delay plus this decoder's,
           1 313 samples at index 13 (Part 1 Table 188's d_pcm, the QMF banks' 577 samples and six
           QMF slots of history, for every codec mode: src/ac4/ERRATA.md, "Every codec mode
           passes through the QMF banks"). DEE's IMS encoder runs a frame shorter than its AC-4
           encoder. At the other frame rates, the lag first measured (LAG_AT_RATE); the A-SPX
           subbands there are the internal rate's.
  gain     every channel of a mono, 2.0 or 5.1 leg within 0.2 dB of unity, fitted below the
           crossover in ASPX. The streams were made with loudness measured only, and they are
           decoded with no output level, which leaves them at their coded level and uncompressed,
           so the prediction is the source's own level (gain_ac4_decode.py checks the output
           level and the downmixes). A 5.1
           leg's LFE, which DEE low-passes before coding it (LFE_CHANNEL's comment), within 0.5 dB,
           from 20 to 100 Hz. An IMS leg, made from 5.1, is compared with the source's Lo/Ro
           downmix (L + C/sqrt 2 + Ls/sqrt 2 and its mirror), which its channels must correlate with
           at 0.95 or better; its render is DEE's, so its level is only reported.
  SNR      every channel's signal-to-noise ratio against the gain-scaled reference at or above its
           floor, the first measurement less 1 dB: over the whole band for SIMPLE and for the LFE,
           which A-SPX leaves out, and below the A-SPX crossover for the other channels in ASPX,
           from 2 048-point STFT frames.
  tiles    for ASPX, above each channel's crossover, each 2 048-sample frame's energy in each
           low-resolution A-SPX subband group against the reference's, in dB, where the
           reference's is above -95 dB per subband: the mean of their absolute differences at or
           below its ceiling, the first measurement plus 0.5 dB. DEE quantises these envelopes in
           1.5 or 3 dB steps.
  LSD      tools/ci/quality_race.py's log-spectral distance at or below its ceiling, the first
           measurement plus 0.5 dB.
  MOS      ViSQOL's MOS-LQO (quality_race.perceptual_score) at or above its floor, the first
           measurement less 0.1, where visqol-python is installed.
  routing  on a tone leg, each channel's own tone at least 40 dB above every other channel's tone
           in it; in the A-CPL legs, at least the margin first measured less 3 dB, since the
           parameters are per band and a tone near a band's edge reaches its neighbour.

The A-CPL legs code a pair of downmixes and make the surrounds of them (and in ASPX_ACPL_3 the
centre), so their channels are scored as A-CPL rebuilds them:

  downmix  the coded downmixes, recovered from the output, against the source's as waveforms, SNR
           below the crossover at or above its floor, the first measurement less 1 dB: in
           ASPX_ACPL_2 (L + Ls / sqrt 2) / 2 and its mirror, which the upmix keeps exactly
           (Part 1 Pseudocode 117), with C and the LFE as they are; in ASPX_ACPL_3 the Lo/Ro
           downmix over 1 + sqrt 2, which it keeps as closely as gamma's quantisation allows
           (Pseudocode 118), with the LFE.
  bands    per A-CPL parameter band (Part 1 Table 197, 15 bands) over 2 048-sample frames, for the
           pairs A-CPL rebuilds, (L, Ls) and (R, Rs): the mean distance of the output's level
           difference from the source's, and of its correlation, the larger of the two pairs', at
           or below ceilings of the first measurement plus 0.5 dB and 0.05. Music and film legs
           only; a tone leg's bands hold little but its tones.

score_ac4_encode.py scores the encoder's A-CPL legs with the same checks, which also take
ASPX_ACPL_1, whose downmixes are ASPX_ACPL_2's, and the channel pair's A-CPL, whose downmix is
(L + R) / 2 and whose one pair is (L, R).

The crossovers and the subband groups come from the leg's first aspx_config() and the
aspx_xover_subband_offset of each aspx_data element in that frame, a channel's being the element
Part 1 Table 213 gives it, read from `forge decode ... syntax-trace=`, through Part 1
Pseudocodes 67 to 69.

The committed legs (tests/golden/external-baseline/) made with loudness measured only are scored
by default; their sources are rebuilt by tools/generators/gen_ac4_baseline.py from the committed
FLAC fixtures, which needs ffmpeg on PATH. --gold DIR scores phase G0's local gold set in DIR
instead (DIR/streams/<leg>/dee.ac4, DIR/sources/<source>.wav, DIR/gold-manifest.json), which never
runs in CI.

--measure prints what every leg measures, as the PINS lines to pin it with, and checks nothing.
