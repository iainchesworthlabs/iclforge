# Prove that an executable built with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON runs its iclforge:: code from the
# shared libraries of the codec, not from a second copy of it that reached the executable
# another way.
#
# The shared-libs pass (config-linux-llvm-shared, .github/workflows/_ci-linux.yml) exists to show
# that every in-tree consumer links and runs against the real .so. For iclforge-tests it did not: the
# C API library embeds the codec as a static archive, exported its C++ symbols, and put the archive
# on the link line of whatever linked it, all of them ahead of the codec's .so. Every test still
# passed, on code that was never in the .so. A passing test suite cannot show this, which is why
# this looks at the binding itself.
#
# The codec is six libraries (iclforge_ac3, base, dsp, objects, render and iec61937), and all of
# them export iclforge:: symbols, so they are all given. Two questions, both about the
# iclforge:: C++ symbols the libraries export:
#
#   1. Where does the dynamic linker bind the ones the executable imports? Read from
#      LD_DEBUG=bindings with LD_BIND_NOW=1, so every import is resolved at load whether or not a
#      test would have called it. Each must bind to the library that exports it.
#   2. Does the executable define any of them itself? A definition linked in from a static archive
#      is used ahead of the shared library and binds nothing, so the first question cannot see it.
#      None may be.
#
# It also fails if nothing binds to the libraries at all, since an executable that links no
# codec symbols would pass both questions for the wrong reason.
#
# libstdc++ template instantiations that the libraries export are left out: every C++ binary
# carries its own copy of those, and the executable's is meant to win.
