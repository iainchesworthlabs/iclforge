"""Assert the paths the documentation and the CI plumbing name still exist.

A file that moves takes its README row, its workflow step and the comments
that cite it along only when someone remembers. This makes forgetting a red
job. Three checks, all stdlib-only, run from ci.yml's script-lint job and
runnable the same way locally:

    python3 tools/checks/check_doc_paths.py [--root <repo>]

(a) Every relative Markdown link under docs/**/*.md and in README.md,
    CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md and CHANGELOG.md resolves to a file or a
    directory, and its #anchor names a heading on the page it lands on.
    http(s)/mailto targets are skipped, and links inside fenced code blocks and
    inline code spans are ignored (they are examples of the syntax, not links).
    A link whose text wraps across a line break is still one link, so links are
    matched over a whole paragraph rather than a line at a time, and reported
    against the line each one opens on. ROADMAP.md is held to the opposite
    rule: it is read both on GitHub and as a snippet included into
    docs/roadmap.md, so a relative link there can only resolve from one of the
    two places. Every link in it must be an absolute http(s) URL or a bare
    #anchor (docs/roadmap.md states that rule), and anything else fails.

    The anchor half is the reason this script runs where it does. A heading
    renamed in one branch and linked from another leaves both branches
    internally consistent and the merge of them broken, which is a state no
    per-branch run ever builds. ci.yml's script-lint job has no event gating,
    so main's merge queue evaluates this over each entry's merged tree and the
    pair is caught there; an ordinary link to a heading that never existed is
    caught on the pull request, before that. What a heading's id is - the two
    slugifiers this repo's pages are read through, and which of their
    disagreements matter - is set out at ATX_HEADING below, and pinned against
    the real renderer by test_check_doc_paths.py's HeadingSlugs.

(b) Every path a documentation page names in its own prose or a code span,
    as opposed to in a link, resolves. A page can go on citing a directory for
    years after the tree moved it, because nothing was reading those. Fenced
    blocks are exempt (shell transcripts and source listings, not claims about
    the tree), and so are the pages in PROSE_PATHS_UNCHECKED below: a plan
    proposing a layout, a phase record describing the tree before a rename,
    and CHANGELOG.md, whose released entries are immutable. Their links are
    still checked; only their prose is exempt.

(c) Every path literal starting docs/, apps/, src/ or tools/ inside
    .github/workflows/*.yml, cmake/**/*.cmake, CMakePresets.json and
    tools/**/*.{py,sh,ps1} names something that exists. Conservative on
    purpose. A token has to start at a word boundary, contain a slash and end
    at whitespace, a quote or a bracket; a trailing #anchor is a section
    reference, not part of the path, and is stripped before the check. Four
    shapes are skipped rather than judged, each printed as one info line so
    what the check declines to answer stays visible:

      - globs (* ?), placeholders (${...}, $var, %var%) and identifiers a
        comment wrapped mid-token, which name no single path. A brace group is
        no longer one of these: `a/{b,c}/d` expands to one path per alternative
        and each is checked, since skipping the token meant none of the
        siblings ever was;
      - anything .gitignore covers, which is generated rather than stale:
        spec/'s standards documents, build/ outputs, the Android
        signing-key asset a runner materialises, src/quarantine;
      - the tokens in FOREIGN_PATHS below, which are references into another
        project's source tree or into a subdirectory of this one, and are
        listed one by one with their reason rather than guessed at;
      - test_*.py under tools/, whose path literals are fixtures for a
        temporary tree and not references into this one;
      - the trees in UNCHECKED_LITERAL_TREES below, each with its reason.

Exit 1 with one ::error:: line per missing target, naming file:line.

# agree on ordinary prose and differ on the edges - mkdocs (python-markdown's
# `toc`, which mkdocs.yml selects by configuring `toc` with nothing but
# `permalink`) folds non-ASCII to ASCII, collapses a run of hyphens to one and
# disambiguates a repeated heading with `_1`; GitHub keeps the run, keeps the
# non-ASCII and counts with `-1`. So a fragment is accepted when it matches
# under either. That is deliberately the loose reading: CONTRIBUTING.md and
# ROADMAP.md are genuinely read both ways (docs/ includes them verbatim via
# pymdownx.snippets), CHANGELOG.md and planning/ only ever on GitHub, and a
# check that picked one slugifier per file would fail a link that resolves
