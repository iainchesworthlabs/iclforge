"""Gate the AC-4 decoder's float and fixed-point builds against its double build, on every
committed stream (planning/ac4.md, D14a and D14d).

`ICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR=float` builds the decoder's QMF banks, transforms, A-SPX, A-CPL and
the rest of libs/ac4/src/decoder/pcm in `float`, and `ICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR=fixed` in Q7.24 with
block exponents; the default builds them in `double`. This decodes each committed AC-4 stream
with the double CLI and the other tier's and holds the second decode to the first, in two
regions of each channel's spectrum:

  below   from 0 to the lowest crossover (sbx) of the frame's aspx_data elements, where every
          channel is waveform-coded and the two builds differ by rounding through the
          transforms and the QMF banks;
  above   from the highest crossover to 24 kHz, where A-SPX has recreated the band from the
          low band's QMF subbands, gains and noise, and the two builds part further.

Between the two, where a channel's crossover is not another's, the streams are left out of
both. A stream with no A-SPX has one region, the whole band, reported as `below`.

The SNR of a region is the signal's energy over the error's, summed over half-overlapped Hann
frames of 2 048 samples, in dB, and the figure of a stream is its worst channel's; a channel
with less than MIN_ENERGY_PER_FRAME in a region is not scored there (the LFE above a crossover).
The error's level in dBFS, the energy of a full-scale sine in a frame being 0 dB, is printed
beside them. What is gated is each figure against the pin of
testdata/ac4/scalar-agreement.json for the float tier, or of
testdata/ac4/scalar-agreement-fixed.json for the fixed-point one, which hold floors: the
figure measured with the double CLI as the reference, less a margin.

What it does not answer is whether either decode is RIGHT: the scorers do that, with a float
CLI in CI. Two builds agreeing says they agree.

numpy is needed to measure (the AC-4 scorers need it too) and not to read the pins, which
tools/checks/test_check_ac4_decode_scalar_snr.py does under the plain-stdlib oracle test run.

Usage:
    check_ac4_decode_scalar_snr.py --double-cli <path> (--float-cli <path> | --fixed-cli <path>)
                                   [--workdir <dir>] [--pins <json>] [--write-pins <json>]
                                   [--streams <path>...]

--write-pins records the figures of this run, less the margin, as the pins.
