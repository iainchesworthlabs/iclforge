"""Do the committed fixtures still match testdata/audio/corpus.json?

The fixture corpus is the one input every published quality number in this
project is measured against - docs/landscape.md, docs/quality-trend.md and
docs/tool-comparison-trend.md all plot series whose points are only
comparable to each other because the material under them never moved. It is
also the input least likely to be noticed changing: a fixture is a binary, a
regenerated one still decodes, still has the right duration and channel
count, and still produces a perfectly plausible SNR. The series it belongs to
would simply have a step in it that looks like an encoder change.

So this hashes every fixture the manifest names and fails if any of them
differs, plus the cheap structural facts (channels, sample rate, bit depth,
duration) so a mismatch says what actually changed rather than just "hash
differs". Regenerating a fixture on purpose means rerunning its generator AND
bumping corpus_version - see tools/generators/gen_programme_fixtures.py's
CORPUS_VERSION - which is a visible line in a PR diff instead of a silent
binary swap.

stdlib-only, no build required, seconds to run: same no-new-CI-provisioning
reasoning as every tools/ci/append_*.py script.
