"""Holds the ESP32 player's plays of its stream set to the set's manifest.

The stream set is firmware/hearth-sink/www/ and its
manifest streams.json (tools/generators/gen_device_streams.py writes both).
The manifest gives, for each stream, the level each slot of a 7.1.4 output
should get: the host decoder's, as coded. The player prints what it sent to
each slot at the end of every play (stream.rms[n], RMS x 1e6), so a console
capture is enough to check a play against the host.

    check_stream_set.py check <streams.json> <console> [--all]
        Checks every play the console shows of a stream in the manifest. With
        --all, also fails if a stream the manifest expects the shape to play
        (every one not marked psram) has no play in the console.

    check_stream_set.py play <streams.json> <console> --device <url> --base <url>
        Plays every stream not marked psram, one POST /play at a time, waiting
        for each play's verdict on the console, and checks each as above - and
        what GET /status says about it, where the firmware reports the fields.

A play passes when it printed result=pass, skipped no bytes looking for a
sync word, decoded the manifest's access units (played and held together),
reported twelve slots, and every slot's level is the manifest's to within 1%
+ 20, with a slot the manifest has at 0 at exactly 0, since nothing in the
stream is there and the player does not upmix. The other ESP32 steps allow
5% + 200 for the float32 decode against the host's float64; over the set's
34 plays on 2026-09-11 the largest difference was one unit, and 1% still
catches a channel in the wrong slot, a doubled programme or a fold. A stream
the manifest marks refused must fail, for the reason it names. A panic or
second boot anywhere fails the run; tools/checks/check_esp_console.py is
the fuller check of that and runs after this in CI.

Standard library only: the ESP32 job's container has python3 and no pip.
