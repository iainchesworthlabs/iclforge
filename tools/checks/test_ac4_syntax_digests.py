"""The AC-4 reference parser against the committed syntax digests.

tools/references/ac4_syntax.py reads the syntax of every AC-4 substream a
frame holds, transcribed from ETSI TS 103 190-1 and -2 separately from the
decoder in src/ac4/src/decoder, and summarises what it read as one digest line per
frame and substream: how many syntax elements, where the last one ended, and a
CRC-32 over every element's (bit offset, width, value). The digests of the
committed DEE streams are under tests/golden/ac4/, and
tests/ac4/decoder/test_ac4dec_syntax.cpp requires the decoder to produce the same
lines. This test is the other half: it requires the reference parser still to
produce them, so neither transcription can change alone.

stdlib `unittest`, run by ci.yml's script-lint job with the other oracle
tests; the reference parser is stdlib-only for the same reason.

Run: python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/checks -p 'test_*.py'
