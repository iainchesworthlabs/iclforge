"""Gate a second decode scalar's path against the double one (minimum-footprint decoder profile).

Written for the float32 path and used for the fixed-point one too
(planning/arithmetic-tiers.md): --float-cli names whichever build is under
test, and --min-snr-db the floor that build is held to.

`ICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR=float` builds the decoder's coefficient stores,
transform scratch and overlap-add history as `float` instead of `double` - the
arithmetic the minimum-footprint profile has used since the ESP32-S3 port, and
the arithmetic every bare-metal fixture is decoded with. Nothing measured it.

docs/building.md records "~139 dB worst-channel SNR against the double decode
across four streams", and that number was true when it was taken. It came from
a build made by hand: until the scalar was split onto its own CMake axis
(libs/ac3/variants/, ICLFORGE_DECODE_SCALAR) it could only be float in a
configuration that was ALSO decode-only and had no `forge` to compare with. So
the figure has sat in prose for months with nothing able to re-derive it, while
the path it describes is the one two CI legs decode every fixture through.

This runs both builds over the same streams and holds the worst channel to a
floor. Delay-compensated per-channel SNR, via tools/checks/compare_wav.py -
the same comparison verify_gold_reference.sh already uses, pointed at two
decodes of one bitstream rather than at a decode and its source.

What it does NOT answer: whether either decode is RIGHT. Two builds agreeing
says they agree. verify_gold_reference.sh is what checks a decode against the
programme it came from, and running that with a float32 CLI is the other half
of this - see docs/building.md's Gaps.

Usage:
    check_decode_scalar_snr.py --double-cli <path> --float-cli <path>
                               --workdir <dir> [--min-snr-db N]

The workdir must already hold the streams verify_gold_reference.sh's encode
step writes (gold.ac3, gold.ec3, gold_cpl.ec3); this does not encode, so the
two CLIs are never asked to agree about anything but decoding.
