# Coverage report + per-component statement/branch gate.
#
# One gcov extraction pass over an ICLFORGE_ENABLE_COVERAGE build (the
# config-linux-gcc-coverage preset - see CMakePresets.json), then one cheap
# gate pass per component off the shared JSON trace. Line and branch coverage
# are gated PER COMPONENT rather than as one blended number: src/ac3 is an
# order of magnitude larger than any container writer, so a blend would let a
# real regression in src/containers/src/mpegts or src/capi hide inside ordinary drift in
# src/ac3 - and "which module is thin" is exactly the question a
# per-component table exists to answer.
#
# apps/cli is gated here too (coverage floors), not just src/. It is about 6,500
# lines across seven command modules, it is the executable the codec matrix,
# the gold-reference gate and the encoder-space fuzzer all drive, and it had
# no floor at all - while the two CLI bugs this project has actually shipped
# (the stdout/stderr leak and the Windows argv mangling) were both in exactly
# that kind of silently untested front-end path. Its per-command breakdown is
# printed below the gate so a thin command shows up as thin rather than
# averaging away inside the aggregate.
#
# apps/gui is NOT gated and is deliberately out of scope. Its C++ needs a Qt
# kit on the coverage leg, and no Linux CI leg installs one today
# (.github/workflows/_build.yml installs Qt only on the `gui: true` matrix
# entries, which are plain builds, not instrumented ones). Adding it means
# either putting Qt on the coverage job or standing up a second instrumented
# leg - a separate decision with its own runner-time cost, not something to
# smuggle in behind a threshold table. apps/gui's interactive surfaces are
# covered by its own Qt Quick tests, and its Qt-free pieces are exercised by
# iclforge-tests on every leg even though no row below gates them: RecordingSink
# (since moved to apps/common) and, from 2026-09-06,
# apps/gui/gui_diagnostics.cpp, whose whole reason for being Qt-free is that
# the no-secrets rule it holds is checked on legs that build no window.
#
# apps/crucible is out of scope here for the same reason and gated anyway,
# somewhere else: tools/checks/coverage_crucible.ps1 holds its line and branch
# floors and runs on the Windows clang-cl leg, where a Qt kit already is
# (.github/workflows/_build.yml, "Crucible coverage floor"). Most of that tree
# only executes under Qt - the window, its controller, and the Qt Quick suites
# that are the only thing driving its platform seams - so a figure taken in
# this job would cover the platform-free engine core and nothing else.
#
# src/sendspin and apps/hearth (Hearth, planning/hearth-reference-player.md) ARE gated here,
# unlike apps/crucible above: config-linux-gcc-coverage is the one coverage preset that turns
# ICLFORGE_BUILD_HEARTH on (CMakePresets.json), and both iclforge::sendspin and hearth_engine link
# iclforge::coverage themselves for exactly the reason apps/cli's own link does - see their
# CMakeLists.txt. apps/hearth/testsink joins the apps/hearth row (its sources link into iclforge-tests
# too); apps/hearth/testserver does not, since nothing on this leg ever runs that executable, and
# apps/hearth/ui is Qt - same reason apps/gui is out of scope above, no Qt kit on this leg.
#
# Run by .github/workflows/ci.yml's coverage job after `ctest`; runnable
# locally the same way, from the repository root (see docs/building.md):
#
#   cmake --preset config-linux-gcc-coverage
#   cmake --build --preset build-linux-gcc-coverage -- -k 0
#   ctest --preset test-linux-gcc-coverage -LE Performance
#   ./tools/checks/coverage_report.sh -g gcov-16
#
# Thresholds sit a few points under each component's measured baseline (the
# table below records the measurement each floor was set against) so ordinary
# in-flight churn does not trip the gate while a real regression still fails
# the job. Raise them as the suite grows rather than leaving the headroom in
# place indefinitely - see ci.yml's coverage job comment for the calibration
# history and why hosted-runner numbers are the calibration authority.
#
# Usage:  ./tools/checks/coverage_report.sh [-b <build-dir>] [-g <gcov-executable>]
# Exit:   0 = every gate met, 1 = at least one gate missed or a component had
#         no coverage data at all. Every component is reported before the
#         failure exit, so the log always shows the whole table rather than
#         just the first miss.

# Component floors, one row per component: <path> <line%> <branch%>. A path,
# not a bare name, since coverage floors added apps/ alongside src/.
#
# Calibrated 2026-08-20 (src/*) and 2026-08-24 (apps/cli, re-measured after
# merging container readers (mkv/mp4/ts)'s container-reader/probe work) against WSL2 runs on
# the CI toolchain pins (gcov 15.2.0, gcovr 8.6), measured per component as:
#
#   forge 93.2/86.0 audio 34.2/22.8   signing 89.2/68.9  matroska 92.9/87.7
#   mp4 94.9/92.5   mpegts 94.1/90.7  capi 87.8/79.2      ac3adm 87.9/82.4
#   admbridge 91.8/85.6               apps/cli 54.0/46.5
#
# Each floor sits ~4-8 points under its measurement: a couple of points for
# the known WSL-reads-higher-than-hosted effect (see ci.yml's coverage job
# comment), the rest as ordinary in-flight-churn headroom. Re-check against
# the first hosted run and tighten if the margin proves generous.
#
# src/audio's floor used to be low because its measurement was: no test
# opened an audio device, so the ALSA capture/monitor/passthrough paths never
# ran headless. They do now, against software devices (see the 2026-09-24
# note below). src/capi's remaining gap is src/capi/src/internal.hpp's guard()
# catch clauses and the defensively unreachable enum fallthroughs beside them.
#
# apps/cli's device commands (audio_io, live_audio) used to execute only to
# the extent the runner had a capture or render endpoint, which differed
# between a developer's WSL and a headless CI container. The software-device
# suites give both the same endpoints, so apps/cli's margin no longer has to
# absorb that difference.
#
# Re-measured 2026-09-24 after the coverage review that added the ALSA
# software-device suites (tests/audio/alsa_null_device.hpp), the AC-4 syntax
# suites and the CLI/Crucible/Hearth/IAB edge suites, on GCC 14.2 / gcovr 8.6
# (not the CI pin - hence the ~4-6 point margins rather than tighter ones):
#
#   forge 93.6/87.7   audio 78.1/64.3   signing 95.3/83.1  matroska 93.6/88.1
#   mp4 93.7/88.6     mpegts 96.8/90.0  capi 88.0/78.9     ac3adm 87.2/81.5
#   admbridge 93.3/84.0                 sendspin 90.4/80.2 apps/cli 86.1/77.8
#   apps/hearth 92.4/83.1               ac4 98.0/93.4      ac4dec 92.7/85.4
#   ac3iab 95.4/92.9  iamf 96.1/96.2    apps/common 83.3/71.9
#   apps/crucible/engine 95.9/87.8
#
# forge is six components since the layout change of planning/layout.md, one row each below. Measured
# on the split code the same way (GCC 16 / gcovr 8.6, WSL2, the 3,250 tests of the coverage leg):
#
#   ac3 94.5/87.9    base 88.8/64.7    dsp 87.7/94.7
#   objects 93.3/86.3  render 96.3/89.5  iec61937 96.9/89.6
#
# base is 107 lines and 68 branches, so a single line moves its figures by about one and a half
# points and its floors are set further under than the rest.
#
# src/audio and apps/cli's device commands no longer depend on the runner
# having an audio endpoint: their success paths run against alsa-lib's
# built-in null/file/route/multi plugins. What they still miss needs a real
# card (snd_card_next() walks /dev/snd/controlC* directly), so src/audio's
# floor is the agreed 70%-class floor for hardware-bound code rather than
# 85%. apps/common is below 85% for the same reason: sink_wait.hpp's play and
# passthrough instantiations only run against a card. src/sendspin and
# apps/hearth now have a real measurement behind their floors.
#
# AC-4 is one library since planning/consolidation.md's C1: the inspector's floor was 93/88 and the
# decoder's and the core's 88/80, and the encoder, now among its files, was not measured. Until a
# coverage run measures the merged library, it takes the lowest of the three.
#
# C2 moved signing's key, hash and MAC into src/base and its signer into src/ac3, whose floors are
# under signing's 90/76 and stay as they were, and admbridge into src/adm, which takes the lower of
# the two floors (82/75 and 88/78) until a coverage run measures it.
#
# C3 merged mp4 (90/85), mpegts (92/85), matroska (88/85), iamf (91/90) and iec61937 (91/83) into
# src/containers, which takes the lowest line and branch floors of the five until a coverage run
# measures it.
#
# apps/crucible/engine is the platform-free engine core iclforge-tests compiles in;
# the rest of apps/crucible keeps its own floors in coverage_crucible.ps1.

# The one expensive pass: run gcov over every object file and keep the result

#
# --gcov-ignore-parse-errors=suspicious_hits.warn: mdct.cpp's
# ForwardCosTable-driven hot loop (src/ac3/src/core/mdct.cpp) trips a documented gcov
# bug (gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla#68080, a false "suspicious hit value" on a tight
# accumulation loop) that otherwise aborts gcovr outright rather than just
# under/over-reporting that one line's count - gcovr's own error message
# names this exact flag as the fix. Warn, not skip, so a genuinely new
# suspicious-hit line elsewhere still shows up in the log instead of
# vanishing silently.
#
# "$build_dir" as the search path: without one gcovr searches --root (the
# whole checkout) for .gcda files, so a second instrumented tree under build/
# - a GUI or PipeWire configuration beside this one - was folded into these
# figures with its own copies of the same sources.
#
# --gcov-ignore-parse-errors=negative_hits.warn: the same gcov bug
# (bugzilla#68080), a different symptom - a negative rather than suspicious
# hit count. Confirmed independently at two unrelated sites, both the same
# shape of tight, heavily-optimized conditional logic as mdct.cpp's loop:
# bitalloc_memo.hpp:42's memo-validity check (a short-circuited boolean
# chain, `return valid && sample_rate == rate && csnroffst == csnr && ...`)
# and a branch inside joc.cpp:1163's nested early-return decision tree.
# gcovr's own error message names this exact flag too; each ignored category
# is its own flag (gcovr's --gcov-ignore-parse-errors appends per occurrence
# rather than replacing) so a genuinely new problem in either category still
# shows up rather than both going quiet under one blanket `all`.
# -fprofile-update=atomic would remove the threaded-code form of the race,
# but it made the DSP-heavy cases 2-6x slower (the ten-minute playout case
# 4.9 s -> 30.8 s), so the flag stays.
