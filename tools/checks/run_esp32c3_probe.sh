# WHAT THIS GATES that the other two legs do not.
#
# The C3 has no floating-point unit, which is why the fixed-point tier exists,
# and it is a third ARCHITECTURE: RV32IMC beside x86-64 and Thumb-2. The tier's
# central claim is that its decode is bit-identical on every machine, integer
# arithmetic having no rounding mode, no fused multiply-add and no C library's
# last bit to differ by. Two architectures agreeing is a coincidence a third
# can break, so this leg holds the probe's <codec>.pcm_hash lines to the same
# pinned values (testdata/fixed-probe-pcm-hashes.json) the host and the
# Cortex-M3 leg are held to. That check is this leg's reason for existing; the
# footprint ceilings below are the ordinary ones every probe leg carries.
#
# NOT speed. QEMU is not cycle-accurate and reports a CPU clock that disagrees
# with its own boot log, so the probe's us_per_frame lines are shape only. The
# instruction counts that mean something come from the Cortex-M3 leg's -icount
# mode (docs/performance-trend.md); what a C3 does per frame in cycles needs a
# board.
