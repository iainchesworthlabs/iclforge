"""Score forge's AC-4 encoder: its streams, decoded, against their sources.

planning/ac4.md, the encoder's ladder, items 4 and 5, as phases E1 to E5 and E8 need them: SIMPLE,
ASPX and A-CPL, mono, stereo, 5.0 and 5.1, at frame_rate_index 13 and, in the frame-rate legs, the
others, and the immersive element's 5.1.4. Each leg encodes a source with `forge
ac4-encode`, which picks the codec mode from the rate, decodes the stream with `forge decode`,
aligns the output with the source by cross-correlation, fits a least-squares gain per channel,
and checks, as score_ac4_decode.py scores DEE's streams:

  lag      the output lags the source by LAG samples: the encoder's delay, a frame and a half,
           and the decoder's, 1 313 at frame_rate_index 13 (score_ac4_decode.py);
  gain     every channel within 0.2 dB of unity, where its SNR is 20 dB or more: below that the
           least-squares gain of a coarse quantiser's output is no measure of level. In ASPX the
           gain is fitted below the crossover, where the output is the source's waveform, and a
           5.1 leg's LFE's is taken from 20 to 100 Hz, as score_ac4_decode.py takes it;
  SNR      every channel's signal-to-noise ratio at or above its floor, the first measurement
           less 1 dB (FLOORS): over the whole band in SIMPLE and for the LFE, and in ASPX below the
           crossover of the aspx_data element that carries the channel, which the stream's own
           aspx_config() and aspx_data elements give (score_ac4_decode.py's ASPX_UNIT);
  tiles    in ASPX, above the crossover, the mean absolute difference between the A-SPX tiles'
           energy and the source's at or below its ceiling, the first measurement plus 0.5 dB;
  LSD      tools/ci/quality_race.py's log-spectral distance at or below its ceiling, the first
           measurement plus 0.5 dB;
  MOS      ViSQOL's MOS-LQO (quality_race.perceptual_score) at or above its floor, the first
           measurement less 0.1, where visqol-python is installed;
  routing  on a tone leg, each channel's tone at least 40 dB above the other channel's in it.

The A-CPL legs, 5.1 at 96 and 128 kbps, where the encoder picks ASPX_ACPL_3 and ASPX_ACPL_2 as
DEE does, 5.0 in ASPX_ACPL_2, and the experimental ASPX_ACPL_1 and A-CPL in stereo, are scored as
score_ac4_decode.py scores DEE's A-CPL legs: the coded downmixes, recovered from the output, as
waveforms below the crossover; per A-CPL parameter band the distance of each rebuilt pair's level
difference and correlation from the source's; on a tone leg the routing margin; LSD and MOS. Their
pins are ACPL_FLOORS, in score_ac4_decode.py's ACPL_PINS form. The codec mode is read from the
decode's syntax trace.

The sources are 5 s long: the committed programme fixtures' 2.0 cuts, their 5.1 music and film
mixes and one tone per channel, rebuilt by tools/generators/gen_ac4_baseline.py (which reads the
FLAC fixtures with ffmpeg, so ffmpeg must be on PATH); the mono downmixes and the 5.1 music
without its LFE; and synthetic signals made here: a sweep, noise, castanet-like bursts after
silence, and a source panned between the channels, which the encoder's stereo prediction codes.
A leg may name ac4-encode's options after its rate: the -configs legs take the experimental coding
configurations.

The immersive legs (phase E8) encode tones and music in 5.1.4, from 192 to 768 kbps, where the
encoder picks ASPX_ACPL_2, ASPX_SCPL and SCPL as DEE does, and in ASPX_ACPL_1 by name
(experimental), and score each in full and in core decoding with score_ac4_decode.py's
score_immersive(): per channel (in full decoding ASPX_ACPL_2's top pairs as their sums, which A-CPL
keeps; in core decoding the 5.1.2 the core renders to) the lag, the level, the SNR below the lowest
crossover (in SCPL below 16 kHz), on a tone leg the routing margin, the LSD and the MOS, pinned in
IMMERSIVE_FLOORS. In full decoding the A-SPX tiles above the lowest crossover, and in the
parametric modes the level difference and correlation per A-CPL parameter band of the pairs the
parameters shape, are held to IMMERSIVE_EXTRA as the tiles and bands above are held. Those pairs
are the top pairs A-CPL rebuilds in ASPX_ACPL_1 and 2, and in ASPX_AJCC (experimental) each
side's front (L, Tfl) and back (Ls, Tbl), whose A-JCC modules rebuild them from one core channel
each; there the waveform SNR of the channels the modules make is pinned as it comes, a
decorrelated part having none.

The frame-rate legs (phase E5) encode music and speech in stereo and music in 5.1 at the other
frame rates of Part 1 Table 83 and at index 13, in the same run, and hold each to the index-13
stream of the same source and rate on the log-spectral distance and MOS alone: at the other frame
rates the delay is a fraction of a sample off the output's grid, which SNR and the lag would read
as error. Their pins, FRAME_RATE_PINS, are how far above index 13's LSD and below its MOS each may
land: the first measurement plus 0.25 dB and less 0.05.

--gold DIR runs the race instead, locally: for each of phase G0's 2.0 legs, ASPX from 48 to 144
kbps and SIMPLE from 192 to 768, and its 5.1 legs from 96 to 768, ASPX_ACPL_3 at 96, ASPX_ACPL_2 at
128 and 144 and ASPX to 320 kbps, and G1's sweeps in the codec modes that carry A-SPX (phase E10,
RACE_G1_CONTENT), DEE's stream
(DIR/streams/<leg>/dee.ac4) and this encoder's stream of the same source (DIR/sources/<source>.wav)
at the same rate are both decoded and scored as above. The encoder's scores are checked against
RACE, and in the A-CPL legs against RACE_ACPL, pinned the same way, and its gaps to DEE's are
printed. The race's 5.1.4 legs are G0's music and tones and G1's film, speech, sweeps and
transients (the manifest's g1_legs) at each of DEE's 5.1.4 rates, 192 to 768 kbps, scored as the
immersive legs are, in full and in core decoding, against RACE_IMMERSIVE and
RACE_IMMERSIVE_EXTRA.

--only TEXT runs only the legs whose names contain TEXT.

--librempeg PATH also decodes every stream with librempeg's ffmpeg, run in WSL (the path is the
WSL one), and reports its scores against the source and how far its output is from the
decoder's; of a 5.1.4 stream, for each source channel the output channel that follows it most
closely, with their correlation and level. Nothing it measures is checked: planning/ac4.md,
decision 13.

--measure prints what every leg measures and checks nothing, for pinning a new leg.

# Phase D4's reading of pre-flattening (libs/ac4/ERRATA.md, "Pre-flattening's direction") moved

# streams of the same legs, both decoded by the decoder of phase D4. In the ASPX legs, ViSQOL is
# within 0.03 of DEE's or above it from 64 kbps up (music +0.05 at 64 and +0.04 at 96), and 0.06
# and 0.09 under it on music and speech at 48 kbps. Below the crossover the encoder's SNR is 1.4 to
# 3.6 dB under DEE's at 48 and 64 kbps and on music at 96, whose bits go where ViSQOL marks the
# noise, and 0.6 to 8.2 dB over it on speech at 96 and from 128. The A-SPX tiles land within 0.35
# dB of DEE's distance from the source's energy, or closer (music at 64 kbps: 2.3 dB against 5.7).
# D4's pre-flattening raised both encoders' speech at 48 kbps, DEE's by 0.32 and this one's by
# 0.21, where under D3's this one led by 0.02. In the SIMPLE legs, from 192 kbps, the encoder is
# E1's: 5.6 dB over DEE's SNR on music at 192 kbps, 14.9 on speech and 32 on the tones, its
# log-spectral distance lower on each, and ViSQOL within 0.01 of DEE's 4.70 to 4.73.
# From 256 kbps DEE's audio stops changing and the encoder's goes on improving, to 74 dB on music
# at 768 kbps, where the QMF banks' reconstruction bounds it.
# The 5.1 legs, measured 2026-09-25 with the encoder of phase E3, ASPX to 320 kbps and SIMPLE
# from 384 as DEE's are. Below the crossover the encoder's SNR is 7.3 to 11.6 dB under DEE's at
# 192 kbps and 1.9 to 3.7 under at 256: DEE keeps 21 to 27 dB below 2 kHz and lets the band from
# 8 kHz fall to 3 dB and under, where this encoder spreads its noise across the band. From 288
# kbps it is within 1.6 dB of DEE's, and from 320 over it: 3.2 to 3.8 dB at 384 and 15 to 19 at
# 768. ViSQOL is at or above DEE's at 192 and 256 kbps; from 288 it is up to 0.05 under on film
# and 0.02 on music, and within 0.01 at 768. The log-spectral distance is lower on every leg, the
# A-SPX tiles land within 0.07 dB of DEE's distance from the source's energy or closer, and the
# LFE, which DEE low-passes, comes back 15 to 29 dB over its noise by the rate.
# The sweeps at the end (G1's, RACE_G1_CONTENT), measured 2026-09-29 with the encoder of phase E10,
# whose noise floors for a group the patch cannot fill are what they hold: DEE's ViSQOL on the 2.0
# sweeps is 4.22 to 4.54 and 4.17 to 4.27 on the 5.1 ones (A-CPL 4.44, 4.45), and this encoder's is
# 0.15 to 0.28 over it at 2.0 (0.04 under at 48 kbps before the floors), 0.05 to 0.48 over at 5.1
# (0.03 to 0.21 over before, its tiles 2 to 11 dB further from the source's energy than DEE's), the
# tiles now 4 to 7 dB nearer to it than DEE's. The log-spectral distance is 0.55, 0.79 and 1.14 dB
# over DEE's in 2.0 at 48, 64 and 96 kbps (0.93 over before at 96) and 0.55 to 2.7 dB under it
# elsewhere: the noise the floors send fills bands where the source holds one tone.

# The race's A-CPL legs, 5.1 at 96, 128 and 144 kbps, pinned as ACPL_FLOORS are. Measured 2026-09-25
# with the encoder of phase E4, both streams decoded by the decoder of phase D5. Against DEE's, the
# per-band level difference lands 0.02 to 0.13 dB nearer the source's on music and film, the
# correlation within 0.007 of DEE's distance, and the log-spectral distance is lower on every leg;
# ViSQOL is 0.01 to 0.06 above DEE's, except on film at 128 kbps, 0.12 under, where the coded C's
# band below 2 kHz trails DEE's by 9.5 dB of SNR. On the tones the routing margin is 1.2 dB (at 96)
# and 2.9 dB over DEE's. The coded downmixes' SNR trails DEE's by 3.4 to 9.5 dB, the E3 rate loop's
# spread of noise across the band. Phase E6 gave every presentation a presentation_id, as DEE's
# streams and CMAF have it: three bits of the table of contents that take a byte of the audio from
# each frame at 128 kbps, which moved film's coded C from 21.4 to 20.2 dB and its other downmixes by
# 0.1 to 0.4 dB, ViSQOL unchanged; its C floor is pinned again from there. The three sweep legs are
# G1's (RACE_G1_CONTENT), measured 2026-09-29 with the encoder of phase E10; the RACE comment says
# how they stand against DEE's.

# The race's 5.1.4 legs: G0's music and tones and G1's film, speech, sweeps and transients (the
# gold manifest's g1_legs), at each of DEE's 5.1.4 rates, in IMMERSIVE_FLOORS' and
# IMMERSIVE_EXTRA's forms. Measured 2026-09-26 with the encoder of phase E8 and the decoder of
# phase D9, both encoders' streams in the codec mode DEE's take at the rate, ASPX_ACPL_2 to 448
# kbps, ASPX_SCPL at 512 and SCPL at 768. On music, film and speech the encoder's SNR below the
# lowest crossover is 0.1 to 10.5 dB under DEE's from 192 to 320 kbps (most at 256, where the
# waveform codes to 10.5 kHz), within 1.4 dB of it or over it at 384 and 512, and 0.6 to 14 dB
# over it at 448 and 768: as E3 found in 5.1, DEE keeps its SNR high at low frequencies and lets
# the top of the band go, where this encoder spreads its noise by its masking thresholds. ViSQOL
# is up to 0.08 over DEE's from 192 to 384 kbps and at most 0.035 under it on any of these legs,
# in core decoding as in full (the two within 0.02 of each other). The log-spectral distance is
# lower on all but six of the 24 legs (0.07 to 0.31 dB higher on those), the A-SPX tiles land
# within 0.2 dB of DEE's distance from the source's energy or closer, and A-CPL's top pairs 0.06
# to 0.16 dB closer to the source's level difference than DEE's and 0.04 to 0.06 closer in
# correlation. The tones come back 25 to 50 dB over DEE's SNR, the transients 8 to 12 dB. The
# sweeps' waveform is 31 to 40 dB over DEE's. The sweeps' entries were measured again 2026-09-29
# with the encoder of phase E10. With E8's, A-SPX's patch held nothing to copy while a sweep was
# above the crossover and the encoder sent no noise floor there, the decoder's noise being a share
# of the envelope whatever the patch holds (Part 1 Pseudocodes 94 and 95): the band came back 30
# to 68 dB under the sweep's energy where DEE's floors, 2^-1 to 2^-11, bring it to 15 to 17 dB
# under, the tiles landed 4 to 14 dB further from the source's energy than DEE's, and ViSQOL 0.03
# to 0.18 under DEE's from 256 to 512 kbps. With the floors of libs/ac4/ERRATA.md's "A noise
# floor for a group whose patch holds nothing" the tiles land 3.5 to 5.7 dB nearer than DEE's,
# ViSQOL is 0.13 to 0.66 over DEE's in full decoding and 0.05 to 0.65 in core decoding at every
# A-SPX rate, and the log-spectral distance, still 0.8 to 1.3 dB under DEE's, is 0.4 to 0.7 dB
# higher than E8's pins had it (the noise fills bands where the source holds one tone), the
# SNR floors unchanged but for 0.1 dB in a channel or two at 256 to 320 kbps.
