"""Check the mixes of forge's AC-4 presentations against Part 1's and Part 2's formulas.

For each presentation of several substreams in the multiplexed streams under
tests/golden/ac4/presentations/ (planning/ac4.md, phase D7; tests/ac4/decoder/ac4dec_mux.hpp builds
them from DEE's tone legs and the encoder's tone streams), this decodes the presentation with
`forge decode presentation-id=`, and each of its substreams alone through the single-group
presentations the streams also carry, and holds the mix to the matrix the texts give. The
stream's own values come from `forge decode ... syntax-trace=` and its table of contents from the
Python reference parser (tools/references/ac4_parse.py, ac4_presentations.py):

  mix      ETSI TS 103 190-2 clauses 4.8.3.15 to 4.8.4 and TS 103 190-1 clause 6.2.16: the main
           or music and effects substream after its dialogue enhancement, by its group's gain
           (Part 2 Table 70, -0.25 dB a step) and, with associated audio, scale_main on every
           channel, scale_main_front on L and R and scale_main_centre on C (-0.3 dB a step); the
           dialogue by its group's gain, g_dialog up to g_dialog_max ((1 + dialog_max_gain) x 3
           dB, 0 dB where none is sent) and, with associated audio, the same scales on its own
           channels; the associated audio by its group's gain and g_assoc, which a premixed
           service does not take; a mono substream panned by pan_dialog or pan_associated (1.5
           degrees a step, 0 where none is sent), the rest channel to channel; summed, not
           divided by the number of substreams (src/ac4/ERRATA.md, "The mixer's sum"). The
           pan puts L at 330 degrees, C at 0 and R at 30 (Part 1 clause 4.3.12.4.9 and Table
           216), the surrounds at Table D.1's 110 degrees either side, and shares a signal
           linearly between the two channels either side of its angle, which Table 216's 0.5 and
           0.5 at 0 degrees between L and R fixes.
  hybrid   Part 1 clauses 5.7.8.7 to 5.7.8.9, at dialogue-enhancement=6: the main substream's
           processed channels by (1 - alpha_c) g of the parametric method and the dialogue
           enhancement substream's waveform by alpha_c g, g = 10^(G/20) - 1 with G capped at
           G_max; the waveform's channels go to the processed channels in order with the channel
           independent method, halved into L and R for the Mid, and by r with the cross-channel
           method; and the result takes the main substream's gains.
  level    Part 2 clause 4.8.5.2: a version 1 presentation takes its presentation substream's
           dialnorm; a version 0 one takes Table 16's substream's (the dialogue's in
           configurations 0 and 3, the main one's otherwise), and levels its associated audio
           to it from the associated substream's own by 2^((dialnorm - own) / 6) (Part 1 clause
           6.2.16.0, in dB2 as the output level gain is). At output-level=-31 (drcmode=off) each
           presentation goes to that level from its dialnorm, 2^((Lout - dialnorm) / 6).

Each output channel is fitted, by least squares over the steady frames, on every channel of the
substreams decoded alone, each carrying tones of its own: every coefficient must equal the
formula's to 0.01 dB (one tone per substream and channel), those the formula makes 0 must be 60
dB under, and what the formula leaves of the output must be 80 dB under it. The mixes run at
g_dialog and g_assoc of 0 dB, at -6 and -10 dB, and at +9 dB, which g_dialog_max caps, as coded;
and at 0 dB at the output level, against the substreams alone at the same level.
