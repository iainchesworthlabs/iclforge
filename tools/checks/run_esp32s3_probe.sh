# and sends the decoder's allocations of 512 bytes and more there (planning/ac4.md, D14c).
# QEMU emulates that PSRAM. It gates what the other two directions gate, with the AC-4
# probe's own ceilings, and two things more: every fixture's PCM hash against the pins the
# Cortex-M3 leg and the host are held to (testdata/ac4-probe-pcm-hashes.json, decision
# 26), and the internal RAM each fixture took at its worst moment, which is what Wi-Fi and
# lwIP share with the decoder on a board.
#
# WHAT THIS GATES, and what it deliberately does not:
#
#   - The probe's own verdict. Decoding: every fixture in
#     testdata/baremetal/fixture.hpp decoded, every channel's level checked.
#     Encoding: six frames of synthesised 5.1 through each of the two encoders,
#     byte count and FNV-1a hash checked against firmware/baremetal/encode_fixture.hpp.
#     Either way, result=pass - a failure means the codec is wrong on Xtensa.
#   - Internal SRAM. The ESP32-S3 has 341,760 bytes of DIRAM and this profile
#     has to fit its static data AND its peak heap inside it. That is the
#     constraint the port actually ran into - it failed with
#     `out_of_memory bytes=86016` until the decode path moved to float32 - so
#     the headroom between the two is what is worth holding.
#   - Allocation churn, the same gap the ARM leg gates.
#
# NOT speed. QEMU is not a cycle-accurate emulator and reports a CPU clock that
# disagrees with its own boot log; the probe's us_per_frame lines are printed
# for shape and are not evidence of anything. The real-time answer needs
# hardware - see docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md.

# Bytes. Measured values with headroom, not aspirations; a change that pushes
# past one should stop here and be explained rather than land silently.
#
# DIRAM is the interesting one. The ESP32-S3's internal SRAM is 341,760 bytes
# and the linked app currently uses 134,804 of it. That leaves 206,956 by the
# linker's estimate, though the allocator reports 280,792 free at runtime,
# against a 236,391-byte peak heap. The ceiling is on what the IMAGE uses,
# because that is what squeezes the heap: every byte of static data here is a
# byte the decode cannot allocate.
#
# Not 179,064: that is what the peak was BEFORE the probe reconstructed Atmos
# objects, and docs/performance-trend.md quotes it as the start of the sequence
# that ends at today's number rather than as today's number.
: "${ICLFORGE_ESP32S3_MAX_DIRAM_BYTES:=170000}"
# 245,000, raised from 200,000 when the probe started reconstructing Atmos
# objects rather than only decoding their bed. oba::joc::reconstruct now runs on
# this target, which it could not before: 449,826 bytes of peak as found,
# 233,546 after Domain::kMdctBand, a float32 ReconstructionState, per-object
# scratches sized to the stream, and handing back the enhanced-coupling scratch
# between decodes. docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md has what each was worth.
#
# 245,000 sits below the 280,792 bytes the allocator reports free, not at it: a
# ceiling at the hardware limit fails at the same moment the part does, which is
# too late to be a warning. This leaves 35,792 bytes in which CI goes red while
# a board would still be running, and 11,454 of margin over the measurement.
#
# The margin matters more here than the arithmetic suggests. This part's heap is
# REGIONED - 280,792 free but a largest block of 217,088 - so a total-free figure
# is not an allocation budget, and a peak that packs into a flat newlib heap on
# the arm-none-eabi leg can still fail here. It did: at 267,754, before the
# scratch was released, this leg died on a 6,144-byte request.

# until the 60 allocations per frame behind that exemption turned out to be two
# std::vector<double> in the reconstruction loop rather than anything §E3.5
# asks for; it now measures 12, level with plain eac3. See
# run_baremetal_probe.sh's own copy of this ceiling for the fixture-by-fixture
# numbers - this leg reports every one of them identically, which is the check
# that section is really there for.

# Bytes still live when the probe finishes, after every decoder it made has been

# to enhanced coupling's spectrum scratch, the one thread_local the library
# still declares. (24 while its per-bin angle buffer was a second one; that is
# a stack array now.)
#
# It was 34,232 until the probe started calling iclforge::ac3::eac3::release_ecpl_scratch()
# between fixtures. That difference was enhanced coupling's 32,768-byte spectrum
# scratch (23,552 in its float form) and the 1,440-byte bin-angle vector, which
# were thread_local and so resident for the life of a task that never exits. Not a leak - bounded,
# paid once, and the point of caching them - but enough to decide whether
# something else fits: object reconstruction did not, on an ESP32-S3, whenever
# it ran after an enhanced-coupling decode.
#
# 1,024 against a measured 12 is deliberately tight. There is nothing here that
# grows a little; either the scratch is being handed back or it is not, and the
# difference is five figures. A ceiling with room for half of it would report
# nothing useful.

# 40,960 bytes after an overflow that surfaced as a LoadProhibited panic on the
# OTHER core - i.e. the failure mode here is not a clean error, it is corruption
# somewhere unrelated. This floor is what turns "we picked a stack size and
# hoped" into a number that has to keep holding - and the decode margin is the
# one to watch: it was 14,000 free before object reconstruction ran on this
# target, then 11,280, then PR #698 (legacy-core downmix levels: bsid/
# cmixlev/surmixlev/alternate_bsi added to DecodedSubstream/DecodedAccessUnit)
# measured it down to 8,096 - 96 bytes under this floor - which is why the
# stack size above is 40,960 rather than the original 32,768. It read 16,064
# free of the 40,960 after that, and 19,344 once the decoder built its results

# --- and the AC-4 direction's --------------------------------------------------
# Plain assignments, for the reason the encode block gives. Measured 2026-10-03 under QEMU
# (planning/ac4.md, D14c), sdkconfig.ac4 with allocations of 512 bytes and more in PSRAM:
#
#   - the image: 51,469 bytes of DIRAM, half the AC-3 and E-AC-3 decode image's, since
#     iclforge::ac3's decoders are not linked;
#   - heap.peak_bytes counts both regions and is the Cortex-M3 leg's to the byte (1,494,319
#     at the 5.1.4 fixture since D14f; 1,800,312 before it), so it takes that leg's ceiling for
#     that fixture, 1,680,000, and the churn and retained bytes too;
#   - the internal RAM each fixture took at its worst (<fixture>.esp32s3.internal_peak_bytes):
#     3,188 to 5,032 bytes at 2.0, 8,612 and 12,012 at 5.1, 14,140 at 5.1.4. Under ESP-IDF's
#     default limit of 16 KB the same fixtures took 247,608 to 263,756 at 2.0 and left 1.3 to
#     2.6 KB of 347,051 free at 5.1 and 5.1.4, which is why the limit is 512 here;
#   - the stack a decode used, read by painting: 21,440 to 21,600 bytes (19,480 on the
#     Cortex-M3, whose frames are smaller); the main task, at 49,152, kept 10,736 free with
#     the probe's 36,864-byte painted window under its frame.
#
# The internal figure is the sum of each internal heap region's own low point over the
# decode, so it is at most what was in use at once. 2.0's ceiling is the tightest (decision 29
# planned 2.0 in internal RAM; the owner put the state in PSRAM on 2026-10-03): a decode that
# starts keeping its state in internal RAM shows here before a board's Wi-Fi does.

# --- what the ALLOCATOR has, as opposed to what the linker estimated -------
# `idf.py size` prints a DIRAM "remain" figure and it is a static estimate: it
# was 207,084 against the 280,792 the allocator actually reports, 73,708 bytes
# pessimistic. Quote the runtime numbers, not that one.
#
# The largest contiguous block is the one that decides whether a big allocation
# SUCCEEDS, and it is not a refinement of the total. Measured here it falls from
# 217,088 before the decode to 116,736 after, while the total only falls 35,544 -
# so a single 147,504-byte oba::joc::ReconstructionState would already be
# unallocatable after any other decode, on contiguity alone and whatever the
# budget says. The probe cannot see this: its own hooks count bytes, not runs.
