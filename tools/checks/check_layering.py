"""Fail when a library under libs/ includes a header its row of the dependency table forbids.

The libraries under libs/ form a graph, and the graph has no cycle today. What keeps it that way
is nothing but the habit of the people editing it, and a habit does not survive the next
library: the day a codec-blind library includes a codec's header, that codec can no longer be
left out of a build that does not want it. This check makes the direction data.
tools/checks/layering.json lists every library and the libraries it may include from; this script
resolves every #include of every C/C++ file under libs/ the way the compiler does (relative to the
including file, then by the spelling a header is reached by) and reports each include that
crosses from one library into another the table does not allow. Stdlib-only, run from
_static.yml's static job and runnable the same way locally:

    python3 tools/checks/check_layering.py [--root <repo>] [--table <json>] [--edges]

What counts as a library is the second component of a path under libs/: libs/<library>/. A library's
own tests/ and fuzz/ directories sit beside its code (planning/monorepo.md); they consume libraries
and are not library code, so they are not read here, as they were not while they were outside
src/. While the
tree was being re-laid out (planning/layout.md) the table had a "layout" section with two
adjustments, a directory that holds several libraries split by path rules, first match wins, and a
directory renamed for the library it holds; the script still reads such a section, and a table
without one gives the plain rule.

Four things fail the check, each with a line that names the file and the line of the include:

  - an include that crosses into a library the table does not list for the includer;
  - a file in a library the table does not know (add the row, and say what it may include);
  - a table that has a cycle, or names a library nothing is filed under;
  - a *known debt* that no longer exists (below).

Known debts. A cut that removes an include the table forbids lands as its own change, and the
include is there until it does. Each such include is listed in a file of
tools/checks/layering_debt/ (one file per cut, so that two cuts landing together never edit the
same lines): a line is `<path of the including file> <the spelling it includes>`, blank lines
and # comments are ignored. A listed include is reported as known and does not fail. A listed
include that is no longer in the tree fails, which is what makes the change that removes it
delete its line, and the one that removes a cut's last include delete the file. With the cuts
landed no file is left, and the directory's README.md keeps it in the tree (git has no empty
directory) and says how a debt is listed.

`--edges` prints the include edges between libraries with their counts and stops, which is how a
table row is written in the first place; `--debt-lines` prints every include the table forbids in
the form a debt file takes, which is how a cut's file is written.
