"""Provision hearth_sink over Improv Wi-Fi under QEMU, and hold it to its answers.

planning/hearth-reference-player.md, B2. A board with no network listens for
Improv Wi-Fi (https://www.improv-wifi.com/serial/) on its console, and a
client there gives it an SSID and a passphrase:
firmware/hearth-sink/main/provision.cpp answers, in the
packet format of firmware/esp-idf/iclforge/include/iclforge/improv.hpp. QEMU has no
radio, so tools/checks/run_improv_qemu.sh boots two images, one for each of
these scenarios:

  late-network   The Sendspin player on QEMU's Ethernet (sdkconfig.ci-sendspin),
                 started with its link down. The boot's network_up() gives up
                 after 30 s and the board listens. This sends it a network and
                 brings the link up while the board waits for an address. The
                 board must answer as a client expects: error none, its page's
                 URL, provisioned. Then it must start what boot would have
                 started: mDNS, the Sendspin player and the player's console
                 commands. With --control it then renames the board over the
                 REST surface and asks device_info for the name back, and it
                 types a console command, whose Enter reaches the board as the
                 CR a terminal sends. The capture goes on while the runner
                 plays to the player, until QEMU exits. Before #741 the board
                 aborted in that second network_up() and restarted.

                 The SSID it sends is 13 bytes and the name it stores is 10
                 characters, so that the length byte in front of each is a CR
                 one way and an LF the other: a console that converts line
                 endings (ESP-IDF's default, and what sdkconfig.defaults turns
                 off) corrupts those packets, and this fails when it does.
  unprovisioned  The WiFi build with nothing stored and nothing built in
                 (sdkconfig.ci-wifi). It must boot with its control surface up,
                 listen, and answer current_state (ready) and device_info. It is
                 never sent a network: esp_wifi_start() does not return under
                 QEMU. Before #741 this build restarted in a loop on an lwIP
                 assertion.

The caller starts QEMU with -S, with its monitor and its console on TCP
servers (-monitor tcp:HOST:PORT,server=on,wait=off, and the same for
-serial). This connects to both before the part runs, then starts it, and
writes the console to --capture as it arrives. The capture holds the lines
the part printed, and each Improv packet it sent on a line of its own
("[improv] current_state ready"); tools/checks/check_esp_console.py reads it
afterwards. A monitor command is sent only once the "(qemu)" prompt is in:
QEMU drops one sent before it.

Once the scenario's checks have passed, this creates --ready, if given. It
then goes on capturing until QEMU closes the console or --hold seconds pass.
A check that fails prints one GitHub ::error:: annotation and ends the run.
A reset or panic output ends it too, a few seconds later, so that the
capture has the backtrace. Exit status 0 when every check passed, 1 when one
failed, 2 for a usage error.

  python3 tools/checks/improv_qemu.py late-network --serial 127.0.0.1:15571 \\
      --monitor 127.0.0.1:15572 --capture qemu-improv.txt --ready improv.ready
