"""Check the gains of forge's AC-4 output processing on DEE's and the encoder's streams against
Part 1's formulas and Part 2's channel renderer.

For each leg the decoder turns into PCM, at every frame rate, this decodes the stream as coded and
again with an output option, and holds the second decode to the first through the formula the option
applies, with the stream's own values read from `forge decode ... syntax-trace=` (planning/ac4.md,
phase D6):

  level    output-level=-31, -24 and -17 with drcmode=off: every channel is the coded output times
           2^((Lout - dialnorm) / 6) (ETSI TS 103 190-1 clause 5.7.9.3.3), dialnorm being
           -dialnorm_bits / 4 dBFS, to 0.01 dB, and nothing else: what the gain leaves is 100 dB
           under the output.
  downmix  a 5.1 leg's channels=2 (the stream's preferred method), downmix=loro, ltrt and mono: the
           output is clause 6.2.17's matrix with the stream's values applied to the coded output,
           which is to say Table 218's Lo/Ro or Lt/Rt, the latter in its Pro Logic II form (+1.8 and
           -3.2 dB) where the stream prefers that, with Tables 149 and 149a's centre and surround
           gains, the LFE at 5.5 - lfe_mixgain dB when the stream sends lfe_mixgain, the stream's
           loudness correction of (15 - x) / 2 dB2, and for mono L + R. What the matrix leaves is 80
           dB under the output: the downmix works in the QMF domain before the synthesis bank, which
           is linear, so the two differ only in the output's rounding.
  render   a 5.1.4 leg's immersive element, in full decoding speakers=5.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.4, 7.1,
           7.1.2 and 7.1.4, in core decoding speakers=5.1 (and 5.1.2 and 7.1.4, which are its
           as-coded 5.X.2), and in both channels=2, downmix=loro, ltrt and mono: the output is
           Part 2's channel renderer (ETSI TS 103 190-2 clause 5.10.2) applied to the coded
           output, with the custom downmix gains the stream sends (Tables 129 and 130, read from
           the trace with the codes cdmx_parameters() assigns rather than reads) and the output's
           loudness correction where it downmixes: in full decoding Tables 38 to 43 from the
           source's configuration, in core decoding Table 46 over the inverse of Table 45, which
           the as-coded output took, and for two channels and one Table 218 after 5.X.0 with the
           stereo correction alone, the core's in core decoding (libs/ac4/ERRATA.md, "The
           channel renderer"). Every channel with signal to 0.01 dB, and what the matrix leaves
           80 dB under the output.

  dialogue enhancement
           on the encoder's streams (--encoder), dialogue-enhancement=3, 6 and 12: each channel
           the stream marks as carrying dialogue alone, whose parameters are 1 in every band, is
           the coded output raised by the gain or the stream's cap where that is lower (clause
           5.7.8, 1 + g p with g = 10^(G / 20) - 1), with the Mid method both of a pair carrying
           the same tone; the other channels are the coded output. To 0.01 dB, and what the gain
           leaves is 80 dB under the output.

All skip the first three frames, where the stream's values have not yet reached the QMF domain,
and stop three frames before the first frame whose values differ from the first frame's: DEE's
immersive stereo at 24 and 25 fps sends a dialnorm of -24 dBFS in its last frame. DRC's curves and
dialogue enhancement's gains are held on known input by libs/ac4/tests/decoder/test_drc.cpp and
test_de.cpp; this script reads the gains from the stream, as those tests cannot.

The committed legs (tests/golden/external-baseline/) are checked by default. --gold DIR checks
phase G0's local gold set in DIR (DIR/streams/<leg>/dee.ac4, DIR/gold-manifest.json), which never
runs in CI, and with --g1 the G1 legs G1_LEGS names besides. --encoder checks streams
`forge ac4-encode` writes from tones here, a leg for each metadata option the output processing
reads (ENCODER_LEGS), at several frame rates (planning/ac4.md, phase E5), and 5.1.4 in each of the
encoder's immersive codec modes, the experimental ASPX_AJCC among them, with each height downmix,
whose renders are held to Part 2's channel renderer with the custom downmix data the stream sends
(phase E8).

--engine RENDER decodes through Hearth's engine instead (planning/ac4.md, phase I2): RENDER is
hearth-render (apps/hearth/render), which plays a stream through the player, session and stream
decoder the window uses, and each of forge's options above becomes the Decoder page's setting for
it (engine_settings()). The coded output is the engine's too, on a layout of the stream's own
channels in forge's order; the stream's values still come from forge's syntax trace, and the
formulas and tolerances are the same.
