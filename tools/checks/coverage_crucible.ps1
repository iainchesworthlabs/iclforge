# Line and branch coverage for Crucible (apps/crucible), the
# Windows counterpart of coverage_report.sh: runs the "crucible" (Catch2)
# and "crucible-ui" (Qt Quick Test) ctest labels of a config-windows-llvm-coverage
# build under LLVM_PROFILE_FILE, merges the profiles, and prints llvm-cov's
# per-file report over apps/crucible. Also writes an HTML report next to the
# build for browsing the uncovered lines.
#
# -Labels is a ctest label regex (ctest -L), and so is the coverage preset's
# filter in CMakePresets.json (test-windows-llvm-coverage). Both default to
# '^crucible(-ui)?$', naming the two labels this build carries: the Catch2
# engine cases and the Qt Quick suites (apps/crucible/ui/tests/CMakeLists.txt
# sets the second). Spelling both out keeps the Qt Quick half in the figure
# however the regex is read - a bare 'crucible' only reaches 'crucible-ui'
# because ctest matches a label anywhere in the string, and an anchored
# reading of the same filter would drop five suites out of the number without
# saying so.
#

#   cmake --build --preset build-windows-llvm-coverage

#
# The gate is the same shape coverage_report.sh gives the library: a table of
# floors, one row per component with a line percentage and a branch
# percentage, every figure reported before the script exits so the log shows
# the whole picture rather than only the first miss. One row, because
# apps/crucible IS the component - it sits beside libs/ac3 and apps/forge/cli/src,
# not as a tree of components (planning/recasting.md). The
# per-file breakdown printed under it is reported and never gated, the way
# apps/forge/cli/src's per-command breakdown is: one floor on the aggregate is what
# stops a regression, and a floor per file would be twenty-five numbers to
# re-calibrate every time a class moves.
#
# A failing ctest also fails this script. It did not, and a green run that
# reported the coverage of a suite which had gone red would have been worth
# nothing - the whole point of a floor.
#
# The measured figures and what is thin, with reasons, are in
# docs/crucible/design/promotion.md beside the rest of the promotion's phase record;
# docs/platforms/windows-demo.md keeps the history the product grew from.

# The gate.
#
# The numbers come from llvm-cov's own JSON export rather than from scraping
# the table printed above: `llvm-cov report`'s column layout is meant for a
# person to read and has changed between LLVM releases, while the export
# carries a version and a stable shape. One export, not one per row - it
# carries `totals` for the whole filter and a `files` entry per source file,
# which is both the gated figure and the breakdown under it.
#
# Component floors, one row per component: <path> <line%> <branch%>, the
# shape tools/checks/coverage_report.sh uses for src/* and apps/forge/cli/src.
#
# Calibrated 2026-09-06 against the first CI run of this gate, on the
# windows-llvm leg it runs on: 68.5% of lines (1,401 of 4,442 missed) and
# 55.1% of branches, over the `crucible` and `crucible-ui` labels.
#
# The number measured on the development workstation the day before was 76.3%
# and 62.2%, and the eight points between them are not drift. They are the
# Windows platform seams, which cover far more on a machine with a real audio
# environment than on a headless runner: session_monitor.cpp read 85.0% of
# lines here and 34.0% there, default_device.cpp 45.8% and 24.7%,
# library_devices.cpp 64.3% and 11.9%. Those files enumerate endpoints, walk
# audio sessions and ask the shell about windows; a runner with no sound
# device and no desktop takes the early return in each. The workstation figure
# was the more flattering of two honest measurements, and the gate has to hold
# on the machine that runs it.
#
# So the floors are set from the CI reading, about a point and a half under
# it. That margin is deliberately close: this exists to hold today's state,
# not to demand tests nobody has written. Raise it as the suite grows rather
# than leaving headroom in place indefinitely - the same instruction
# coverage_report.sh's own table carries.
#
# What can still move this number is the kit. Qt Quick 3D and Qt SVG are both
# optional (apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt), and a build without Quick3D leaves
# Room3DView.qml and its controller path out of the denominator. Both were
# present on the run this was calibrated against; if the margin ever proves
# too tight, check that before lowering anything.
