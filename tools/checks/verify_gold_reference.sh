# The gold-reference correctness gate: proves forge's own decoder agrees
# with an independent decoder (FFmpeg) on the same encoded bitstream, using a
# fixed, checked-in 5.1 WAV (tests/golden/audio/reference_51.wav - see
# tools/generators/gen_gold_reference_wav.py) as the input material. This is
# the original validation pyramid's L3 ("FFmpeg oracle, every commit"; the
# design now lives in docs/verification.md as "FFmpeg as an external oracle")
# plus a lightweight L4 (SNR vs. FFmpeg's own decode) - designed from the
# start, but never wired into any CI leg until now. tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh
# already exercises "does every layout/tool/metadata combination run without
# crashing"; this is the complementary "is the audio actually right" check that
# script deliberately does not attempt.

# 55, not some more conservative-looking round number: this gate compares two
# decodes of the *same* bitstream (FFmpeg vs. forge's own decoder), so absent
# a real bug it should sit near the floating-point noise floor forever, not
# vary the way a lossy-vs-original comparison (see tools/ci/quality_race.py's
# very different, much lower floors) legitimately does. Every real run
# recorded in quality-history (docs/quality-trend.md) to date has landed
# 61.8-67.9 dB, with the ~6 dB floor-to-floor spread splitting the legs
# strictly by ARCHITECTURE: every arm64 leg lands ~6.02 dB below every x86-64
# leg. Not by OS and not by compiler - macos-llvm (arm64) sits with the arm64
# group while macos-llvm-x64 sits with the x86 group, which is what rules out
# the "macOS libm" and "arm64 and macOS" readings earlier versions of this
# comment carried.
#
# cross-platform bitstream reproducibility resolved what it is: one bit of arithmetic difference, visible
# only where the comparison is ALREADY rounding-dominated. Sorting all 52
# (check, channel) pairs by their x86 SNR shows a step, not a gradient -
# every pair below 67 dB has an arm64 delta of 0.00-0.11 dB, every pair above
# it has 5.85-6.05 dB. A systematic exponent error would be level-independent
# and split every channel equally; this only appears once the two decoders
# agree closely enough that arithmetic is all that is left to disagree about.
# See docs/verification.md's "Why arm64 and x86-64 disagree". Not
# commit-to-commit noise either way, which has stayed inside 0.02-0.08 dB.
# 55 leaves the lowest-scoring legs' own ~61.8 dB floor about 7 dB of
# headroom (comfortably above that noise) while catching a regression more
# than an order of magnitude smaller than the previous 30 dB floor ever
# could.
MIN_SNR_DB="${MIN_SNR_DB:-55}"

# --- Per-channel floors -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Every floor below is a VECTOR, one entry per channel in WAV order
# (L R C LFE Ls Rs for the 5.1 fixtures, L R for the stereo ones), because one
# floor across six channels is not one gate: it is one gate on the worst
# channel and dead slack on the other five.
#
# The surrounds of a 5.1 fixture sit far below the front channels by
# construction - the encoder spends fewer bits there, and §7.3.4 leaves dither
# VALUES decoder-defined, so two independently correct decoders diverge in the
# zero-bit bins by design (this is the same freedom the dither=off note further
# down exists for, except a third-party fixture's dithflag is not ours to turn
# off). A single floor therefore has to clear the surrounds, and on
# ext_ac3_51_448_dee that meant 22 dB - against a centre channel measuring
# 58.11 dB. The centre could have collapsed by 36 dB and this gate would still
# have gone green, which is precisely the per-channel syntax misread the
# external-baseline block below was added to catch (see its own list: the
# firstcplcos[ch] bug is per channel).
#
# Derivation, uniformly: floor = floor(min_observed - 1.0), where min_observed
# is that channel's lowest value across EVERY leg and EVERY commit recorded in
# the quality-history branch (9 legs, 57-74 commits, depending on the check).
#
# The 1.0 dB covers commit-to-commit noise and nothing else, because
# min_observed has already absorbed everything else. That is the correction
# cross-platform bitstream reproducibility produced, and it is worth stating because the first version of
# these vectors got it wrong: they used 6.02 dB, reasoning that a floor tighter
# than the arm64/x86 split would risk a new platform tripping it. But
# min_observed is a MINIMUM ACROSS LEGS, so wherever that split appears it is
# already the arm64 value - the low side of it. Subtracting the size of the
# split from a number that is already the bottom of the split counted the same
# margin twice and cost ~5 dB of sensitivity on every channel.
#
# What one leg's own number actually does between commits, measured over 520
# (check, leg, channel) series: median spread 0.000 dB, 495 of them under
# 0.5 dB. The 25 that are not are a single real step change on one check
# (eac3_cplbndstrce0, 2026-08-17, 25.42 -> 22.41, flat for the 63 commits
# since) rather than noise. 1.0 dB is more than ten times the largest genuine
# commit-to-commit movement on record (0.02-0.08 dB).
#
# A new leg landing below one of these floors is not a false alarm under this
# policy. It is platform behaviour nobody has reviewed, and stopping to look at
# it is the right outcome rather than something to pre-authorise with margin.
#
# One pair of floors is LOWER than the single floor it replaced:
# ext_ac3_51_448_dee's Ls/Rs, 22 -> 21. 22 was never derived for those channels
# - it was the one floor the whole fixture had to share and it happened to land
# 0.7 dB under them. Their four sibling channels gained 34-59 dB of gate in the
# same change, and the check went from catching only a total surround collapse
# to catching a 1 dB move in any channel.
#

# gate green:

# .github/workflows/_build.yml), which is what keeps a change to either fast
# path from silently taking its own oracle with it.
#
# Empty (the default) passes no mode token at all, so an ordinary run is

# This check gates six bitstreams from two real third-party encoders - Dolby
# Encoding Engine 6.5.4 and FFmpeg 8.0.1 - across three legs: ac3-51-448,
# eac3-51-256 and eac3-stereo-192, each in a dee/ and an ffmpeg/ copy (see
# tools/generators/gen_external_baseline.py, which produced them, and
# tests/golden/external-baseline/manifest.json for the versions). Six is what
# this check GATES, which is no longer what that directory HOLDS - legs have
# been added since for other consumers, and it is now nine leg directories and
# fifteen bitstreams. Adding one there does not gate it here: a leg is gated
# only once it appears in the loop below (or, for the sixth, in the
# check_against_source call after it) with per-channel floors derived for it,
# so count the entries rather than the directory. A seventh, DEE's transient
# pre-noise stream, has its own block after the sixth.
#
# They are the closest thing to conformance vectors this project can legally
# hold, and until now nothing in tests/ or src/ read them at all: their only
# consumer was tools/ci/quality_race.py, which decodes them with FFMPEG for
# the landscape spectrograms. So the streams were in the repository, and this
# project's own decoder had never been pointed at four of them.
#
# That was not a theoretical gap. Running this check for the first time found
# five separate Annex E decoder defects, all of them syntax this project's own
# encoder and FFmpeg's both happen never to produce and DEE's routinely does
# (each one is documented at its own site in
# libs/ac3/src/decoder/eac3_decoder.cpp):

#     in the frame;
#   - cplfgaincod and cplfsnroffst - the coupling channel's own fast gain and
#     fine SNR offset, which lead the per-channel lists in Table E1.4 - not
#     read at all;
#   - the cplbndstrce/spxbndstrce/ecplbndstrce default band-structure tables
#     applied in every block whose flag was clear, when §E2.3.3.7/.15/.18 use
#     the default only in the first block using that tool and the PREVIOUS
#     BLOCK's structure in every later one;
#   - firstcplcos[ch]/firstspxcos[ch]/firstcplleak treated as "blk == 0"
#     rather than the per-frame, per-channel state §E2.3.2.28-30 defines, so a
#     channel joining coupling part-way through a frame read a coordinate
#     exist bit that was never transmitted.
# Every one of them desynchronised the bit reader and made the whole frame
# unreadable, and none was reachable from anything this repository could
# encode for itself. That is the entire argument for this block.
#
# Floors are set the same way the cplbndstrce0 fixture's above was: from a
# measured number, with enough headroom that only a real defect trips them.
# They are much lower than MIN_SNR_DB because a real third-party encoder's
# choices - dither in bap == 0 bins above all, whose pseudo-random sequence is
# per-implementation - put two independently correct decoders far apart on the
# channels those choices land in, while the untouched channels stay in the
# 50-90 dB range.
#
# "the channels those choices land in" is the whole reason these floors are now
# per channel rather than one number per fixture. The dither divergence is
# concentrated in the surrounds; the front channels and the LFE stay in that
# 50-90 dB band. A single floor low enough for the former left the latter
# ungated by 30-70 dB - see "Per-channel floors" at the top of this file.

# The sixth. FFmpeg fails frame 0 of DEE's stereo E-AC-3 stream from cold -
# one frame of the 94, reporting "exponent 25 is out-of-range" and "error
# decoding the audio block" - and conceals it by repeating block 0 across
# blocks 1-4 rather than dropping it. Under this script's strict flags that
# one frame is a hard failure outright, and even without them the concealment
# is whole-file damage: FFmpeg's decode of this fixture scores 14.30 dB
# against the source WAV, where forge's scores 33.72 dB on the same
# alignment. So there is no usable FFmpeg oracle here, the same situation
# run_codec_matrix.sh already handles by skipping the FFmpeg check rather
# than tolerating its failure. The reference used instead is the WAV DEE was
# handed, which this repository has: 33.72 dB measured, and comparable to the
# 33.1 dB forge's decoder gets on FFmpeg's own encode of the same source at
# the same rate - two encoders' output landing within 0.6 dB of each other
# through one decoder is what says this decode is right and FFmpeg's is not.
# Floor 25 on the same measured-minus-8 basis as above, superseded in practice
# by the per-channel vector 32,33 (L R) passed below - derived, like every
# other vector here, as floor(min_observed - 1.0) from recorded history.
#
# manifest.json's 33.32 dB for this leg says "decoded_with": "ffmpeg" and is
# not in conflict with the 14.30 dB above: quality_race.py's score_fixed
# skips the first 0.2 s, which is exactly where the failing frame sits. See

# --- Transient pre-noise processing from a third party (§3.7) ---------------
# The first five seconds of a DEE stereo stream at 128 kbit/s that turns
# transient pre-noise processing on for every burst of its source - a second of
# silence, then decaying noise bursts - and places most of its transients in
# the frame after the one that signals them (tools/generators/
# gen_dee_tpn_fixture.py; leg.json beside the stream says where it came from).
# This decoder refused every such frame until a correction learned to wait for
# the frame its transient falls in.
#
# Two checks. Against the source DEE was given, as the stereo stream above is
# scored: noise bursts whose top band spectral extension synthesises keep every
# decoder within a few dB of it - 2.27 and 2.03 dB here, 2.46 and 2.25 through
# FFmpeg - so these floors, 1 dB, catch a lost channel or a shifted or dropped
# frame; where the corrections land is libs/ac3/tests/decoder/
# test_eac3_transient_prenoise.cpp's to check. And against FFmpeg's strict
# decode, which reads the stream cleanly but does not apply the tool: 4.38 and
# 4.65 dB, the spectral-extension noise each decoder synthesises for itself,
# floors 3 dB. Below 4 kHz, outside the corrected regions, the two agree to
# 37-40 dB.
#
# Both need a longer probe than compare_wav.py's 20,000 samples: the stream
# opens with a second of silence, where there is no lag to find.
