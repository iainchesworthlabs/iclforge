"""The includes that stop src/forge from splitting: those the dependency table forbids.

    violations.py --graph <include_graph.json> [--table tools/checks/projects.json] [--out <file>]

Reads the include graph include_graph.py wrote (every include of every C/C++ file, resolved) and
lists, per pair of libraries, the include directives that go from a library into one its row of the
table does not list. Libraries are what layoutdef.library_of names, so this is the list of cuts the
split needs, before they are made (layout-inventory.md section B.4). tools/checks/check_layering.py
is the check that keeps the count at zero afterwards; this script only reports it from a graph that
has already been built.
