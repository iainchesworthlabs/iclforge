"""Compare the exported symbols of the libraries before and after a change (two `symbols` records).

    export_diff.py --old <symbols-msvc.json> --new <symbols-msvc.json> [--map identity|l2]
                   [--rewrite cuts,names,idents,ac3ns,c2,c3] [--copies] [--limit 30]

`baseline.py record --only symbols` writes one record per build: for every shared library, the
names it exports, undecorated. This compares two of them. What a stage may change is named by the
options and nothing else passes.

  --map identity   libraries are the same files in both records (S1, S3, S4 once names have moved)
  --map l2         the libraries of S2: ac3forge.dll is compared with the union of the six it was
                   split into, and every other library with the file its output name becomes
                   (n1b_cmake.OUTPUT)
  --map c1|c2|c3   a consolidation stage's merges (planning/consolidation.md): the union of the
                   libraries merged into one, or divided between several (consoldef.SPLITS),
                   is compared with what they became
  --rewrite c2|c3  the names a consolidation stage moves to another namespace, rewritten first
                   (consoldef.renamed_namespace)
  --rewrite cuts   the types the seven cuts of S1 moved appear under their new qualified names
  --rewrite names  the namespace root is rewritten the way n1b_names.py rewrites it (S3)
  --rewrite idents the brand in a name is rewritten the way n1b_idents.py rewrites an identifier
                   (S4): the C API's `ac3forge_encoder_create` is `iclforge_encoder_create`, and
                   `sendspin::ac3forge` is `sendspin::player`
  --rewrite ac3ns  the AC-3 library's names nest under `iclforge::ac3` (S6): a name the table of
                   ac3ns_symbols.json lists is rewritten the way n1b_ac3ns.py rewrites a qualified
                   name, so `iclforge::FrameEncoder::encode(iclforge::Acmod)` is
                   `iclforge::ac3::FrameEncoder::encode(iclforge::ac3::Acmod)`, and
                   `iclforge::oba::Position`, which the objects library declares, is itself
  --copies         a name that leaves one library is not a difference when another library of
                   the new record exports it. A shared library that links the codec statically
                   re-exports the members it pulled in (admbridge.dll carried 278 copies of what
                   ac3forge.dll exports), and a change to what its headers include changes
                   which members it pulls.

Prints, per old library, the names only in the old set and only in the new one, and then the union
of every library's names, which no option excuses: what the libraries export together may change
only by the rewrites. Exit status 1 if any name differs. The proof for a split is that the new
union equals the old set plus the functions that now cross a library boundary (the prototype found
one: has_avx2()), which are listed for a person to accept.
