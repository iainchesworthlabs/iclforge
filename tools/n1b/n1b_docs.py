"""The pages, stage S5 of the plan: the documentation follows the new names, and every address
follows the new repository name.

    n1b_docs.py --root <worktree> --phase text|urls|words|all [--dry-run] [--report <file>]
                [--json <file>]

Three phases, each committed alone (`all` is the three in order).

`text` renames what the earlier stages left in living text. A page (every tracked `.md`,
`mkdocs.yml`, `overrides/`, the docs site's data and scripts under `docs/`, the generated snippets;
the history is not read) takes these rules in this order:

  the include spelling of every header that moved (`HEADER_MAP`: one decision per header, from the
  layout), the CMake aliases of the old single library (`ac3::forge` is `iclforge::ac3`: the table
  of n1b_cmake.py), the C++ qualifiers (`ac3::oba::X` is `iclforge::oba::X`, `ac4::X` is
  `iclforge::ac4::X`: the rules of n1b_names.py), the programs and their variables (the table of
  n1b_programs.py: `ac3cli` is `forge`, `AC3GUI_X` is `ICLFORGE_GUI_X`), and the brand (the
  decisions of n1b_idents.py, and those of n1b_programs.py for the names a program owns).

The one decision a page adds is the bare word. In code (a fenced block, a code span, a `<script>`,
a `<code>`, a data file) it is the identifier `iclforge`; in prose it is the family's name, "ICL
Forge"; "AC3Forge Hearth" and "AC3Forge Crucible" are "Hearth" and "Crucible". The text of a link
that is the bare word is prose, and a link's fragment is left alone here: a heading that changes
changes its anchor, and the link pass that ends the phase gives every link that names it the new
one, in every page that has one, the history included (a link is not text of the history).

Every other file that is not C, C++ or Rust (CMake, QML, JavaScript, Python, Kotlin, workflows, the
properties files, and the committed WASM fallbacks, which copy their sources) takes the first
three rules only: S3 renamed the qualifiers in the C and C++ sources and left these comments and
strings to this stage. A Rust file takes them in its comment lines, since `ac4::` is a path there.

`urls` moves the addresses in every tracked text file but the history: the repository
(`iainchesworthlabs/ac3forge`), the Pages site (`iainchesworthlabs.github.io/ac3forge`), the
Homebrew tap (`homebrew-ac3forge`), a reference to an issue (`ac3forge#796`), the directory a
clone makes and the path a runner makes from the repository's name. It keeps the URL of a release
that exists (`releases/download/v0.10.0-beta.1/...`, `archive/refs/tags/v0.10.0-beta.1.tar.gz`, a
link into a tag), the winget manifests' directory (a path in the tree), the SonarCloud project key
(it carries no slash), and the lines the hand-written commit writes (`HAND_LINES`: the guards that
test `github.repository`, and the constant the bump script reads).

`words` is the last of the three: the words of build and tool text that still name a library by the
name it had (`ac3adm`, `ac3iab`, `ac3audio`, `libac3iab.so`) or a CMake target of the old single
library by its raw name (`forge_shared`, `forge_c_static`). S2 renamed the targets and S3 the
namespaces, and each left a comment that says the word, or half of a pair
(`iclforge_ac3_static/forge_shared`). It reads the files of the third kind above (CMake, workflows,
shell, Python, the presets), never a page, a C or C++ file (their comments and strings keep these
words, and the census lists them) or a file name (`ac3iab.hpp`, `test_ac3iab.cpp`). A line that
tells a past event in the name of its time is left (`HISTORICAL_LINES`).

The history is `CHANGELOG.md`, `planning/`, `tests/golden`, the released winget manifests,
`.git-blame-ignore-revs` and this migration's scripts; no phase reads it. Three pages narrate
a tree that was named differently (`RECORD_PAGES`) and keep their names. A page line that
describes the rename itself is left (`HAND_PAGE_LINES`), and so is every line the hand-written
commits write about the past on purpose (`FORMER_NAME_LINES`, and `FORMER_NAME_FILES` for the page
that lists the old names); that is what lets a second run of the passes on the stage's last commit
change nothing. `--report` lists every decision, `--json` writes the rules, the counts and the
header table.
