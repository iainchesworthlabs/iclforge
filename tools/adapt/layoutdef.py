"""The candidate layouts as data: where every tracked path goes.

    L1  regroup    same library boundaries, consistent names, siblings under src/
    L2  peers      forge split into base, dsp, render, objects, iec61937 and ac3; flat src/; tests
    mirror src/ L3  libs       L2's libraries under libs/ with their tests, fuzz targets and
    benchmarks beside them

Each layout is a function old_path -> new_path (None when the file stays). For the header spellings
the rewrites need, spelling_of(path) gives the string a `#include` uses to reach a file, so
old_spelling -> new_spelling is derived from the move map, never written twice.

Used by layout_dryrun.py (the size estimates), by n1b_apply.py (the executor) and by n1b_cmake.py.

The libraries of the split are the ones planning/layout.md names: arithmetic, base, dsp, objects,
render, iec61937 and ac3 (what was src/forge), beside the AC-4 four and the rest.
tools/checks/layering.json holds the same assignment of src/forge files for the dependency check;
test_layoutdef.py keeps the two equal.
