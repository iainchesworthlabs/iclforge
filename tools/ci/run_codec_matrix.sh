# Exercises forge across the layout/tool/metadata matrix it documents in its
# own --help text, so a sanitizer build's "make it fail loudly" only works if
# something actually walks these code paths. ctest's 200+ cases cover a lot of
# encoder/decoder logic in isolation; this script covers the combinations a
# real user's command line would hit - every layout, every Annex E tool
# token, both Atmos container modes, and the metadata options - round-tripped
# through encode -> decode -> levels/loudness/spdif/mkv/mp4, and back out
# again through demux.
#
# Every stream this script produces also gets FFmpeg's independent strict
# decode (CONTRIBUTING.md's "Oracles" list, #2) alongside the in-repo
# decoder's `run decode`, per the verification-gap table in README.md:
#   - The in-repo decoder reads every Annex E tool combination now (standard
#     and enhanced coupling, spectral extension, AHT, transient pre-noise
#     processing, and any combination including 7.1.4 with several at once),
#     so every `run decode` below is a real, asserted round-trip - there is
#     nothing left to tolerate a known refusal against.
#   - FFmpeg still has no oracle at all for 7.1.4 (`714`): its
#     ff_ac3_parse_header rejects a second dependent substream's
#     `substreamid != 0` in every container tried, regardless of which Annex
#     E tools are in play. Those streams skip the FFmpeg check entirely
#     rather than being tolerated - there is nothing to tolerate a decode
#     failure against, and skipping (not tolerating) is what keeps this
#     script from silently claiming FFmpeg coverage it does not have. The
#     in-repo decoder is checked at 7.1.4 same as everywhere else.
#   - Same story, different reason, for enhanced coupling (`ecpl`) and
#     transient pre-noise processing (`tpn`): FFmpeg's own Annex E parser has
#     never read either tool's syntax at all, so there is no "known refusal"
#     to tolerate, just no oracle - see docs/verification.md's own note.
#     Those streams skip the FFmpeg check too; the in-repo decoder round trip
#     still covers them.
#   - Two whole COMMANDS, not just one FFmpeg check each, are conditional:
#     `atmos-adm` (ADM BWF reader) and `atmos-iab` (IAB reader phase 3) only run
#     for real when this build was configured with -DICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM=ON,
#     which neither of this script's two CI callers' presets turn on - see
#     each command's own block below for the detection and the reasoning.
#
# Usage: run_codec_matrix.sh <path-to-forge> [workdir]
# Exits non-zero on the first command that fails (a sanitizer violation exits
# non-zero on its own via -fno-sanitize-recover=all; this also catches a
# plain crash, a refused command that should have succeeded, or an FFmpeg
# decode that should have succeeded but didn't).
#
# ICLFORGE_CROSS_TIER_CHECK=1 switches this script into a different mode: run
# the entire matrix below TWICE from the SAME binary, once with
# ICLFORGE_SIMD_TIER=sse2 and once with =avx2 (see
# libs/base/include/iclforge/base/detail/cpu_features.hpp), then byte-diff the two output
# trees. This is the runtime-dispatch analogue of the -DICLFORGE_SIMD=generic
# cross-build check documented above: that one proves two different binaries
# (SIMD tier baked in at compile time) agree bit-for-bit; this one proves the
# SAME binary agrees with itself across the two runtime code paths
# cpu::has_avx2() switches between. A host that cannot execute AVX2 skips the
# second pass with an explicit message and still exits 0 - degrading to
# exactly today's guarantee, never silently claiming a check that did not
# run.

# --- AC-3: real programme material, across each layout's whole rate range --
# Everything above drives AC-3 from `sine`, `silence`, or bootstrap_51.wav -
# which is itself a decoded sine. Synthetic material cannot reach a whole
# class of encoder state, and not because of some missing option: a
# stationary tone puts near-identical exponents in every block, so
# needs_new_exponents never splits a frame into several exponent runs, and
# any defect that only appears at a mid-frame run boundary is structurally
# unreachable - at every layout, and at every bitrate.
#
# The deltbaie stale-delta defect was exactly that shape. A delta bit
# allocation that stopped part-way through a frame was never cleared, so the
# decoder went on applying it, its allocation diverged from the encoder's,
# and every field after that point was read at the wrong bit offset. It
# produced streams neither this project's decoder nor FFmpeg would accept,
# and it survived this matrix, the fidelity gate and the whole unit suite -
# because none of them ever fed the encoder real programme material. Sweeping
# the rate range on sine would not have caught it either; only the material
# axis does.
#
# So: the golden fixtures, swept rather than pinned to one comfortable rate,
# each stream decoded by BOTH the in-repo decoder and FFmpeg. The rate lists
# are each layout's real lower bound for this material - 5.1 needs 96 kbit/s
# before a frame can carry its own headers, stereo and 1+1 need 48, mono
# reaches the full range. E-AC-3 is not repeated here: quality_race.py's CI
# gate already round-trips these same fixtures through eac3-encode across its
# tool variants, so that path is not blind the way this one was.

# exponents, bit allocation, delta, AHT gains and the coupling/spectral-
# extension coordinates - refusing the run at the first disagreement. It is
# the only check here that can see a defect BOTH sides share, which is the gap
# docs/verification.md names for ecpl, tpn, fscod2 and 7.1.4: those have no
# external oracle at all, so a round trip and an SNR gate agree with
# themselves however the spec was read.

# units - well past the frame-0 false pass the same history records, and short

# --- Stream tools (stream tools): no re-encode except where one is the point -

# re-encodes; metadata/normalize rewrite bsi in place and re-stamp the CRCs;
# cut/cat move whole access units. Every stream any of them produces goes
# through FFmpeg's strict decode like everything else here, which is what
# actually proves the CRC re-stamp: -err_detect crccheck makes a wrong crc1 or
# crc2 a failing exit code rather than a silently concealed frame.
#
# cut + cat is checked as a ROUND TRIP rather than by eyeballing a duration:
# splitting a stream on an access-unit boundary and joining the halves back
# must reproduce the input byte for byte, which is the strongest available
# statement that a frame-aligned cut neither dropped nor duplicated anything.
# 0.512 s is exactly 16 access units at 48 kHz, so the split needs no snapping.
