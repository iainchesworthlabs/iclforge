"""Assert the Crucible's package carries a window that can start,
and the notices for what it ships.

The archive cpack produces for the `crucible` component (cmake/Packaging.cmake)
is the demo's release asset. Its failure mode is not an empty file - it is a
plausible-looking archive holding crucible.exe with no Qt beside it, which
installs and then does not start, because the Qt deploy script
(apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt) was filed under the wrong CPack component or
did not run. That is what this checks, from CI (.github/workflows/_build.yml)
and from a local `cpack --preset pack-windows-msvc` run just the same:

    python tools/ci/check_crucible_package.py packages/iclforge-crucible-*.zip
    python tools/ci/check_crucible_package.py packages/iclforge-crucible-*-Linux.tar.gz
    python tools/ci/check_crucible_package.py packages/iclforge-crucible-*-Darwin.zip

The layout it expects is the one qt_generate_deploy_qml_app_script() produces
and the existing runtime archive already uses: on Windows, the binaries in
bin/ beside a qt.conf whose `Prefix = ..` sends Qt to the sibling plugins/,
qml/ and translations/ directories; on macOS, Qt deployed inside
crucible.app itself (Contents/Frameworks/, Contents/PlugIns/ and
Contents/Resources/qml/), the same bundle layout forge-gui.app already uses.

The second thing it checks is the content of NOTICES.txt, the third-party
notices notices/ generates per platform at configure time. A
notices file is easy to get subtly wrong without any name going missing: one
written for the other platform (a PipeWire section in the Windows zip, the
driver's MS-PL text in a .deb), or one whose Qt Quick 3D section disagrees
with whether qml/QtQuick3D/ actually shipped. So the file is read, not just
listed: each platform has phrases it must contain and phrases it must not,
the Qt version token must have been filled, and on Windows the Quick 3D
section must be present exactly when the payload is.

The third is a negative: the Windows zip carries no driver .inf, and neither
Windows nor macOS carries the driver's PowerShell scripts at all (macOS needs
no driver - it silences at the tap instead). See FORBIDDEN_WINDOWS_SUFFIX and
FORBIDDEN_MACOS below for why a check exists to assert that something is
missing.

The fourth is another negative, and the one most likely to come back: the zip
carries no part of Qt's test module. See FORBIDDEN_WINDOWS_QT_TEST_QML and
FORBIDDEN_WINDOWS_QT_TEST_DLLS for the Windows shape, and
FORBIDDEN_MACOS_QT_TEST_QML, FORBIDDEN_MACOS_QT_TEST_FILES and
FORBIDDEN_MACOS_QT_TEST_FRAMEWORKS for the same rule inside a macOS bundle.

# The driver is NOT in the Windows package, and this is here to fail the day
# it is. The zip ships install.ps1 and remove.ps1 (above) but nothing for them
# to install, because the driver is test-signed only and shipping it waits on
# an EV certificate and attestation. Three places say so in their own words,
# and they have to agree:
#
#   - docs/crucible/install.md, which tells a reader not to turn test signing
#     on or memory integrity off for a driver that is not there;
#   - the Settings page's driver note (apps/crucible/ui/assets/qml/SettingsPage.qml);
#   - package_complete() in
#     apps/crucible/engine/src/platform/windows/driver_tools.cpp, which requires
#     IclForgeNullSink.inf and so greys Install driver on every packaged copy.
#
# They had drifted before this check existed: driverDir() finds the packaged
# scripts beside the executable, so a packaged copy took the "build from
# source" branch of that note and read as a checkout, while install.md sent
# the same reader to bcdedit for a driver the download does not hold. The
# .inf is the file package_complete() looks for, so its absence is exactly
# the condition those three describe. Asserting the absence means that the
# day the driver does ship, this job goes red and the three above are
# revisited alongside this check - which no positive check would ever prompt
# anyone to do.

# directory, and apps/crucible/ui/tests/qml/tst_*.qml all `import QtTest` - so
# qml/QtTest/ went into every zip, and windeployqt followed the plugin in it
# with Qt6Test.dll and Qt6QuickTest.dll. Only crucible_qmltests loads any of
# that, and it is never installed. cmake/StripQtTestDeployment.cmake deletes
# the three at install time and carries the measurement behind them.
#
# This is asserted here rather than trusted because the removal is a deletion
# after the fact: it is silently undone by a Qt version that deploys to a
# different path, by an application whose install rules stop calling the
# script, or by a second module arriving the same way. None of those would
# fail a build - the package would get bigger again, which is precisely
