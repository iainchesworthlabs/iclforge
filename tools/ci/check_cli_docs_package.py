"""Assert a runtime package carries forge's man page and its four completions.

apps/forge/cli/CMakeLists.txt generates forge.1 and the bash/zsh/fish/PowerShell
completion scripts by running the freshly built forge (CLI shell completions), so a
cross build - which cannot run its own output - installs none of them. The
test for "is this a cross build" was CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING until #527, and that
variable is TRUE on every native Linux and macOS build in this tree, because
CMakeDetermineSystem sets it from the mere presence of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and
cmake/toolchains/{linux.gcc,linux.llvm,macos.llvm}.toolchain.cmake each set
that unconditionally while every Linux/macOS preset chainloads one. Both Linux
.tar.gz, both .deb, both .rpm and the universal .dmg therefore shipped no man
page and no completions, for as long as the guard stood, and nothing went red:
the only test asserting their presence is the `test do` block in
packaging/homebrew/Formula/iclforge.rb, and a Homebrew build passes no
toolchain file, so it kept passing. This is the assertion that was missing:

    python3 tools/ci/check_cli_docs_package.py packages/iclforge-0.7.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
    python3 tools/ci/check_cli_docs_package.py packages/iclforge-0.7.0-Darwin.zip
    python3 tools/ci/check_cli_docs_package.py merged            # an install tree

Run from .github/workflows/_build.yml on the Linux and macOS legs, and over
the lipo-merged tree the universal .dmg is built from, which is its own
opportunity to lose these files - the merge walks one architecture's tree and
copies through what it finds.

The archive it reads is the runtime component's .tar.gz (Linux) or .zip
(macOS). The .deb and .rpm are built from the same install tree in the same
cpack run and carry the same five files, so inspecting them as well would
catch nothing more - and the RPM generator gzips the man page to
forge.1.gz, which would make the expected names generator-specific for no
extra failure mode found. The same reasoning check_crucible_package.py's
Linux half already uses for reading the tarball rather than the .deb.
