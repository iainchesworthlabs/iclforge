"""Property/fuzz harness over the AC-3 ENCODER's own input space.

Every fuzzing target this project already has (libs/ac3/fuzz/fuzz_ac3_decode.cpp and
friends, .github/workflows/fuzz.yml) mutates an ALREADY-ENCODED bitstream:
they ask "does the decoder survive corrupt input". Nothing asked the other
question - "does the encoder, driven across its own legal configuration space
by adversarial but perfectly valid audio, ever emit a stream a decoder
refuses". tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh walks a hand-enumerated list of command
lines against one bootstrap tone; tools/checks/check_matrix_coverage.py only checks
that each option TOKEN appears in that list. Neither has any notion of option
COMBINATIONS, and neither varies the input material at all.

That gap is not hypothetical. PR #186 fixed an encoder defect where deltbaie
== 0 was emitted to mean "no delta bit allocation this block" when A/52
§5.4.3.47 defines it outside block 0 as "retain the previous block's delta
bit allocation". The encoder's allocation and the decoder's then disagreed,
every subsequent field was read at the wrong bit offset, and the stream was
rejected by BOTH this project's decoder and FFmpeg. It escaped ctest, the
codec matrix, the gold-reference gate and every fuzzing job, because reaching
it needs a specific input SHAPE - dense harmonic content followed by digital
silence part-way through one frame, so an exponent run stops wanting a delta
correction mid-frame - at a rate low enough for the allocator to have wanted
one in the first place. No hand-written matrix would think to enumerate that.
A generator finds it in seconds; the `cliff` audio profile below is that
shape, named and kept.

What one case does:

  1. Draw a random-but-legal encoder configuration (layout, bitrate,
     coupling, DRC profile, heavy compression, dialnorm, downmix levels,
     forward-MDCT path, and layout 1+1's second-programme twins of those).
  2. Draw adversarial PCM and write it as a real WAV - built per 256-sample
     BLOCK, not per file, so a frame's character can change part-way through
     it. That is what drives exponent-run splits, block switching and the
     delta bit allocation decisions the configuration space alone cannot
     reach.
  3. Encode it.
  4. Decode the result with BOTH this project's own decoder (`forge decode`)
     and FFmpeg's strict decode - the same invocation and the same reasoning
     as run_ffmpeg_check() in tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh, -xerror included,
     because -err_detect alone leaves ffmpeg's exit code at 0 after a logged
     error. A refusal from either one fails the case, with one arbitrated
     carve-out: when only FFmpeg's default invocation refuses, and the same
     bytes then decode cleanly with `-f ac3` forced and every error check
     kept, the refusal came from libavformat's container GUESS and not from
     the decoder, and the case counts as "misprobed" rather than failed - see
     the second paragraph above MIN_STREAM_BYTES for the measured mechanics
     and for why no encoder-side change can prevent it.

Two independent decoders matter here for the same reason they do in the codec
matrix: a stream that only round-trips against its own encoder proves much
less than one two unrelated implementations both accept.

Determinism. Every case is a pure function of a single 64-bit case seed, so a
failure is reproducible from the one number printed with it - see --replay.
The master seed only decides which case seeds get drawn; it is printed at the
start of every run, failure or not.

Scope: AC-3 (`forge encode`) only. The bug that motivated this is AC-3-only
(E-AC-3 computes its delta bit allocation once per frame and its decoder
clears at block 0, so its state cannot go stale between blocks), and AC-3's
configuration space is the one whose acceptance envelope this file pins
below. E-AC-3's own space - the Annex E tool tokens, VBR, the wider layouts -
is tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py (E-AC-3 encoder fuzzing), a separate file for the
same reason this one names the scope at all: its acceptance envelope has a
ceiling as well as a floor (frmsiz is a word count, not a table index) and its
ORACLE is a different shape, since FFmpeg does not read E-AC-3 whole. The two
share this file's PCM generator, which that one imports, and nothing else.

# The smallest elementary stream this harness will hand FFmpeg, in bytes.
#
# Not a property of AC-3, and not a guess. FFmpeg auto-detects the container
# of a raw .ac3 file by probing, and on a stream of only a few kilobytes that
# probe is unreliable in a way that has nothing to do with whether the
# bitstream is valid. Measured while building this: a perfectly good 5-frame,
# 1920-byte mono stream was rejected with "Invalid data found when processing
# input" before decoding began, while the SAME BYTES decoded cleanly under
# `-f ac3` with the full -err_detect crccheck+bitstream+buffer+explode set,
# and the same content at ten frames probed fine. Narrowing it further:
# overwriting the crc1 field of any single middle frame - or zeroing crc1
# outright, which can only make the stream MORE wrong - flipped the probe from
# reject to accept, with every BSI header byte identical throughout. That is a
# probe-scoring artifact on a short file, not a defect a decoder would ever
# see.
#
# tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh never meets it because everything it encodes
# runs for seconds. Rather than force -f ac3 and quietly stop testing the same
# thing the codec matrix tests, this harness keeps that script's exact
# invocation and stays in the size regime where it means what it says. 16 KiB
# is roughly eight times the size where the effect was last seen.
#
# This floor keeps the harness out of the SIZE regime where the probe is
# unreliable; it cannot keep it out of the regime where the probe is OUTRUN.
# Case seed 1124127684685913171 (stereo at 512 kbit/s, 48 kHz: 2048-byte
# frames) produced a stream FFmpeg 8.0 refuses to OPEN ("could not find codec
# parameters", from the mpeg demuxer of all places) while the same bytes
# decode cleanly under `-f ac3` with the full -err_detect set, every
# syncframe sits on an exact 2048-byte boundary, and both CRC words of every
# frame check out. Mechanics, read out of ffmpeg's own probe sources:
# auto-detection scores windows of 2048/4096/8192/... bytes and commits to
# the first format scoring above 25; libavformat/ac3dec.c only goes above 25
# once SEVEN consecutive syncframes fit inside the window, which at 2048
# bytes per frame first happens in the 16 KiB window; libavformat/mpeg.c
# returns 26 for as little as one "00 00 01 bb" plus two "00 00 01 ba"
# patterns (each ba followed by one plausible header byte) anywhere in a
# window. That race was decided inside the first 8 KiB - four AC-3 frames,
# score 25, against an MPEG-PS 26 - so nothing appended later can win it
# back: the same stream concatenated out to 112 frames still probes as
# MPEG-PS, and the three matched patterns sit inside ordinary
# quantized-mantissa bytes the encoder does not get to choose. Any window
# whose rival patterns accumulate before seven frames do loses the same way,
# so at 48 kHz every rate from 320 kbit/s up leaves the 8 KiB window
# undecidable in ac3's favour; higher rates just stay exposed longer.
#
# So a default-invocation refusal is not yet a verdict on the bitstream, and
# run_case() arbitrates: rerun with `-f ac3` forced, every error check kept.
# Clean forced decode -> "misprobed", counted and printed in the summary but
# not a failure, because the encoder has no move left to make against it.
# Refused even when forced -> a real failure, reported with the forced run's
# stderr, which names the actual decode error instead of the probe's guess.

# Where each layout's usable rate range starts, measured against this build
# rather than derived from the spec. The refusal is not a table lookup but
# iclforge::ac3::FrameEncoder's own budget check (encoder.cpp, "the chosen configuration
# cannot fit its own headers at this rate"), and its cost moves with how many
# streams the layout codes, with coupling and DRC, and - through the exponent
# strategy and the delta bit allocation - with the AUDIO. So there is no one
# floor to record; there are two, and conflating them would make this table
# either a lie or useless:
#
#   robust  every rate from here up encodes whatever you feed it. A refusal at
#           or above this rate is a regression, and --check-envelope asserts it
#           across a spread of deliberately different probe material.
#   min     the lowest rate this generator DRAWS. Between min and robust the
#           answer genuinely depends on the input, so drawing there is real
#           coverage of the most bit-starved corner of the space - it just
#           means some of those cases come back refused rather than encoded.
#           --check-envelope asserts something still encodes here, so a min
