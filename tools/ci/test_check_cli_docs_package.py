"""Unit tests for check_cli_docs_package.py, the forge man page/completions gate.

stdlib `unittest`, not pytest, for the reason test_write_measurement_badges.py
gives: this runs in ci.yml's script-lint job, which installs nothing beyond its
linters, and the script under test is stdlib-only itself.

Two things are worth holding down here. The first is the gate's whole point:
an archive that looks complete - the binary is there, the licence is there -
and carries none of the five generated files still has to fail, because that
is exactly the shape every Linux and macOS package had while the guard in
apps/forge/cli/CMakeLists.txt tested CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING (see the script header).
The second is the top-level-directory normalisation, which is where the
equivalent Crucible gate had a real bug: a correct archive was reported as
entirely missing. Both archive shapes are built here, with and without a
wrapping directory, and macOS's root-level forge-gui.app is included because it
is the case that makes a per-name strip give the wrong answer.

Run: python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/ci -p 'test_*.py'
