"""Property/fuzz harness over the E-AC-3 ENCODER's own input space.

The AC-3 half of this question is tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py, whose own
header named where it stopped and why - "E-AC-3's own space - the Annex E tool
tokens, VBR, the wider layouts - is a real remaining gap, and deliberately not
smuggled in half-covered here".

This file is that gap (E-AC-3 encoder fuzzing); that note now points here instead. It
asks the same question of
`eac3-encode` and `atmos-encode` that the AC-3 harness asks of `encode`: does
the encoder, driven across its own legal configuration space by adversarial
but perfectly valid audio, ever emit a stream a decoder refuses - or refuse,
crash or mis-frame something it should have encoded?

It shares that file's PCM generator by importing it rather than copying it, so
the adversarial material (the per-256-sample-BLOCK plan, the `cliff` profile
the deltbaie defect needed, the correlation modes) stays one implementation
serving both codecs.

What is different here, and why this is a separate file rather than a --codec
switch on the other one:

  * The configuration space barely overlaps. Annex E tool tokens (cpl, ecpl,
    spx, aht, tpn, their band-edge pins, `auto`), VBR, `fscod2` half sample
    rates, eight layouts including three that need dependent substreams, and
    a second command (`atmos-encode`) with an object count of its own.
  * The ACCEPTANCE envelope is a different shape. AC-3's frmsizcod indexes
    Table 5.18, so its frame size is fixed by the rate pair. E-AC-3 signals
    the size directly in frmsiz, which is 11 bits - so the ceiling is a WORD
    COUNT, and at the half rates an ordinary Table 5.18 bitrate runs past it.
    See CEILING_WORDS.
  * The ORACLE is a different shape, and this is the big one. FFmpeg reads
    AC-3 whole. It does not read E-AC-3 whole, and the parts it cannot read
    are exactly the parts this harness exists to cover.

--- the oracle classes ------------------------------------------------------

docs/verification.md's "Where the oracles don't reach" records what FFmpeg
does and does not read; tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh acts on it by SKIPPING
the FFmpeg check for those cells rather than tolerating a failure, which is
the right call for a hand-enumerated matrix. A generator drawing thousands of
configurations needs the distinction to be a first-class part of the verdict
instead, because "clean" has to mean something different in each class. So
every case is classified before it runs, and every stream is then checked as
hard as something external still can:

  full    FFmpeg's strict decode, byte-for-byte the invocation
          run_ffmpeg_check() in run_codec_matrix.sh uses. Available when the
          access unit has at most one dependent substream, no ecpl and no tpn,
          and a normal sample rate.

  header  FFmpeg cannot decode the audio, but the FRAMING is still checked -
          by two independent means, neither of which needs a decode:

            * syncframe_walk(), this file's own walk over the four fields
              that decide E-AC-3's framing (syncword, strmtyp, substreamid,
              frmsiz). No tables, no coding tools, nothing shared with the
              encoder, and it works at EVERY layout - including the ones
              FFmpeg cannot parse at all. This is what makes the class
              genuinely non-empty rather than a polite name for "skipped".
            * ffprobe's own syncframe walk, where FFmpeg can be trusted to do
              one: access-unit count, exact byte tiling, sample rate. Not
              asked for a layout needing two dependent substreams - see
              header_check() for the stream that proved why.

  none    Nothing external and nothing independent says anything at all. This
          class is empty: syncframe_walk() reaches every stream this harness
          can produce. It exists so a future cell that escapes even that is
          reported as such rather than quietly counted as a pass.

Which class a case lands in, and why, is measured against FFmpeg 8.0 rather
than assumed - see ORACLE_GAPS and --check-oracles. Every class still runs the
in-repo `forge decode` round trip; the class only decides what ELSE runs.

The weaker guarantee in the `header` class is stated plainly because it is
real: a misreading of the spec shared by this project's encoder AND its
decoder would survive it, and so would one shared by the encoder and the field
layout syncframe_walk() reads. docs/verification.md says the same thing about
the CI gate that covers ecpl/tpn today. What framing does prove is where a
bit-offset defect - the shape of the deltbaie bug that motivated the AC-3
harness - shows up first: a syncframe whose contents are written at the wrong
offset is a syncframe whose frmsiz no longer lands the next syncword where it
promised.

--- determinism -------------------------------------------------------------

Every case is a pure function of a single 64-bit case seed, so a failure is
reproducible from the one number printed with it - see --replay. The master
seed only decides which case seeds get drawn; it is printed at the start of
every run, failure or not.

# Where each layout's usable rate range starts, measured against this build at
# 48 kHz rather than derived from the spec, with exactly the two columns the
# AC-3 harness's LAYOUTS table has and for the same reason: the refusal is
# iclforge::ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder's own budget check, and its cost moves with how many
# substreams the layout codes, with the Annex E tools, and - through the
# exponent strategy and the delta bit allocation - with the AUDIO. So there is
# no one floor; there are two, and conflating them would make this table
# either a lie or useless.
#
#   robust  every rate from here up encodes whatever you feed it, under every
#           tool set. A refusal at or above this rate is a regression, and
#           --check-envelope asserts it across a spread of deliberately
#           different probe material AND a spread of tool sets.
#   min     the lowest rate this generator DRAWS. Between min and robust the
#           answer genuinely depends on the input and on the tools, so drawing
#           there is real coverage of the most bit-starved corner of the space
#           - it just means some of those cases come back refused rather than
#           encoded. --check-envelope asserts something still encodes there,
#           so a min set below anything reachable shows up instead of silently
#           burning budget on cases that can never run.
#
# 48 kHz is the tightest sample rate and so the one worth tabulating: frame
# bytes are bitrate x 1536 / sample_rate / 8, so a LOWER sample rate buys MORE
# room at the same kbps and a floor measured at 48 kHz is conservative
# everywhere below it. Measured on this build: 5.1's floor is 112 kbit/s at
# 48 kHz but only 56 at 24 kHz and 40 at 16 kHz.

# as two independent programmes - a strict identity, never a fold-down - so it

        syncword   16 bits, 0x0B77   (§E2.3.1.1)
        strmtyp     2 bits           (§E2.3.1.2: 0 independent, 1 dependent)

        frmsiz     11 bits           (§E2.3.1.3: words - 1)

    So a walk over them needs no bit allocation, no exponent strategy, no
    tables - and shares nothing with the encoder that produced the stream. If
    a frmsiz does not describe its own syncframe, the very next read lands on
    something that is not a syncword and this says so. That is exactly the

    out to be correct - see ORACLE_GAPS' "two dependent substreams" entry.

    independent substream starts a new access unit. That is true of everything
    `eac3-encode` and `atmos-encode` emit today - one programme per access
    unit - but §E2.3.1.2 allows up to eight independent substreams carrying
    several programmes, and a front end that emits them would make this walk
    count one access unit per programme rather than per access unit. It fails
    loudly if so ("the syncframes make X access units"), which is the right

    `-f eac3` is forced rather than arbitrated the way the full decode

    it to fail - the misprobe question belongs to the decode path, which keeps

      1. ffprobe reads the stream at all.
      2. It finds exactly the access units the encoder says it wrote, and

    and why none can be excluded up front; everything else, including a zero
    exit that wrote nothing and any exit code that is not 0, 1 or 5, is a
    failure.

    The exit-code check is not pedantry. The first defect this harness found
    was an assert() firing on a legal-looking configuration - an abort, which
    subprocess reports as 3 or 0x80000003 on Windows and as -6 (SIGABRT) on
    Linux, never as 1 or 5. A plain `!= 0` test with a message allow-list
    behind it would have reported that as a tolerated refusal the moment the
    abort happened to print a matching line first.

    1 and 5 both cover REFUSALS entries because the CLI's own structured exit
    codes (CLI shell completions) split them across two classes: a configuration that is
    invalid on its face, checked before any audio is read (header room, frmsiz
    ceiling, object count - exit 1, "usage") versus dialnorm=auto's own
    loudness measurement finding nothing to measure once it actually reads the
    file (sub-gate/unmeasurable loudness - exit 5, "runtime"), regardless of
    which of eac3-encode/atmos-encode took that path. Only that pair exits 5,

    A hand-maintained table is exactly the kind of second copy this project's

    checked rather than believed. Three assertions:

      robust  EVERY probe encodes at EVERY rate from here up, under EVERY tool
              set. This is the one that catches a regression - an encoder that
              started refusing configurations it used to fit.
      min     at least one probe/tool pair encodes at each rate from min up to
              robust. This catches a min set below anything reachable, which
              would silently spend the run's budget on cases that can never
              encode.
      ceiling at each Annex E half rate, the first legal Table 5.18 rate above
              what frmsiz can signal must be refused CLEANLY - exit 1 with a

              still encode. This is the deterministic gate on the defect that
              motivated CEILING_WORDS: before the fix that refusal was an
              abort, and an abort passes any "did it refuse" test that only
              looks for a non-zero exit.

    Run in parallel, unlike the AC-3 harness's equivalent, because this sweep
    is an order of magnitude larger: eight layouts rather than four, and a
    tool-set axis the AC-3 envelope has no equivalent of (six probes x five
    tool sets per rate, not six probes). Each encode is an independent process
    writing its own output file, so the only shared state is the read-only
    probe WAVs. It stays a seconds-cheap gate that way, which is what lets
    ci.yml run it on every pull request.
