"""Compare a built shared library's exported dynamic symbols against a
checked-in allowlist.

Every library here already builds with CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden, so
nm -D --defined-only is the exact set a consumer can link against - anything
NOT ICLFORGE_AC3_EXPORT (or one of the sibling macros) never reaches the dynamic
symbol table at all. This script does not re-derive that set from the source;
it just proves the .so's ACTUAL export set matches what was last reviewed and
committed, so an accidental new export (a missing ICLFORGE_AC3_EXPORT removed, a
template instantiation that leaked, a symbol visibility regression) is a
diff a human sees rather than a silent widening of the ABI surface.

One allowlist file per library, named after the .so's basename
(libiclforge_ac3.so.txt), one demangled symbol per line, sorted. `--update`
regenerates them from the libraries passed on the command line instead of
checking; run it once to seed a new library or after a deliberate, reviewed
export-set change.

Two things to know before reading a regeneration diff:

The stored text is c++filt-version sensitive. The same mangled symbol can
demangle to different text under different binutils - libac3iab.so.txt was
seeded by an older c++filt that printed `std::istream` where the current one
prints `std::basic_istream<char, std::char_traits<char> >`. That shows up in
a diff as one line removed and one added, and reads exactly like a signature
change, but the ELF symbol is identical and nothing about the ABI moved.
Before treating such a pair as a real change, check whether the two lines are
the same function under two renderings.

Regenerate against a build whose toolchain matches CI's (the pinned LLVM in
.github/workflows/_toolchain-versions.yml). The cheap way to prove it does,
before trusting `--update`: run this script in CHECK mode against the fresh
build first and confirm it reproduces the mismatch set CI itself reports.
Libraries that then regenerate byte-identical are the corroboration - if the
local demangler disagreed with the committed files, those would churn too.

This script DOES exit non-zero on a real mismatch - the advisory/non-blocking
behaviour the ABI gate wants pre-1.0 comes from the calling CI job's own ABI_ENFORCE
switch, not from this script staying silent. That is deliberate: once AP1's
freeze flips that one value, this script's behaviour does not need to change
at all. (tools/ci/compare_performance.py splits the same problem the other
way round - it reports its verdict as a step output and lets a separate gate
job decide - because the job that runs IT is continue-on-error and would
swallow an exit code.)

stdlib-only (argparse/pathlib/subprocess), matching every other script in
this directory - the runner needs no provisioning beyond nm/c++filt, which
binutils already puts on every Linux CI leg.

# Itanium-mangled prefixes for namespaces that are compiler/libstdc++
# implementation detail, not anything ICLFORGE_AC3_EXPORT controls. Which
# template gets instantiated - and therefore lands in the dynamic table at
# all, since CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden does not extend to system-header
# templates - shifts with every compiler/libstdc++ version, unrelated to
# any change this project makes. `_ZSt`/`_ZNSt` cover both the compressed
# "St" substitution and the nested-name form of std::; `_ZN9__gnu_cxx`
# covers libstdc++'s internal namespace (length-prefixed "__gnu_cxx", 9
# chars); `_ZN11__cxxabiv1` covers the C++ ABI runtime (RTTI/exception
# internals another shared library using polymorphism can just as easily
# leak).
#
# The `K` forms matter as much as the plain ones: Itanium mangles a CONST
# member function as `_ZNK<name>`, not `_ZN<name>`, so `std::_Hashtable<...
# >::find(...) const` arrives as `_ZNKSt10_Hashtable...` and slips past a
# `_ZNSt` check entirely. That is not hypothetical - it is how
# `std::_Hashtable<int, std::pair<int const, int>, ...>::find(int const&)
# const` came to be reported as newly-exported project surface on libac4.so
# (2026-08-31). `_ZTV`/`_ZTI`/`_ZTS` are the vtable, typeinfo and
# typeinfo-name of a std:: type, which are emitted into whichever library
# instantiates the type and shift for exactly the same reasons; they carry
# the `St`/`N9__gnu_cxx` substitution one or two characters further in, so
# they need their own entries rather than a longer prefix on the existing
# ones. tools/ci/abi-suppressions.ini encodes the same set for abidiff -
# keep the two in step.

    entries - undefined (imported) symbols are excluded by --defined-only,
    and anything hidden by CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET never appears in the
    dynamic table to begin with.

    The stdlib filter runs on the RAW mangled name, before demangling,
    because a demangled function-template instantiation shows its return
    type ahead of the qualified name (e.g. "long std::__lg<long>(long)") -
    a prefix or substring check on demangled text would either miss these
    or, worse, wrongly exclude a real project export whose signature merely
    mentions a std:: type it returns (e.g. iclforge::containers::mp4::fragment's
    std::expected<...> return type). The mangled encoding always puts the
    symbol's own qualified name first, so a prefix check there is
    unambiguous. c++filt then demangles only the survivors, so the
    allowlist still reads as C++ names a reviewer can recognise.
