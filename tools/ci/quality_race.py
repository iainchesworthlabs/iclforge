"""Quality race: our encoder vs FFmpeg's, at matched bitrates.

Synthesizes stereo program material (tones with vibrato, a sweep, filtered
noise, correlated near-mono content for rematrixing, tone bursts), encodes it
with both encoders, decodes both with FFmpeg (the neutral referee), aligns by
cross-correlation, and reports SNR vs the original - plus a MOS-LQO column
(ViSQOL audio mode, see perceptual_score()'s own docstring for why ViSQOL
over PEAQ and which package) on the modes that print or export a table.
Gracefully "-" when `visqol-python` isn't installed - it never becomes a
required dependency just to run a quality race.

Modes:
  ac3        - our AC-3 encoder vs FFmpeg's, at 192-448 kbps
  fast-mdct  - direct-form (fast-mdct=off) vs the default §7.9.4 fast
               forward MDCT (EncoderConfig::fast_mdct), both decoded by
               FFmpeg - the quality evidence that made fast the default
  eac3       - our E-AC-3 encoder, one row per Annex E tool set, vs FFmpeg's
               E-AC-3 encoder, at the low rates the tools exist to serve
  eac3-51    - the same for 5.1, with genuinely decorrelated channels
  fgaincod   - E-AC-3 fast-gain control's E-AC-3 half: whether §7.2.2.4's measured
               fast-gain curve still wins once E-AC-3 charges for the
               per-block fgaincode element §8.2.12's implied 0x4 avoids.
               Five legs a rate: the default, the default pinned
               explicitly (a byte-identical zero-noise control), the curve,
               and search=distortion with fgaincod pinned and free - the
               last pair separating what the fast-gain second axis adds from what
               EQ13's one-axis search was already worth. Scored per time
               window, so every delta carries a paired standard error. `--with-51` adds the coupled
               5.1 legs on synthetic material; `--json-out PATH` writes the
               rows. See race_fgaincod().
  vbr        - the E-AC-3 rate-distortion curve VBR shipped without: sweeps
               VbrConfig.quality, measures what rate each point actually
               costs, and scores CBR and FFmpeg CBR at that same measured
               rate - so "does VBR at a given average rate beat CBR at that
               rate" has a number rather than a warning. Also checks the
               average-rate (ABR) mode lands on the rate it was asked for.
               See race_vbr(); `--json-out PATH` writes the rows as JSON.
  seam       - where the spectral extension notch lands, and how deep
  crosscheck - every tool set through BOTH decoders: FFmpeg and Dolby's own,
               via the reference player's GStreamer elements. Agreeing with
               one decoder says a stream is readable; agreeing with the
               reference implementation says it is right. Skips gracefully
               when the reference player is not installed.
  ci         - the CI gate: AC-3 and every E-AC-3 tool variant (stereo and
               5.1) against a numeric SNR/LSD floor per variant, real
               non-zero exit on regression. No table to read; see race_ci().
               Enhanced coupling and transient pre-noise processing are
               included too, scored through this project's own decoder
               rather than FFmpeg's (see decode_scores_ours) - neither tool
               has an external oracle at all.
  trend      - the CI-time half of the external-encoder landscape
               comparison (tools/generators/gen_external_baseline.py is the local-only
               half that actually invokes FFmpeg/DEE): encodes every
               committed fixed leg with THIS build and scores everything
               through this project's own decoder, so it needs neither
               FFmpeg's nor DEE's own encoder. Compute-only, no gate; see
               race_trend(). `--json-out PATH` writes the rows as JSON.
               `--spectrogram-dir PATH` additionally renders one PNG per leg
               (original/iclforge/FFmpeg/DEE spectrograms) via
               render_spectrograms() - this part DOES need an `ffmpeg`
               binary, only ever to decode the already-committed
               testdata/external-baseline/ bitstreams, never to encode.
  objects    - object-reconstruction quality: the committed five-object
               scene (testdata/audio/reference_objects.wav plus its
               .paths placements) encoded with `atmos-encode` and decoded
               back to per-object WAVs, one SNR/LSD/MOS row per object per
               rate. Compute-only, no gate; see race_objects(). There is no
               external oracle for object decode at all - not FFmpeg's
               decoder, not Dolby's - so this is a self-consistency series
               throughout, which that function's own comment spells out.
               `--json-out PATH` writes the rows as JSON.

Every mode except `ci` and `trend` takes `--material synth|speech|music`,
which swaps the synthesized source for one of the committed 30 s CC0
programme fixtures - see MATERIALS near main() for why that matters and why
those two modes decline it.

# --- Perceptual quality (ViSQOL) ---------------------------------------------
#
# SNR and the Bark-banded LSD/HF measures above are waveform- and envelope-
# level proxies for what a listener actually hears. ViSQOL (Google's Virtual
# Speech Quality Objective Listener, https://github.com/google/visqol) scores
# that more directly: a full-reference perceptual model that predicts a
# MOS-LQO (Mean Opinion Score - Listening Quality Objective), 1 (bad) to
# audio mode's ~4.75 ceiling.
#
# Chosen over PEAQ (ITU-R BS.1387): the PEAQ algorithm itself is FRAND-
# licensed ITU IP, not something this clean-room project wants to take a
# dependency on (see docs/concepts/object-signing.md for the same reasoning
# applied to Dolby's own authentication tag), and the one credible open
# implementation, GstPEAQ, documents its own non-conformance to the BS.1387-1
# tolerance and ships only as a GStreamer/C plugin - no Python surface, a
# heavier and less certain dependency than ViSQOL's Apache-2.0 Python package
# for a column that has to stay optional.
#
# Google's own google/visqol repo has no published PyPI wheel: its Python API
# is `pip install .` after a Bazel + TensorFlow source build (confirmed
# against the repo's own README, not assumed), which is not viable as an
# optional dependency for a casual local run or a CI container. `visqol-
# python` (PyPI, Apache-2.0, https://github.com/talker93/visqol-python) is a
# pure-Python reimplementation with prebuilt wheels and no Bazel/C++
# toolchain requirement; its own conformance suite scores audio-mode output
# within 0.0002 MOS-LQO of the reference C++ implementation across its test
# vectors. It bundles the audio-mode SVR model file, so no separate model
# download is needed once the package itself is installed - verified
# locally: identical audio scores ~4.73, a heavily noised copy scores 1.0,
# confirming the number actually moves with quality rather than being a
# stub.
#
# Optional exactly like ICLFORGE_WITH_ALSA (libs/audio/CMakeLists.txt): a
# missing `visqol-python` install skips this column with one clear message,
# printed once, and never fails the run. Nobody running a quality race
# locally should be forced to install it, and CI does not either - see
# ffmpeg-validate's own comment in .github/workflows/ci.yml for why.

# How much audio ViSQOL is ever handed for one score, in seconds.
#
# ViSQOL's patch matching is super-linear in signal length. Measured on this
# package (visqol-python 3.7.0, one machine, same synthetic pair truncated to
# each length):
#
#   2 s -> 2.2 s     4 s -> 5.8 s     6 s -> 9.8 s     8 s -> 14.1 s
#   3 s -> 3.9 s    10 s -> 20.5 s   30 s -> 127.8 s
#
# so a 30 s programme fixture costs 30x what a 3 s synthetic one does, and
# `trend` mode makes 62 distinct scoring calls per run across its eight legs.
# Uncapped, the programme legs alone would add over half an hour to a
# pull-request job. Capped at 4 s, the whole column measured about seven
# minutes (a full `trend` run took 10m48s with ViSQOL and 3m59s with it
# stubbed out).
#
# 4 s is where the score itself has converged: the same pair reads 4.336 at
# 2 s, 4.272 at 4 s, 4.257 at 6 s and 4.251 at 8 s, so the residual against a
# much longer window is ~0.02 MOS - and it is a CONSTANT offset, because the
# window is always the same deterministic span of the same fixture. Trend
# deltas, which is what every consumer of this column actually reads, are
# unaffected by a constant offset; only the absolute value moves, and only by
# less than the difference between two adjacent tool sets.
#
# Anything shorter than this is scored whole, so the existing 2.5-3 s
# synthetic fixtures are unaffected by this cap existing.

    o/d are aligned original/decoded arrays from align()/score_fixed, any
    channel count. Trimmed to MOS_WINDOW_S (see its own comment for the
    measured cost curve that makes the cap necessary) around the MIDDLE of
    the overlap rather than its start - a fixture's first second is the most
    likely place to find a fade-in, and align()'s own leading trim varies by
    a handful of samples between calls, so a centred window is both more
    representative and less sensitive to that. The same span is taken from
    both arrays, so the alignment align() established is preserved.

    Downmixed to mono by hand (plain channel average) before
    scoring rather than handed through as-is: measure_from_arrays() accepts
    a multi-channel array without erroring, but a real 6-channel A/B scored
    3.38 through its own internal handling against 1.60 for the identical
    pair downmixed by hand first - undocumented and not something to rely
    on. A plain mean matches ViSQOL audio mode's documented file-based
    behaviour ("down-mixes multi-channel to mono") and is at least a mixdown
    this function can promise callers.

    None on three distinct causes: the package isn't installed, the call
    itself raised (some native/runtime failure), or it returned a
    non-finite score - observed for real with a fully-silent degraded
    signal (NaN, not an exception) rather than assumed. The first two are
    each logged once per run, not once per row, so a long table doesn't
    repeat the same line; the non-finite case is quiet on purpose - it can
    legitimately recur per row (e.g. several silent-segment rows in the
    same run) without being a "the tool is unavailable" condition worth
    repeating a message for.

# --- Does the fast-gain curve survive E-AC-3's side-info bill? ------------
#
# AC-3 has followed a measured fgaincod curve since 0.7.0 because it costs
# nothing there: §7.2.2.4's fast gain rides the snroffst element AC-3 already
# sends every block. E-AC-3's baie does not carry fgaincod at all, so any code
# other than Table E1.4's implied 0x4 opens a separate per-block fgaincode
# element in ALL SIX blocks - 1 + 3*(nchans + cplinu) bits each - paid out of
# the mantissa budget. Whether the better masking curve is worth that is a
# measurement, which is what this mode is.
#
# Five legs per rate:
#
#   auto      - the shipped default: no element, implied 0x4. The baseline.
#   pin-0x4   - fgaincod=4 explicitly. Byte-identical to `auto` BY
#               CONSTRUCTION - encode_frame only sets frmfgaincode when the
#               pinned code differs from §8.2.12's, so stating 0x4 writes no
#               element either. It is carried as a control anyway, and it is
#               the most useful row in the table for reading the rest: every
#               one of its deltas must come out exactly 0.000, which is the
#               proof that encode -> FFmpeg decode -> align -> score has no
#               run-to-run noise at all. Any non-zero delta elsewhere is
#               therefore signal, not scatter. (What it is NOT is a
#               cost-only control - there is no way to buy the element
#               without also changing the code, so the side-info bill is
#               priced arithmetically instead: 1 + 3*(nchans + cplinu) bits a
#               block, six blocks, against the frame's own bit count.)
#   pin-N     - fgaincod pinned at rate_adaptive_fgaincod's own value for
#               this rate. (pin-N - auto) is the curve's benefit NET of the
#               element it had to open to get there, which is the question.
#   search-1ax- search=distortion with fgaincod pinned at the default, which
#               takes it out of the candidate set: exactly the one-axis
#               dbpbcod-only search EQ13 shipped, and the thing an earlier sweep
#               recorded as not moving the stereo/192 cell.
#   search-2ax- search=distortion left to move both axes, refitting each
#               candidate against its own side-info cost. The per-frame
#               answer, and (search-2ax - search-1ax) is what the fast-gain axis added to

# --- VBR characterisation ----------------------------------------------------
#
# VBR shipped as a per-frame quality knob with no evidence at all: no race
# leg, no trend row, no rate-distortion curve - only a warning in
# docs/concepts/ac3-eac3.md that cost "rises steeply in the top part of the
# quality range". This is the measurement that warning was standing in for.
#
# The question a VBR mode exists to answer is not "what does quality 0.6
# sound like", it is "at the rate this ends up costing, would plain CBR have
# done better". So every sweep point is scored against a CBR encode at the
# rate the VBR point actually measured - not at some nominal rate - and
# against FFmpeg's own CBR encoder at the same number, which is the neutral
# third opinion the rest of this file already leans on.
#
# The format's own ceiling is 2048 words per frame (frmsiz is 11 bits), which
# at 48 kHz is 1024 kbit/s. Every sweep point carries that as its max_kbps:
# without a bound, a high quality on real material asks for more than any
# legal frame can hold and the encoder refuses the frame outright (see
# VbrConfig::quality). Bounding at the FORMAT ceiling rather than at some
# tighter number keeps the curve honest - nothing is capped that the
# bitstream itself could have carried.

# decisions read the frame's own spectrum as well as the rate (see
# eac3_frame.cpp's own "What the content says" block) that set depends on the
# material here, not only on the bitrate - so its floor is the floor of the
# sets it can reach rather than a number of its own. Measured 2026-08-23
# against a real build on make_material()/make_material_51(): stereo 41.55 dB
# SNR / 6.08 dB LSD, 5.1 14.29 dB / 7.59 dB, both comfortably inside the bars
# below. A change to the policy that silently flipped either leg to the wrong
# set would land well under them.
#
# One thing this leg is load-bearing for beyond its own numbers: it is
# strict-decoded by FFmpeg, so it is what catches `auto` reaching for a tool
# FFmpeg cannot read. That is not hypothetical - it is how enhanced coupling
# was found to be unshippable in `auto` (docs/library/encoding-eac3.md).

    # make_material_transient() is four 2 s segments: (a) percussive hits,
    # (b) block-rate gated noise, (c) sparse clicks over near-silence, and
    # (d) a chord amplitude-modulated at 30 Hz, whose level "swings smoothly
    # but fully inside every frame". decode_scores calls align() with the
    # default skip of 1 s, so on 8 s of material the old asymmetric trim
    # (1 s off the front, 2 s off the end) scored seconds 1-6 - all of (b) and
    # (c), half of (a), and NONE of (d). Segment (d) begins exactly at second
    # 6. The leg was calibrated, and passing, on material that omitted one of
    # the four cases it was built out of - and the one whose whole point is a
    # level swing inside a single frame, which is precisely what an exponent
    # run plan has to cope with.
    #
    # The corrected window scores seconds 1-7, so half of (d) now counts.
    # SNR rises by a uniform +0.35 dB across every variant (more material,
    # slightly better waveform match) and every existing SNR floor still holds
    # with more headroom than before, so the floors are unchanged. LSD rises by
    # 0.86-1.20 dB, because (d) is genuinely harder to code than the segments
    # that were being scored in its place, and the ceilings do have to move.

    # Windows local build agree to within 0.03 dB, so these are not a
    # platform's numbers.
    #
    # The bars stay deliberately close to the measurement - +0.4 dB on the
    # worst member of each group, matching the margin this table already
    # carried before (0.34 dB on the old non-spx group). What this leg exists
    # for is the exponent-run plan, and every regression it actually caught
    # while it was being built cost 1 to 3 dB of SNR and 0.5 to 1.7 dB of LSD,
    # not the many dB a collapse elsewhere would. A ceiling loose enough to
    # ignore those would make the leg pointless. 0.4 dB is still thirteen
    # times the observed cross-platform spread.
    #
    # The absolute numbers are not comparable to the stationary stereo row's

# search= (EQ13), exercised THROUGH THE CLI.
#
# The gap this closes is not that the search is untested - libs/ac3/tests/quality's
# test_search.cpp and test_eac3_search.cpp cover it well, including that it
# lowers decoded error, that it is deterministic, that it changes the emitted
# parameters, and that it stays inert under VBR. It is that every one of those
# builds a FrameConfig in C++ and hands it straight to the encoder. None of
# them goes through argv. So `search=distortion` could stop being parsed,
# stop reaching plan::Tools, or be silently dropped for one of the two
# commands, and the whole quality suite would still pass - the flag would just
# quietly do nothing for every user who typed it.
#
# Hence the "differs" half below: it is the only check in the repository that
# the CLI argument reaches the encoder at all.
#
# WHY THE FLOOR IS NOT THE ENCODER'S OWN 0.05 dB. eac3_frame.cpp and
# encoder.cpp both switch candidates on kCodeSwitchMarginDb = 0.05, and the
# unit tests assert `searched >= off - 0.05` against that. That margin is
# right for the frame-level comparison those tests make, and WRONG here: the
# search minimises its own per-frame reconstruction-error estimate, while this
# gate measures delay-compensated SNR over a whole file after a real decode.
# Related, not identical. Measured across every CI leg and every trend leg,
# both scoring paths, the worst end-to-end delta is -0.150 dB (E-AC-3 stereo
# `auto` at 192, FFmpeg-decoded) - three times the frame-level margin, on an
# encoder that is behaving correctly. A gate at 0.05 would have failed on the
# day it landed.
#
# -0.5 dB is that worst observed case with 3.3x of headroom. It is a tripwire
# for "the search started making things worse", not a tightness contest: a
# real regression here is multiple dB, which the same measurement run showed
# directly - AC-3 5.1 at 448 with search=perceptual (a criterion that
# deliberately trades SNR for masking) lands at -3.3 dB, twenty times the
# noise this floor allows for and something this gate would catch instantly.
CI_SEARCH_MIN_DELTA_DB = -0.5

# Deliberately NOT a positive floor, though the measurement invites one: the
# same run showed search=distortion earning +1.24 dB on AC-3 5.1 at 448 and
# +0.48 dB on AC-3 stereo at 192, so "the search must still be worth
# something" looks gateable. It is not a good gate. The delta shrinks when the
# BASELINE improves, so a floor on it fails on exactly the changes worth
# making. The benefit is printed on every run instead - visible to a reader,
# never blocking - and the no-op case it would have caught is already covered
# by the differs check, which does not care how large the win is.

# synthetic legs are NOT retired - their series go back to the first
# baseline, and breaking that continuity to swap material would throw away
# the history the landscape page exists to show.
#
# Second, rates where the Annex E tools actually run. `auto` turns coupling on
# below 12 + 14n kbit/s per channel and spectral extension below 56 (see
# eac3_frame.cpp's coupling_rate_ceiling/kSpxRateCeiling), and the only stereo
# leg sat at 192 kbit/s - 96 per channel, above both - so `auto` chose no
# tools at all there and the landscape never once compared this project's
# Annex E work against FFmpeg's or DEE's at a rate where it exists. The two
# stereo legs added here bracket both crossovers: 96 kbit/s is 48 per channel
# (spectral extension on, coupling off - it isolates spx) and 64 kbit/s is 32
# per channel (both on). The 5.1 legs already sat below both ceilings at
# 256 kbit/s, which is why no low-rate 5.1 leg is added.

# The only quality series this project has for its OBJECT layer. Every codec
# layer beside it - AC-3, E-AC-3, and each Annex E tool - has a per-commit
# trend row; object reconstruction had exactly one measurement anywhere in
# the tree, libs/ac3/tests/oba/test_atmos.cpp's `snr_db > 10.0` against 18-35 dB
# measured, so a 10-20 dB JOC regression passed CI and appeared on no page.
#
# The loop is the one that unit test runs, moved out to the CLI and to a
# committed scene: encode testdata/audio/reference_objects.wav (five mono
# object essences as WAV channels) with `atmos-encode`, driven by the
# committed placements in reference_objects.paths, then decode with
# `decode <stream> <bed> <objects_dir>` and score each exported object_NN.wav
# against the source channel it came from. tools/generators/gen_object_scene_wav.py
# generates both committed files and documents the scene.
#
# THERE IS NO EXTERNAL ORACLE FOR OBJECT DECODE AT ALL - a weaker position
# than even ecpl/tpn are in (see decode_scores_ours' docstring). FFmpeg has no
# JOC reconstruction at all, and Dolby's own decoder gates object decoding on
# a keyed authenticity tag this project ships no key for (docs/concepts/
# atmos-joc.md), so it plays these streams as their 5.1 bed and never
# produces objects to compare against. This is a pure self-consistency
# series: this project's own encoder and decoder share one reading of TS 103
# 420, so a genuine regression in either still collapses these numbers, and a
# defect both sides agree on is invisible here. docs/object-quality-trend.md
# says exactly that on the page itself.

    hold nothing but the reference's own numerical floor, and any leakage

    ~zero. Run unmodified, that reports this scene's objects at 10-38 dB
    "log-spectral distance", which is a true statement about band ratios and

    exists for exactly this reason one axis over (it drops near-silent

              specific to object coding: the audible failure of a JOC
              reconstruction is another object's content arriving in this
              one, and for well-separated objects that lands where this
              object has no content of its own. Lower is better. None - not
              a large negative number - for an object that occupies every
