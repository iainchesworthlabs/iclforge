"""Unit tests for check_hearth_package.py, the Hearth package gate.

stdlib `unittest`, not pytest, for the reason test_write_measurement_badges.py
gives: this runs in ci.yml's script-lint job, which installs nothing beyond
its linters, and the script under test is stdlib-only itself.

The rules this file holds down are the content rules: the gate reads
NOTICES.txt rather than only listing it, because the ways a notices file goes
wrong leave every file name in place. Hearth's Qt section (apps/hearth/
notices/notices.cmake) is present with a filled version and source URL only
where the package bundles Qt (Windows, macOS - the gap PR #816 fixed) and
absent on Linux, which links the system's own Qt; the five vcpkg-sourced
third-party sections (cpp-httplib, Mbed TLS, mdns, libFLAC, Opus) can each
go quietly wrong the same way Crucible's Qt version can - a version token
that substituted to nothing - without any file name going missing.
test_good_shapes_pass guards the existing name checks against a refactor,
and two more guard the rules that are negatives, both currently unreachable
from a real build and asserted anyway (see check_hearth_package.py's own
module docstring): no part of Qt's test module is in the package
(test_windows_zip_must_not_carry_qt_test, test_macos_zip_must_not_carry_qt_test).
test_dispatch_is_by_bundle_content_not_filename guards the thing that tells a
macOS archive from a Windows one in the first place - both are
iclforge-hearth-<version>-<system>.zip alike, so main() has to look inside.

Run: python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/ci -p 'test_*.py'
