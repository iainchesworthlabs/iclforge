"""Append one CI run's external-encoder landscape scores to the
quality-history branch's per-branch JSONL file, and flag a trailing-baseline
regression at two tiers: a soft one (::warning::, never fails this script)
and a hard one (::error::, signalled via $GITHUB_OUTPUT's hard_regression so
the caller can fail the job *after* still committing and pushing the data -
same reasoning as append_quality_history.py/append_performance_history.py's
identical two-tier design, and the same "commit first, fail the job after"
ordering so a regression is never silently un-recorded just because it also
failed the run).

Reads tools/ci/quality_race.py's `trend` mode JSON output (one row per
(leg, variant) for THIS build, scored entirely through forge's own
decoder - see race_trend's docstring) plus the checked-in
testdata/external-baseline/manifest.json (the FFmpeg/DEE numbers from
tools/generators/gen_external_baseline.py's last local run), and appends one JSONL
record per row to <history-dir>/external-comparison-<branch>.jsonl. Only
"landscape" rows (E-AC-3's "auto"/AC-3's automatic tools - the number
actually comparable to FFmpeg's/DEE's own black-box output) get vs_ffmpeg/
vs_dee deltas; the per-tool detail rows (EAC3_VARIANTS/EAC3_SELF_VARIANTS)
have no matching external number to compare against, so those keys are
simply absent rather than null-padded. A leg's DEE score can itself be
{"status": "unverified", ...} in the manifest (see
tools/generators/gen_external_baseline.py's UNVERIFIED_DEE_LEGS) - vs_dee_snr_db is
omitted for those rather than comparing against a number that was never
real. No leg is unverified at baseline_version 2, but the handling stays:
the next external-tool release is as likely to need it as the last one was.

Mirrors tools/ci/append_quality_history.py closely by design (same shape,
same trailing-10-run window, same regression thresholds - the underlying
metric is the same kind of dB-scale SNR number). This only runs on
main pushes (mirrors persist_quality_trend's own gating) and only
after tools/ci/quality_race.py's `ci` gate has already passed on the same
push, so what lands in history is never a broken run's numbers.

Also carries through each row's "mos_lqo" (ViSQOL MOS-LQO, see
quality_race.py's perceptual_score()) when the environment that produced
trend.json had `visqol-python` installed - null otherwise, same graceful-
degradation contract as everywhere else this project uses it. Since CI now
installs it, that column has a trailing-window regression tier of its own -
soft only, never a job failure; see MOS_REGRESSION_DROP for why it is not
symmetric with the SNR tiers. lsd_db/hf_db stay read-only here: each is a
measure of a specific trade the Annex E tools make on purpose, so a move in
either is not on its own a regression the way a MOS drop is.

`landscape` rows carry a vs_ffmpeg/vs_dee delta for all three of the
metrics that have one on both sides - snr_db, lsd_db and mos_lqo - so the
comparison can be read on more than waveform SNR alone. These tools trade
waveform fidelity for banded envelope fidelity on purpose, and a single-
metric headline reports that trade as a straight loss. Each delta appears
only when *both* sides have a real number: mos_lqo is absent from every
baseline generated before version 2, which was the first produced in an
environment that had visqol-python installed, and lsd_db is null on the AC-3
legs, where race_trend does not score it at all.

Every vs_* key is ours-minus-theirs, including the LSD one where lower is
better - the arithmetic stays uniform and the presentation layer decides
which direction is good.

stdlib-only (json/argparse/pathlib), matching every other append-*.py
script's no-new-CI-provisioning reasoning. Takes commit and commit-date as
arguments rather than reading the clock itself - see this project's general
rule against Date.now()-style nondeterminism in tooling; the caller sources
commit-date from `git show -s --format=%cI`.
