"""Classify a change's file list into CI lanes (roadmap: CI lane partitions).

`ci.yml`'s `changes` job already tells a docs-only PR from a code one so the
split platform builds can be skipped (`docs_re`, right above the step this
script is called from). This is the next cut of that same idea: which
*lanes* - core library, each platform, each satellite toolchain - actually
need to run, so a Windows-only change stops paying for ESP-IDF and Android.

    gh api --paginate "repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/files" --jq '.[].filename' \\
      | python3 tools/ci/classify_changes.py >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

    python3 tools/ci/classify_changes.py --force-all >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

    ... | python3 tools/ci/classify_changes.py --satellites-direct >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

Reads one path per line from stdin (repo-relative, the same shape `gh api
... --jq '.[].filename'` already produces) and prints `<lane>=true` or
`<lane>=false` for every lane, one per line - ready to append straight to
`$GITHUB_OUTPUT`, the same convention the `code` output next to it uses.
`--force-all` skips stdin entirely and marks every lane true, for `push` to
`main` and `merge_group`: a queued or direct-to-main run has no single PR
diff to read against, and the merge queue's whole point is catching what an
individual PR's own lane subset could not see.

`ci.yml` consumes these outputs to gate the core workflow, split platform
workflows, satellites and package workflows. See docs/ci-lanes.md for the
mapping, the fan-out rule, and why an unrecognised path lights every lane
rather than none of them.
