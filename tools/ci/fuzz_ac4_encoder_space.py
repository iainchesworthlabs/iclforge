"""Property/fuzz harness over the AC-4 encoder's input space.

The question tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py asks of AC-3's `encode` and
tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py of `eac3-encode`, asked of `ac4-encode`:
driven across its configuration space by adversarial but valid audio, does the
encoder ever write a stream a reader disagrees with, or refuse, crash or
misframe something it should have encoded? planning/ac4.md, the encoder's
ladder, item 7.

The PCM comes from the AC-3 harness's generator, imported rather than copied:
its per-block plan, the `cliff` profile and the correlation modes serve every
codec. The configuration space is this encoder's: mono, stereo, 5.0 and 5.1,
7.0 and 7.1 in the three 7.X layouts, and in a case in eight the immersive
layouts, 5.0.4 and 5.1.4, 7.0.4 and 7.1.4 with experimental=back-pair, and 9.0.4
and 9.1.4 with experimental=nine-x-4, in the codec mode the rate picks or SCPL,
ASPX_SCPL, ASPX_ACPL_2, ASPX_ACPL_1 (with experimental=acpl) or ASPX_AJCC (with
experimental=ajcc, but for 9.X.4) forced, with the height downmix now and then
(but for 9.X.4);
48 kHz at every frame rate of Part 1
Table 83 or 44.1 kHz at the native one, a rate from 8 kbps up (20 in 5.X and
7.X), constant, average or variable, the codec mode the rate picks, SIMPLE or
ASPX forced, or an A-CPL mode forced (ASPX_ACPL_2 and ASPX_ACPL_3 in 5.X, and
with experimental=acpl ASPX_ACPL_1 there and both in stereo), the experimental
tools, I-frames at an interval, at named frames and at fragment starts, the
metadata (dialnorm, the further loudness values, DRC's modes with their
profiles and with experimental gains, the downmix values, and dialogue
enhancement from marked channels or a stem by each method), and raw or MP4
output. A case in five also has several substreams and the presentations of
Part 2 Table 53 that play them (substreamN= and presentationN=): music and
effects with dialogue, main audio with associated audio, main audio whose
hybrid dialogue enhancement's waveform has a substream of its own, the three
together, roles by content classifier, one presentation per substream, and
now and then one of EMDF payloads alone; with languages, classifiers, rate
shares, dialogue mixing values, group gains, the associated audio's mixing
values, ids, levels, names and payloads drawn for them.

Each case is held to:

  traces   the encoder's own trace of what it wrote (`ac4-encode ...
           syntax-trace=`), the decoder's trace of what it read (`decode ...
           syntax-trace=`) and tools/references/ac4_syntax.py's trace of the
           stream are the same, record for record, and the Python parser reads
           every substream to its end with its invariants holding - the
           ladder's item 1;
  framing  the stream's sync frames, walked here from the sync word and
           frame_size alone, tile the file exactly, each with its CRC (Part 2
           Annex G, computed here), and FFmpeg's raw AC-4 demuxer finds as many
           packets as the encoder wrote frames, each the size of its raw frame;
           the MP4 output's track is one AC-4 stream FFmpeg's mov demuxer reads
           with that many samples - item 3's FFmpeg half;
  decode   `forge decode` reads it to PCM: every frame, at the input's
           channel count and sample rate, the frames' lengths adding up to
           what the frame rate gives that many frames (Part 2 clause 5.11),
           and the output covering the input delayed by the lag ac4-encode
           reports, with no more than a frame to spare. With several
           substreams it decodes the first presentation, which plays the
           input's substream with others that add no channel to it.

A configuration outside the encoder's range - a rate below 8 or above 3000
kbps, or at 44.1 kHz a frame rate other than the native one - must be refused
with the encoder's own message, and is drawn on purpose now and then.
--check-envelope re-measures that range.

Every case is a pure function of one 64-bit case seed, printed with any
failure; --replay reruns it, and REGRESSION_SEEDS holds the seeds that ever
failed, replayed by --regressions.
