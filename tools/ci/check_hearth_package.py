"""Assert the Hearth package carries a window that can start,
and the notices for what it ships.

The archive cpack produces for the `hearth` component (cmake/Packaging.cmake)
is Hearth's release asset - the desktop reference player
(planning/hearth-reference-player.md, phase A7). Its failure mode is not an
empty file - it is a plausible-looking archive holding hearth.exe with no
Qt beside it, which installs and then does not start, because the Qt deploy
script (apps/hearth/ui/CMakeLists.txt) was filed under the wrong CPack
component or did not run. That is what this checks, from CI
(.github/workflows/_ci-windows.yml, _ci-macos.yml, _ci-linux.yml) and from a
local `cpack --preset pack-windows-msvc` run just the same:

    python tools/ci/check_hearth_package.py packages/iclforge-hearth-*.zip
    python tools/ci/check_hearth_package.py packages/iclforge-hearth-*-Linux-*.tar.gz
    python tools/ci/check_hearth_package.py packages/iclforge-hearth-*-Darwin.zip

The layout it expects is the one qt_generate_deploy_qml_app_script()
produces - the same mechanism apps/crucible uses and
tools/ci/check_crucible_package.py already checks: on Windows, the binary in
bin/ beside a qt.conf whose `Prefix = ..` sends Qt to the sibling plugins/,
qml/ and translations/ directories; on macOS, Qt deployed inside
hearth.app itself (Contents/Frameworks/, Contents/PlugIns/ and
Contents/Resources/qml/).

The second thing it checks is the content of NOTICES.txt
(notices/hearth/notices.cmake). Hearth's notices are simpler than
Crucible's - no driver, no Quick 3D room, no platform that gets its own
extra third-party library - but carry the same failure mode: a file whose Qt
section is missing where the platform bundles Qt (Windows, macOS - a Qt
LGPL-compliance gap PR #816 fixed once already) or present where it does not
(Linux, which links the system's Qt and ships none), or whose cpp-httplib/
Mbed TLS/mdns/libFLAC/Opus/Sendspin-time-filter sections exist but carry an
unfilled version because the vcpkg SPDX lookup that fills them silently
returned nothing.

The third is a negative, forward-looking rather than presently exercised:
apps/hearth/ui/CMakeLists.txt runs no StripQtTestDeployment pass yet, because
there is no hearth_qmltests target for Qt's qmlimportscanner to pull
QtTest in for (see that file's own comment). apps/crucible/CMakeLists.txt hit
exactly this leak once qmlimportscanner had a tst_*.qml to find, and
cmake/StripQtTestDeployment.cmake is what removes it there - see
check_crucible_package.py's own comment on FORBIDDEN_WINDOWS_QT_TEST_QML for
the mechanism. Hearth runs no such pass yet because it has nothing yet to
strip; this is asserted anyway, now, so the day a qmltests target lands (the
same windeployqt-chain comment in apps/hearth/ui/CMakeLists.txt that already
expects it), this check is already watching rather than something an audit
discovers later.
