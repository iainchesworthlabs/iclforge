"""Unit tests for check_crucible_package.py, the Crucible package gate.

stdlib `unittest`, not pytest, for the reason test_write_measurement_badges.py
gives: this runs in ci.yml's script-lint job, which installs nothing beyond
its linters, and the script under test is stdlib-only itself.

The rules this file holds down are the content rules: the gate reads
NOTICES.txt rather than only listing it, because the ways a notices file goes
wrong leave every file name in place. A notices file assembled from the other
platform's component list (notices/crucible/platform/<os>/) still
appears as NOTICES.txt; so does one whose Qt Quick 3D section is missing while
qml/QtQuick3D/ shipped, or present while it did not. Each case here builds
the smallest archive that has the right shape and the wrong words, and
asserts the gate refuses it and says why. test_good_shapes_pass guards the
existing name checks against the same refactor, and two more guard the rules
that are negatives: the driver is not in the package
(test_windows_zip_must_not_carry_a_driver_inf) and neither is any part of Qt's
test module (test_windows_zip_must_not_carry_qt_test). Both of those exist to
go red on the day their subject comes back.
test_macos_zip_must_not_carry_a_driver_script and
test_macos_zip_must_not_carry_qt_test are the same two rules again for the
macOS bundle shape, and test_dispatch_is_by_bundle_content_not_filename guards
the thing that tells a macOS archive from a Windows one in the first place -
both are iclforge-crucible-<version>-<system>.zip alike, so main() has to look
inside.
