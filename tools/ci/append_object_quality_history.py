"""Append one CI run's object-reconstruction scores to the quality-history
branch's per-branch JSONL file, and flag a trailing-baseline regression at
two tiers: a soft one (::warning::, never fails this script) and a hard one
(::error::, signalled via $GITHUB_OUTPUT's hard_regression so the caller can
fail the job *after* still committing and pushing the data - the same
"commit first, fail the job after" ordering as append_quality_history.py,
append_performance_history.py and append_external_comparison_history.py, so
a regression is never silently un-recorded just because it also failed the
run).

Reads tools/ci/quality_race.py's `objects` mode JSON output - one row per
(leg, object) plus a `scene` row per leg, every number produced by encoding
the committed testdata/audio/reference_objects.wav scene with this build
and decoding it back with this build - and appends one JSONL record per row
to <history-dir>/object-quality-<branch>.jsonl.

There is no external-baseline half here, and there cannot be one. The three
codec legs append_external_comparison_history.py handles carry vs_ffmpeg/
vs_dee deltas against testdata/external-baseline/manifest.json; object
decode has no external oracle at all - FFmpeg implements no JOC
reconstruction, and Dolby's own decoder gates object decoding on a keyed
authenticity tag this project ships no key for, so it renders these streams
as their 5.1 bed and never produces objects to compare against. This series
is self-consistency only, which is why it takes no --manifest-json argument
and writes no vs_* keys. docs/object-quality-trend.md says so on the page.

Thresholds are this metric's own, not a copy of the codec legs'. The
existing series score 21-40 dB and use 0.5 dB soft / 10 dB hard; the object
rows sit at 9.6-22.7 dB across the two rates, so a 10 dB hard threshold
would be most of a healthy row's whole headroom. 5 dB is the hard tier here
- still far more than any legitimate encoder change moves a row, and still
well inside what a real JOC regression costs: the object-reconstruction
defect class this exists to catch collapses a row toward 0 dB, not by a
fraction of one. The soft tier stays 0.5 dB, which is a trend annotation
rather than a failure either way.

`leak_db` can legitimately be null on a row - an object occupying every Bark
band has nowhere outside for anything to leak into, so there is no
measurement rather than a floor value (see object_spectral_scores). It is
carried through as-is, read-only, with no regression handling, exactly as
lsd_db and mos_lqo are on the external-comparison series.

stdlib-only (json/argparse/pathlib), matching every other append-*.py
script's no-new-CI-provisioning reasoning. Takes commit and commit-date as
arguments rather than reading the clock itself - see this project's general
rule against Date.now()-style nondeterminism in tooling; the caller sources
commit-date from `git show -s --format=%cI`.
