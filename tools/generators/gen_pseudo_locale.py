"""Generate forge-gui's pseudo-locale QA fixture from a real lupdate extraction.

GUI localisation needs a "stub locale that proves the [translation] pipeline works
end to end" without requiring an actual translation. A hand-picked handful of
decorated strings would only prove the mechanism for the strings someone
remembered to decorate; this generator instead pseudo-localizes EVERY message
lupdate finds, mechanically, so the fixture is complete by construction and
catches something a partial real translation cannot: a user-visible string
that bypasses qsTr() entirely never gets decorated, so it stands out in a
screenshot or a test assertion exactly because it looks unmodified.

The transform (per <source>, applied to every <translation>, including ones
already marked type="unfinished" - unfinished is a completeness state that
means nothing for a fixture defined to be 100% synthetic):
  1. Accent every vowel (a->à, e->é, ...) so the string reads as
     "foreign" at a glance without changing its meaning or length.
  2. Pad the end with a bracketed run of filler characters sized to ~40% of
     the original length, the standard pseudo-localization technique for
     surfacing truncation/overflow in fixed-width UI - exactly the kind of
     bug a real, shorter translation would hide until it happened to land on
     a long phrase.
  3. Wrap the whole thing in [...] so a decorated string is unmistakable even
     before reading it closely.
Qt placeholders (%1, %2, ..., %L1) and the numerus %n are left untouched -
mangling one would break the very string it is meant to protect, and a real
translation would leave them alone too.

Run after regenerating the real catalog (regenerating this fixture is a
separate, explicit step - see docs/forge/gui/localisation.md - not part of the
default build, since apps/forge/gui/assets/translations/forge_gui_xx.ts is committed, static
input to forge_gui_qmltests):

    cmake --build <preset> --target forge-gui_lupdate
    python tools/generators/gen_pseudo_locale.py

It reads apps/forge/gui/assets/translations/forge_gui_fr.ts purely as a source of TRUTH for
which messages currently exist (any one of the six real .ts files would do -
lupdate scans the identical QML sources for all of them) and writes
apps/forge/gui/assets/translations/forge_gui_xx.ts from scratch with the same message set.
Deterministic: same input always produces the same output byte for byte.
