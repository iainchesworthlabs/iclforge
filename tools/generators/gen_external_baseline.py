"""Local-only reference baseline vs FFmpeg's and Dolby DEE's encoders.

This is the one-time (or occasional) step that produces the checked-in
numbers CI's `quality_race.py trend` mode compares every build against.
DEE (Dolby Encoding Engine, bundled in "Dolby Media Encoder" - not the
decode-only Dolby Reference Player used elsewhere) is licensed commercial
software and must never run unattended in CI; FFmpeg's *encoder* is open
but is likewise kept out of the per-commit path so a build never depends on
either tool being present. Run this locally, review the manifest diff it
produces, commit it.

Each score also carries a MOS-LQO prediction (score_tool(), via
quality_race.py's perceptual_score()/ViSQOL) when `visqol-python` is
installed in the environment this runs in - "mos_lqo": null in the manifest
otherwise, same graceful-degradation contract as everywhere else this
project uses it. Installing it here is a one-time, local, opt-in choice by
whoever regenerates the baseline; it is never required to run this script.

Eight fixed legs (baseline_version 2; the first three were the whole set at
version 1 and are unchanged, so their published series stay continuous):

  ac3-51-448             AC-3,   5.1,    448 kbps, reference_51.wav
  eac3-stereo-192        E-AC-3, stereo, 192 kbps, reference_stereo.wav
  eac3-51-256            E-AC-3, 5.1,    256 kbps, reference_51.wav
  eac3-stereo-96         E-AC-3, stereo,  96 kbps, reference_stereo.wav
  eac3-stereo-64         E-AC-3, stereo,  64 kbps, reference_stereo.wav
  ac3-music-stereo-192   AC-3,   stereo, 192 kbps, programme_music_stereo.flac
  eac3-music-stereo-96   E-AC-3, stereo,  96 kbps, programme_music_stereo.flac
  eac3-speech-stereo-64  E-AC-3, stereo,  64 kbps, programme_speech_stereo.flac

The two new synthetic stereo legs exist because the Annex E tools were never
being compared against FFmpeg or DEE at a rate where they run. `auto` enables
coupling below 12 + 14n kbit/s per channel and spectral extension below 56
(eac3_frame.cpp's coupling_rate_ceiling/kSpxRateCeiling), and the only stereo
leg sat at 96 per channel - above both - so every published stereo comparison
was of an encoder that had chosen no tools at all. 96 kbps total is 48 per
channel (spectral extension only) and 64 is 32 (both).

The three programme legs are the other half of the same problem: the first
five are all 2.5-3 s of sin()/noise/FIR, which carries a flat noise plateau
across its whole top octave and has already produced one measured, fake
2.1 dB "win" (libs/ac3/src/encoder/encoder.cpp's chbwcod comment). See
tools/generators/gen_programme_fixtures.py for the sources, licences and
measured spectra. Those fixtures ship as FLAC and are materialised to WAV
under build/ by quality_race.py's materialise_fixture(), which is what the
`wav` key below goes through.

For each leg: encode with FFmpeg, encode with DEE, encode with the current
build's forge (a sanity check, not the point of this script - CI's `trend`
mode re-encodes with whatever build is under test).

Scoring decodes FFmpeg's and DEE's output with FFmpeg's own decoder (its
established role everywhere else in this project - see decode_scores'
"neutral referee" docstring), and forge's own output with forge's own
decoder (self-consistency, the same pattern decode_scores_ours uses
elsewhere). This is a deliberate change from decoding every bitstream with
forge's own decoder: FFmpeg's encoder turns out to legally choose Table
E2.12's default coupling band structure (cplbndstrce=0), which this
project's own decoder declines to read (eac3_decoder.cpp - no stream this
project's own encoder produces ever sets that flag, so it was never
exercised against one that does - see the tracked follow-up to fix this and
add CI coverage decoding real third-party output). Scoring external
encoders' output by how well *our* decoder happens to parse their bitstream
choices would also conflate their encoder's quality with our decoder's
coverage - using FFmpeg for both avoids that confound entirely, not just
the crash. (The Dolby Reference Player was also tried here, as a genuine
reference-implementation oracle, and appeared to decode DEE's own E-AC-3
stereo output to near-total garbage while FFmpeg decoded the identical file
to a sane score. That has since been run down and it is not a decode defect
at all - see "Resolved" below.)

Writes testdata/external-baseline/<leg>/{ffmpeg,dee}.<ac3|ec3> (the raw
bitstreams, committed) and one testdata/external-baseline/manifest.json
(the numbers CI reads). Bump BASELINE_VERSION by hand before rerunning this
to regenerate the baseline against a new DEE/FFmpeg release - it is the
only marker distinguishing one baseline generation from the next in a PR
diff.

Resolved at baseline_version 2: DEE's two 5.1 legs used to score as
"unverified" rather than a number. This installed DEE build
(v6.5.4-dme+b56bc97e) reproducibly drops the Ls (surround-left) channel's
content when 5.1 arrives as ONE discrete 6-channel file, confirmed with a
per-channel tone probe: the silence was locked to channel index 3 whatever
content was placed there, independent of WAV-vs-raw-PCM input, dd-vs-ddp
codec, and the surround_90deg_phase_shift flag.

The fix is DEE's other documented input path. `--input-format wav_list`
takes one mono WAV per channel ("A list of mono WAVE files, one for each
channel, in order of L:R:C:LFE:LS:RS:LRS:RRS", per `dee_ddp_encoder
--morehelp input-format`) and does not lose Ls. Verified by re-measuring
per-channel RMS through the full encode/decode: 6983/6983/3146/7282/700/1151
out against 7025/7025/3165/7517/717/1174 in, every channel present including
index 4. That list order is also this project's own WAV channel order
(FL FR FC LFE BL BR - iclforge::ac3::io::ac3_layout_for), unlike the SMPTE order the
single-multichannel path wants, so split_for_dee() below needs no
permutation at all where reorder_for_dee() needed _SMPTE_FROM_WAVE_51. The
single-file path is gone rather than kept as a fallback: it is the one that
loses a channel.

Two of DEE's own production defaults had to come off at the same time, for
the same reason `measure_only`/`drc_profile=none` were already off - see
_DEE_ENCODER_OPTS for the measured cost of each. The surround one is worth
knowing about generally: DEE phase-shifts Ls/Rs by 90 degrees by default,
which preserves their magnitude spectrum exactly and decorrelates their
waveform completely. A per-channel RMS check passes; SNR reads -2.9 dB. That
is a failure mode that looks like a dropped channel from one angle and like
a broken encoder from another, and is neither.

Still unverified for DEE: both 64 kbit/s stereo legs, because DEE's stereo
Dolby Digital Plus data rate starts at 96 - see UNVERIFIED_DEE_LEGS.

Known issue: FFmpeg cannot decode the FIRST frame of DEE's stereo E-AC-3
stream from cold, which is why eac3-stereo-192's DEE entry carries a
"decoder_note" (see DECODER_NOTES below). FFmpeg 8.0.1 reads 93 of that
stream's 94 frames cleanly - a median 44 dB per frame - and fails only frame
0, reporting "exponent 25 is out-of-range" once and concealing it by
repeating block 0 across blocks 1-4. It is the frame's own shape that FFmpeg
cannot read cold, not its position: frames 0, 75 and 89 share a payload
shape, all three fail when made the first frame, and frame 0 decodes with no
error at all when any other frame is prepended ahead of it. Frames 75 and 89
therefore decode correctly in place, at 51.0 and 42.9 dB, because by then
there is decoder state to fall back on.

This does not move the number recorded here, and that is not a lucky
accident worth hiding: score_fixed aligns on FIXED_ALIGN, whose skip is
0.2 s, so the first 9600 samples - the only ones FFmpeg gets wrong - are
outside the scored window for every leg alike. Scored across the whole file
instead, FFmpeg's decode of this fixture is 14.30 dB rather than 33.32 dB,
and the entire difference is that one frame. The reason the 33.32 dB is
nonetheless the right number for DEE's ENCODER is independent corroboration,
not the window: iclforge's own decoder reads frame 0 correctly (42.30 dB on
it) and scores the same fixture 33.3236 dB through the same window - 0.005 dB
from FFmpeg's 33.3186 dB. Two independent decoders agreeing that closely is
what says this measures DEE's encoder rather than either decoder's
concealment. (That cross-check needs the Annex E decoder fixes that arrive
with the third-party interop gate, PR #320 - before them this project's own
decoder could not read DEE's Annex E syntax at all, which is why no earlier
baseline run could have made this comparison.)

Resolved: the Dolby Reference Player's apparent "near-total garbage" on this
same stereo stream, noted above and left open until now, is a level shift
and not a decode defect. DEE writes a MEASURED dialnorm of 12 (dialogue at
-12 dBFS) because invoke_dee asks for loudness-management measure_only; the
reference player then does what a player is supposed to do and normalises
dialogue to -31 dBFS, attenuating the output by exactly 31 - 12 = 19 dB.
Neither FFmpeg's decoder nor forge's applies dialnorm, and the scoring here
compares against an un-normalised source WAV, so the player's output scored
1.02 dB. Undo that 19 dB and the same decode scores 32.19 dB, with an
LSD of 1.878 sitting between FFmpeg's 1.899 and forge's 1.857 - a good
decode all along. FFmpeg's own encoder writes dialnorm 31, a 0 dB shift,
which is the only reason its stream looked fine through the same pipeline.
The player is therefore usable as an oracle, provided dialnorm is either
compensated for or encoded as 31.

Usage (repo root, after building forge):  python tools/generators/gen_external_baseline.py
Set ICLFORGE_CLI to override the forge binary, same as quality_race.py.

The wider set of DEE's AC-3, E-AC-3, E-AC-3 JOC and TrueHD streams, every layout, rate and
metadata option DEE takes, kept on a local disk and never committed, is
tools/generators/gen_dee_gold.py's.

    established "neutral referee" role elsewhere in this project).

    The Dolby Reference Player (dolby_decode) was tried here too, since it
    is a genuine reference-implementation oracle when it works, and appeared
    to produce near-total garbage (1.02 dB SNR) decoding DEE's own E-AC-3
    stereo output while FFmpeg decoded the identical file to ~33 dB. It is
    not a "decoder", though: it is a PLAYER, and it applies dialnorm. DEE
    writes a measured dialnorm of 12 on that stream, so the player correctly
    attenuates by 31 - 12 = 19 dB, and scoring its output against an
    un-normalised source WAV charges the whole 19 dB to the decode. Undo it
    and the same decode scores 32.19 dB. FFmpeg is not "better" here, only
    dialnorm-blind, and FFmpeg's own encoder writes dialnorm 31 (a 0 dB
    shift) which is why its stream looked fine either way. Kept on FFmpeg
    regardless, for the neutral-referee reason above rather than because the
    player cannot do it - but a caller that wants the player as an oracle has
    to compensate dialnorm or encode it as 31. See the module docstring.

    Requests a MOS-LQO score too (perceptual_score() in quality_race.py) -
    unlike lsd_db/hf_db it isn't gated on is_eac3, since ViSQOL scores
    perceived quality in general rather than a specific Annex E tool's
    banded envelope. None when visqol-python isn't installed, same
    graceful-degradation contract as everywhere else it's used - this
    script staying runnable without it matters here too, DEE alone is
    already the hard local-only requirement.
