"""Multi-object scene generator for the object-reconstruction quality leg.

Produces two checked-in files that together define one fixed Atmos scene:

  testdata/audio/reference_objects.wav    5 mono essences, one per object,
                                              as the channels of a 48 kHz PCM16
                                              WAV (`forge atmos-encode` makes
                                              each source channel an object)
  testdata/audio/reference_objects.paths  where each of those objects sits
                                              in the room, in atmos-path's own
                                              keyframe format

`tools/ci/quality_race.py`'s `objects` mode encodes the pair with
`atmos-encode`, decodes the result back to per-object WAVs with `decode
<stream> <bed> <objects_dir>`, and scores each object against the channel it
came from. Splitting the scene across two files is what makes that possible:
`atmos-encode`'s own default placement fans objects out evenly AND applies a
0.7/sqrt(N) headroom gain, so a reconstructed object comes back at its
intended level rather than the source's, and SNR against the source would be
measuring that deliberate level change rather than reconstruction quality.
The committed placements pin both, at unit gain.

Independent of iclforge's own encoder/decoder in the same sense as
tools/generators/gen_gold_reference_wav.py: built here from first principles
(sin()/pseudo-random noise/simple FIR smoothing), not bootstrapped by
decoding one of our own encodes.

The scene, borrowing its cast from examples/station_broadcast.cpp (a station
anthem, a comet, an engine, a work pod) because a scene of distinct diegetic
sources is exactly what a parametric object coder has to keep apart:

  0 broadcast  a chord-and-formant radio anthem, nailed front-centre
  1 comet      band-limited noise with a slow swell, drifting left to right
               across the scene - the one object that MOVES, so the leg
               scores the matrix's per-frame interpolation and not only its
               steady state
  2 engine     a low harmonic rumble with a slow tremolo, rear right
  3 pod-hi     a high whine cluster, rear left and overhead
  4 pod-lo     narrow-band chatter, rear left at floor level

3 and 4 are a direction-degenerate pair, and they are in the scene to probe
one specific thing. The bed has no height channels, so elevation costs
nothing in the downmix and two objects that differ only in height are panned
into the five bed channels identically - iclforge/ac3/oba/atmos.hpp's own module
comment names that as the limit of what JOC can do. Direction is not the
matrix's only axis, though: it solves per FREQUENCY BAND (AtmosConfig::
num_bands_idx, Table 50), so a pair that shares a direction but not a
spectrum is still separable, and this pair measured 22.7/22.0 dB at 448
kbit/s when it was built - as well as the well-separated objects. That is
what makes the two rows worth having: they are the scene's only objects
whose separation depends on band resolution ALONE, so a regression that
coarsened the banded solve would collapse exactly these two and leave the
rest of the scene reading normally. Deliberately not pushed to full spectral
overlap as well: that scores about -6 dB, where a further regression has no
room left to show, and a row pinned to the floor detects nothing.

Levels are chosen so the 5.1 downmix of all five objects at unit gain never
clips - `atmos-encode` prints a per-channel `clipped` column, and it must
read `-` on every channel for this fixture.

Stdlib-only (no numpy), same reasoning as gen_gold_reference_wav.py: this
runs once, locally, to produce the checked-in files, never in CI.
