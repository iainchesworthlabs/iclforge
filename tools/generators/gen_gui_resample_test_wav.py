"""44.1kHz reference WAV for the GUI's resample-on-load QML test.

Produces libs/base/fuzz/seeds/fuzz_wav_read/resample-44100.wav: a small, checked-in
stereo PCM16 WAV at 44100 Hz - deliberately a rate that does NOT match
roundtrip-stereo.wav/roundtrip-51.wav's 48000 Hz, since forge-gui's own
addSourceFile() only resamples a second source onto the primary's rate when
the two actually differ. tst_source_loading.qml loads this as the SECOND
source (after one of the 48kHz fixtures as primary) to exercise that path
end to end, checking the resampled row's "44.1->48 k" label and that the
tone survives at the right frequency (silence or a single short click would
give a false pass either way - see CONTRIBUTING.md's "test with real audio"
rule).

Two distinct, multi-cycle tones (one per channel) rather than one tone
duplicated on both, so a channel-mixup bug in the resample path would show
up as measuring the wrong frequency on the wrong channel. Comfortably below
full scale (PEAK below) so nothing here is about clipping - that is a
separate concern this fixture is not trying to cover.

Stdlib-only (no numpy): this only needs to run once, locally, to produce the
checked-in file - not in CI.
