"""Generates the Dolby Encoding Engine's AC-3, E-AC-3, E-AC-3 JOC and TrueHD golden masters: a
local set, never committed, beside the AC-4 gold set.

Why. DEE's licence here ends on 2026-11-06 and is not renewed, and after that date no DEE stream
of any kind can be made. What the tree takes from DEE today is small: the eight legs of
gen_external_baseline.py (testdata/external-baseline/, six of them DEE streams at 2.0 and 5.1),
which quality_race.py's trend and verify_gold_reference.sh's third-party legs read, and the one
DD+ JOC fixture of gen_object_fixture.py (testdata/object-fixture/dee_joc_514.ec3), which the
object layer's tests, Hearth and the ESP32 sink runs play. This set makes, while DEE runs, every
stream a later piece of work could want from it: each layout and data rate the AC-3, E-AC-3,
Blu-ray E-AC-3, E-AC-3 JOC and TrueHD encoders allow, their metadata, 60 s and 300 s programmes,
and the refusals, each from sources rebuilt from committed material.

Every AC-3 and E-AC-3 leg reads its source as a wav_list of mono WAVs, the path
gen_external_baseline.py found keeps every channel (the single multichannel WAV loses Ls on this
DEE build); the JOC legs read cbi_wav and the TrueHD legs a single WAV, both of which keep them. The
scoring legs switch off DEE's audio-altering defaults (loudness measured only, no 90-degree
surround phase shift, no LFE low-pass), as gen_external_baseline.py does; eac3-metadata and
ac3-metadata keep one leg with those defaults on. Legs whose options change the audio say so in
audio_altered.

Sources (g2_source_specs() describes each), rebuilt from the committed programme fixtures and
synthesised: 10 s unless named otherwise, 24-bit, at 48 kHz, and at 96 kHz for TrueHD (tones and
noise made at 96 kHz, music up-sampled by two); _16 copies rounded to 16 bits. One tone per
speaker (SPEAKER_HZ, the AC-4 gold set's frequencies), music beds cut from the music fixture,
film with the speech fixture in C, sweeps, pink noise from a splitmix64 counter, silence then
transients, stepped tones for DRC, and programmes of music with speech ducking it.

Each leg, in DIR/streams/<leg>, keeps DEE's command and log, the stream, MediaInfo's trace (for
legs up to 60 s, --Details=1 --ParseSpeed=1) and its summary, DEE's MP4 of every AC-3 and E-AC-3
stream, and leg.json, which lets a rerun reuse a stream whose command and sources are unchanged.
DIR/dee-gold-manifest.json holds each leg's group, what it is for, the command, the SHA-256s,
DEE's warnings and loudness measurement, forge probe's reading (substreams, metadata, the tools
each stream uses), what that forge's decode and FFmpeg's make of the stream, and for TrueHD
whether FFmpeg's decode equals the source sample for sample. A refused leg keeps DEE's message.

TrueHD. The roadmap keeps "TrueHD interoperability by black-box analysis of Dolby streams" out of
scope until the clean-room rule allows it. On 2026-09-26 the user decided these streams are test
inputs only: decoded, passed through and round-tripped, with no analysis of how Dolby's encoder
made them. Each TrueHD entry says so (TRUEHD_NOTE).

What DEE 6.5.4 could not be made to write is in the manifest's dee_cannot (DEE_CANNOT).
