"""Generates the Dolby Encoding Engine's AC-4 streams this project checks itself against.

Two sets, from the same legs and sources:

- The committed set: tests/golden/external-baseline/ac4-*/dee.ac4, ac4-manifest.json beside
  them, and each stream's syntax digest under tests/golden/ac4dec/. Short streams that CI reads.
- The gold set (--gold-set DIR): every stream the phases of planning/ac4.md need, kept on a
  local disk and never committed. Phase G0 of that plan made it and phase G1 added to it, both
  while the local DEE licence ran (it ends on 2026-11-06 and is not renewed, so no DEE stream
  can be made after that date).

What the streams are for. The decoder in src/ac4/src/decoder is checked against them: first its syntax,
read by two transcriptions whose traces must agree (tools/references/ac4_syntax.py writes the
committed digests; tests/ac4/decoder/test_ac4dec_syntax.cpp holds the decoder to them), then, from
phase D2 on, its PCM, scored against each stream's source. The encoder phases race against the
same streams. So every leg except ac4-stereo-64 is made with loudness measured and not
corrected: DEE's default (measure_and_correct) normalises to -24 LKFS and runs a -2 dBFS
true-peak limiter, which changes the audio in a way no gain fit undoes. DRC profiles and the
downmix settings are metadata; DEE applies neither to the audio.

Legs of the committed set (ac4 = dee_ac4_encoder.exe, ims = dee_ac4ims_encoder.exe):

  ac4-514-tones-768      ac4  tones_514          768  immersive SCPL; one tone per channel

ac4-stereo-64 is the version 1 leg and keeps its bytes: tests pin its frame count and its
MediaInfo-checked table of contents, so main() refuses to replace it. The codec mode depends
only on the layout and the data rate (a census of 119 DEE 6.5.4 encodes of 20 s material):
stereo is ASPX up to 144 kbps, with companding on at 48-96 and off at 128-144, and SIMPLE from
192; 5.1 is ASPX_ACPL_3 at 96, ASPX_ACPL_2 at 128-144, ASPX at 192-320 and SIMPLE from 384.
dee_ac4_encoder always writes frame_rate_index 13 (2048 samples) and has no frame-rate option,
so the other frame lengths come from dee_ac4ims_encoder's --target-fps.

ac4-51-drc-ltrt-192 carries per-device DRC profiles that differ (film_standard, speech for
headphones, music_light for home theatre) and the Lt/Rt preferred downmix with explicit mix
levels. dee_ac4ims_encoder's default mode is general, which sends advanced dialogue enhancement
data in the I-frames of the IMS legs.

Every IMS stream signals presentation_version 2 with channel_mode code 0b1111000, which TS
103 190-2 Table 56 maps to 7.0, and codes a channel_pair_element: walked as 7.0, 5.0 or 5.1, at
least every I-frame fails its substream size checks; walked as stereo, every frame ends
exactly (src/ac4/ERRATA.md, "presentation_version 2 is read as immersive stereo").

The three 5.1.4 legs (phase G1) are one tone per channel in each immersive codec mode DEE
writes, for the phases from D9 on. Both transcriptions read immersive_channel_element() since
phase D9, and these legs' digests are written with the others'.

Sources, rebuilt on every run from committed material, so any stream can be scored again. Cuts
of the committed programme fixtures (30 s each), SECONDS long (5 s for the committed set, 10 s
for the gold set), written as 24-bit PCM WAVs (format tag 1) into the scratch or gold
directory, never into the tree:

  music_20   programme_music_stereo.flac from 0 s.
  speech_20  programme_speech_stereo.flac from 0 s.
  music_51   L R C LFE Ls Rs. L/R are the music from 0 s; C is its mono mix from T s x 0.6;
             LFE is its mono mix from 0 s, low-passed at 120 Hz, x 0.8; Ls/Rs are the music
             from 2T s x 0.5, with T = max(5, SECONDS). No channel is a copy of another.
  film_51    The speech's mono mix from 0 s in C over music_51's bed, with L/R x 0.45, Ls/Rs x
             0.35 and the same LFE.
  music_514  (gold set only) music_51 and four top channels: Tfl/Tfr the music from SECONDS/2
             x 0.4, Tbl/Tbr the music from 3 SECONDS/2 x 0.3.
  tones_20, tones_51, tones_514
             One sine per channel at -20 dBFS, at frequencies no channel's shares with
             another's harmonics (TONE_HZ), for checking that each channel lands on its own
             speaker. The LFE's is 47 Hz.

The FLACs are decoded with ffmpeg, the route quality_race.py's materialise_fixture() takes.
The LFE is filtered with the linear-phase windowed-sinc low-pass of
tools/listening/gen_listening_stimuli.py. A mix peaking above 0.98 would be scaled down to
0.98; none of these does. Channel order is L R C LFE Ls Rs, and for 5.1.4 L R C LFE Ls Rs Tfl
Tfr Tbl Tbr, the SMPTE order dee_ac4_encoder's cbi_wav input names. The AC-4 encoders read a
single 6-channel WAV the same way as a wav_list of its channels (music_51 encoded both ways
gives byte-identical streams), unlike dee_ddp_encoder, which gen_external_baseline.py records
losing Ls from a single 6-channel WAV.

Manifest. baseline_version 5 (see BASELINE_VERSION). One entry per leg:

  encoder, source, output_channel_layout, bitrate_kbps, options
      What was encoded and how. options are the DEE arguments beyond input, output, layout and
      data rate; [] is DEE's defaults. The IMS encoder takes no layout argument; "IMS" names
      its immersive-stereo output. ac4-stereo-64 also keeps its version 1 source_wav.
  duration_s, source_sha256, size_bytes
      The source WAV's length and SHA-256, and the stream's size. The SHA-256 is of the WAV
      DEE encoded, so a scorer that rebuilds the source can check it has the same one.
  frame_count, frame_rate_index, frame_len_base
      Read from the bytes with tools/references/ac4_parse.py, which also requires every sync
      frame's CRC and table of contents to read. frame_len_base is TS 103 190-1 Table 83's,
      for 48 kHz.
  codec_mode, explicit_drc_curves, custom_downmix_data, de_parameters, advanced_de_data
      What tools/references/ac4_syntax.py's trace of every frame found (walked_by names it):
        codec_mode           the audio substream's *_codec_mode, the same in every frame.
        explicit_drc_curves  drc_compression_curve_flag set for some DRC decoder mode.
        custom_downmix_data  custom_dmx_data() in the presentation substream sets
                             b_stereo_dmx_coeff or b_cdmx_data_present in some frame.
        de_parameters        dialog_enhancement() sends de_par codewords in some frame.
        advanced_de_data     b_advanced_de_data_present set in some frame.
      LEGS states what the layout, rate and options must give; main() stops if a walk
      disagrees, before anything in the tree changes. de_parameters is not stated: it follows
      the dialogue DEE detects in the content.
  immersive_codec_mode, input_format (the 5.1.4 legs)
      immersive_codec_mode is TS 103 190-2 Table 73's immersive_codec_mode_code, as the trace
      records it: one bit for ASPX_AJCC, three for the others. input_format is the cbi_wav
      dee_ac4_encoder took the ten channels as.

The gold set (--gold-set DIR). DIR/sources holds the sources; DIR/streams/<leg> holds each
stream (dee.ac4, or dee.ec3 and dee.ac3 for G1's E-AC-3 and AC-3 legs), DEE's log and output
manifest, MediaInfo's frame-by-frame trace (mediainfo-details.txt, from --Details=1) and summary
(mediainfo.json), and leg.json, which lets a rerun reuse a stream whose command and source have
not changed;
DIR/gold-manifest.json describes every leg as ac4-manifest.json does, with the stream's SHA-256
and each walk's diagnostics. G0's legs (gold_legs(), the manifest's "legs") are every layout
and rate dee_ac4_encoder writes, from 2.0 at 48 kbps to 5.1.4 at 768, for music, speech or
film, and tones; dee_ac4ims_encoder at every rate and frame rate; and metadata legs: each DRC
profile, the per-device profiles, each preferred downmix and some mix levels, I-frame
intervals, loudness presets, the height downmix, and the IMS encoder's DRC settings. Both
transcriptions refused 5.1.4's audio until phase D9, so the gold manifests G0 and G1 wrote
record its codec mode as null, and G1's its immersive_codec_mode beside it.

Objects (--adm-master WAV, repeatable, with --gold-set). dee_ac4ajoc_encoder accepts only an
Atmos master. Each master given is tried once with dee_ac4ajoc_encoder at levels 3 and 4 and
with dee_ac4ims_encoder; a refusal is recorded with DEE's message, not raised.

Phase G1 (gold_version 4, g1_legs()). A run over an existing gold set copies G0's legs, sources
and entries as they are, never rewrites a file of theirs, and writes the manifest by replacing
it whole. G1's legs go under the manifest's "g1_legs", beside "legs": the scorers that read
"legs" fail any leg they have not pinned, so a phase reads "g1_legs" when it pins what it needs
from them. Each G1 leg names its group and the phases it serves (G1_GROUPS):

                                   this project writes (--cli): refused, see below

G1's sources (g1_source_specs() describes each) are the same fixtures cut further: 7.1, 7.1.4
and 9.1.6 beds and tones (the back surrounds, wides and top middles take tones and music cuts of
their own), film and speech at 5.1.4, the synthetic signals, the presentation substreams,
stepped tones, and 60 s programmes, with -6 dB copies of the loud 5.1 sources for the immersive
stereo encoder, which levels input it measures above about -16 LKFS.

Besides what G0 keeps, each G1 leg keeps MediaInfo's trace with --ParseSpeed=1 (a table of
contents for every frame) and DEE's MP4 muxer's file (dee.mp4, with its log and MediaInfo's
summary), and its entry records the command, DEE's warnings and loudness measurement, every
SHA-256, the table of contents' channel modes, language tags and I-frames, and, with --cli,
what that forge's probe and decode made of the stream. G0's streams get their MP4 under
DIR/mp4/<leg>/. With --cli, the objects group builds its ADM BWF masters with that forge
(DIR/masters/<name>/, atmos-encode then decode's adm_out) and checks them with atmos_info.
Every AC-4 leg's syntax digest goes to <scratch>/census/, for the census comparison:
AC4DEC_GOLDEN_DIR=<scratch>/census AC4DEC_STREAM_DIR=DIR/streams iclforge-tests "[ac4dec][syntax]".

What DEE 6.5.4 could not be made to write (G1's audit, recorded in the manifest's g1_dee_cannot):
7.1 AC-4 (eight channels in come out as 5.1), 7.1.4 or 9.1.6 AC-4, any frame rate but index 13
from dee_ac4_encoder, several presentations, music and effects with dialogue, associated audio,
dialogue enhancement from a separate dialogue input, and any AC-4 from objects:
dee_ac4ajoc_encoder and dee_ac4ims_encoder take objects only from an Atmos master, and refuse
every master this project writes with "Content was not authored with Dolby tools", a provenance
check this project does not work around.
