"""Gold-reference WAV generator for the CI correctness gate.

Produces testdata/audio/reference_51.wav: a fixed, checked-in 5.1 PCM16
WAV, independent of iclforge's own encoder/decoder (it is built here from
first principles - sin()/pseudo-random noise/simple FIR smoothing - not
bootstrapped by decoding one of our own encodes the way
tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh's "bootstrap_51.wav" is). tools/checks/verify_gold_
reference.sh encodes this file with forge, strict-decodes the result with
FFmpeg, and compares that against forge's own decode - so a codec bug that
happens to round-trip cleanly against itself still gets caught here.

Deliberately not silence, not a single tone, and several seconds long (see
the project's own "silence and frame 0 give false passes" lesson) - every
channel carries genuinely different, decorrelated material so coupling,
rematrixing and the LFE path all see real signal.

Stdlib-only (no numpy): this only needs to run once, locally, to produce the
checked-in file - not in CI - but there is no reason to ask for a dependency
this simple content does not need.

Usage (repo root):  python tools/generators/gen_gold_reference_wav.py
