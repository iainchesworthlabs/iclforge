"""Generate the AC-4 Huffman codebooks, scale factor band tables, noise and QMF tables.

ETSI TS 103 190-1 V1.4.1 prints its Huffman codebooks only by name. Annex
A.0 says the lengths and codewords are in the accompanying
ts_10319001v010401p0.zip, whose ts_103190_tables.c holds a <name>_LEN and a
<name>_CW array for every codebook; that file is the normative table. Annex
A prints, per codebook, codebook_length and the cb_off, cb_mod, cb_mod2 and
cb_mod3 values the decoding process uses, and Tables A.14 (CB_DIM) and A.15
(UNSIGNED_CB). The attachment's Annex B section is empty, so Annex B's
tables are read from the text. ETSI TS 103 190-2 V1.3.1 does the same for
the A-JCC codebooks of its Annex A.1.2 (Tables A.13 to A.24) and the A-JOC
codebooks of its Annex A.1.1 (Tables A.1 to A.12), whose arrays are in
ts_10319002v010301p0.zip's ts_103190_tables_part2.c; they are generated
after Part 1's, as a sixth and a seventh clause.

                                         codebook tables.

The speech spectral frontend's tables (Annex C, clause 5.2) come the same way: C.1's
bandwidths from the text, and C.2 to C.14 and the 37 quantized prediction coefficient
matrices from the attachment (ssf_tables.hpp and .cpp), their sizes held to the
table_length the text prints, and the matrices' layout to the evidence in Pseudocode C.1's
note below.

Writes each header to src/ac4/src/core/tables/ and each source to
src/ac4/src/core/tables/: huffman_tables.hpp and .cpp (every Annex A
codebook, its entries sorted by length and then codeword, as
huffman_codebook.hpp's Codebook wants them for reading), huffman_codes.hpp and
.cpp (the same codebooks in index order, the codeword and its length for each
index, for writing), sfb_tables.hpp and .cpp (Annex
B at 44.1 and 48 kHz), noise_tables.hpp and .cpp (Annex C.11, which the
spectral noise fill of clause 5.1.4 reads through Pseudocode 57) and
qmf_tables.hpp and .cpp (Annex D.3, the QMF banks' window of clauses 5.7.3 and
5.7.4, and Annex D.2, A-SPX's noise generator table of clause 5.7.6.4.3) and
isf_tables.hpp and .cpp (Part 2 Annex A.2.1, the intermediate spatial format's
rendering matrices of Part 2 clause 5.10.3).
src/ac4core is what the AC-4 decoder and encoder share.

Checks, all of them before anything is written, every one failing the run:
  Huffman  Annex A names the same codebooks as the attachment, with the
           attachment's array names; each _LEN and _CW array holds the
           codebook_length Annex A prints; every length is 1 to 32 bits and
           every codeword fits in its length; and no codeword is a prefix of
           (or equal to) another. The Kraft sum of every codebook is printed;
           a codebook whose sum is below 1 is an incomplete code, which is
           listed again at the end but does not fail the run. Part 2's A.1.2
           takes the same checks against the AJCC arrays of its attachment,
           its tables numbered A.13 to A.24 without a gap, each printing
           codebook_length and cb_off and nothing else; and A.1.1 against the
           AJOC arrays, its tables numbered A.1 to A.12, the same way.
  Annex A  its tables run A.1, A.2, ... without a gap; A.14 and A.15 cover
           spectrum codebooks 1 to 11; a dimension-4 spectrum codebook prints
           cb_mod, cb_mod2, cb_mod3 and cb_off with cb_mod^4 ==
           codebook_length, cb_mod2 == cb_mod^2 and cb_mod3 == cb_mod^3, and a
           dimension-2 one prints cb_mod and cb_off only, with cb_mod^2 ==
           codebook_length; and cb_off agrees with A.15 - 0 for an unsigned
           codebook, (cb_mod - 1) / 2 for a signed one, whose values
           Pseudocode 19 then centres on zero.
  Noise    RANDOM_NOISE_TABLE holds 256 float literals, and the negation of
           every entry is also an entry, so the table's mean is exactly zero;
           its mean square is printed.
  QMF      QWIN holds 640 numbers, QWIN[0] is 0, and |QWIN[n]| equals
           |QWIN[640 - n]| for every other n (the signs are the table's own);
           ASPX_NOISE holds 512 pairs, whose mean energy clause 5.7.6.4.3 says
           is 1, and is printed.
  SSF      every Annex C table has the table_length the text prints; both CDF
           look-up tables run from 0 to 32 768 and never decrease; CDF_TABLE
           runs from 0 to 32 768 over 705 entries; STEP_SIZES_Q4_15 never
           increases and AC_COEFF_MAX_INDEX never decreases; each prediction
           coefficient matrix holds 33 (2 Rf + 1) Rt entries; and the layout of those
           matrices is the one in which each (nu, k) row is smooth in eta: the printed
           index formula (nu, k, eta) is not (see PRED_COEFF_LAYOUT).
  Annex B  Table B.1 lists the fifteen 44.1/48 kHz transform lengths, as
           Table 106 does; every row of Tables B.1 and B.4 to B.19 has
           exactly one reading (see read_row) with its sfb or max_sfb_master
           index in sequence; every 44.1/48 kHz offset column starts at 0,
           strictly increases through num_sfb + 1 entries and ends at its
           transform length; and each of Tables B.8 to B.19 has one row per
           max_sfb_master value n_side_bits can express, columns only for
           shorter lengths that Table B.1 lists, and values that never
           decrease down a column nor exceed that column's num_sfb.

In Annex B's text a number prints with a space as its thousands separator
("1 600"); columns are separated by runs of spaces, except that an index
column can sit one space from the value beside it ("37 576"); and a column
holds "-" below the last band of its transform length. read_row()
enumerates every way to read a row and requires exactly one of them to fit
the table's shape, so a row with two fitting readings stops the run.
