"""Conformance vector set generator (conformance vectors publication).

Builds the versioned bundle of AC-3 / E-AC-3 / Atmos streams this project
publishes as a release artifact, so another decoder implementer has something
concrete to test against. No free ATSC or ETSI conformance bitstreams exist
publicly; this is the project's answer to that, going the opposite direction
from every other check in the repo (which consumes other people's streams as
oracles rather than producing any).

What it emits, under --out:

    MANIFEST.json    every vector, what it exercises, its hashes, and whether
                     FFmpeg can read it
    README.md        how to use the set, written for someone who did not build
                     it
    source/          the PCM each vector was encoded from
    vectors/         the streams themselves, by codec

Everything published is this project's own output, encoded from source PCM
this project synthesized - nothing from testdata/external-baseline (Dolby
Media Encoder / FFmpeg output) is ever copied in. See README.md's "Licensing"
section, which this script writes.

Reproducibility: run it twice on one machine and every hash matches, which is
what --check-determinism asserts. Hashes do NOT carry across compilers or
architectures - docs/building.md records a measured cross-toolchain
difference, and the arm64 legs sit 6 dB off the x86 gold numbers
(cross-platform bitstream reproducibility) - so the manifest records the
exact toolchain that produced it and a consumer compares hashes only against
a bundle built the same way.

Usage (repo root, after a build):

    python tools/generators/gen_conformance_vectors.py \
        --cli build/config-linux-gcc/bin/forge \
        --out dist/conformance-vectors

    python tools/generators/gen_conformance_vectors.py --cli <path> \
        --out dist/conformance-vectors --archive

Signing: --sign asks for the Atmos signed-object vector, which needs a key
this project does not ship. Supply one through ICLFORGE_SIGNING_KEY /
ICLFORGE_SIGNING_KEY_FILE (the same environment forge itself reads) or
--signing-key <path>. Without a key the signed vector is omitted and the
manifest records why; nothing here ever invents or forges one.

# iclforge conformance vectors {manifest["version"]}

{len(manifest["vectors"])} AC-3 / E-AC-3 / Dolby Atmos streams ({by_codec}), each with the PCM it
was encoded from and a description of what it exercises. Produced by
[iclforge](https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge), a clean-room C++23 implementation.

No free ATSC or ETSI conformance bitstreams exist publicly. This set exists so another decoder
implementer has something concrete to test against.

## Layout

```
MANIFEST.json    every vector: what it exercises, its hashes, and whether FFmpeg can read it
source/          the PCM each vector was encoded from
vectors/ac3/     AC-3 (A/52 Annex A-D)
vectors/eac3/    E-AC-3 (A/52 Annex E)
vectors/atmos/   E-AC-3 carrying Dolby Atmos objects (OAMD + JOC, ETSI TS 103 420)
paths.txt        the authored object-motion keyframes one Atmos vector was built from
```

## Using it to test a decoder

**Decode the stream, measure against the source PCM.** `MANIFEST.json` gives each vector's
`source`. Decode the vector, align it against that WAV and measure SNR. This is the check that
means something across implementations.

**Do not compare PCM byte-for-byte.** `decoded_pcm_sha256` is this project's own decoder's
output on the toolchain named in `built_with`. Two correct decoders disagree in the last bits of
every float sample; the hash is here so a regenerated bundle can be checked against this one, not
so your decoder can be checked against ours.

**Do compare levels.** Each vector's `decoded_levels` gives per-channel peak and RMS in dBFS.
Those survive any correct decoder's own rounding, so a channel that is more than a fraction of a
dB out - or in the wrong slot - is a real finding. Channel names are A/52 Table 5.8 order for
AC-3 and Table E2.5 location order for E-AC-3.

**Read `exercises` before chasing a failure.** It names the syntax each vector is there for,
down to the clause: which Annex E tools are on, whether the stream carries dependent substreams,
whether it is a reduced-rate (`fscod2`) stream, whether object metadata rides in the EMDF
container.

## What FFmpeg can and cannot read

{ffmpeg_full} of these vectors decode under FFmpeg, {ffmpeg_header} are framed correctly by it
but refuse to decode, and {ffmpeg_none} it cannot read at all. Every vector's `ffmpeg` field says
which and why. The three states are not interchangeable: a stream FFmpeg has no syntax for is not
the same as one it rejects.

The gaps are FFmpeg's, not this encoder's - a second dependent substream (7.1.4), enhanced
coupling, transient pre-noise processing, and `fscod2` audio. Those four are exactly where an
independent implementation is most useful, because nothing else public reads them either.

## Reproducing this bundle

```
git clone https://github.com/iainchesworthlabs/iclforge && cd iclforge
git checkout {manifest["version"]}
cmake --preset config-linux-gcc && cmake --build --preset build-linux-gcc
python tools/generators/gen_conformance_vectors.py \\
    --cli build/config-linux-gcc/bin/forge --out dist/vectors
```

{manifest["hash_scope"]}

## Coverage

{manifest["coverage"]}

Every vector's source PCM is synthetic - sine tones plus seeded, band-limited noise. That is
enough to exercise every coding tool, and it is what makes the set redistributable, but it is
not real programme material: a defect that only shows on speech or music is not something this
set can find.
