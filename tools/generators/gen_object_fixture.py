"""Local-only generator for the committed third-party Dolby Atmos fixtures.

`testdata/object-fixture/dee_joc_514.ec3` is a DD+ JOC bitstream produced
by the Dolby Encoding Engine (bundled in "Dolby Media Encoder") from the
synthetic 5.1.4 tone bed this script also writes. With `dee_joc_714.ec3` and
`dee_joc_916.ec3` (below) these are the ONLY Atmos streams in this repository
that this project's own encoder did not make, and so the only check that the
object layer reads syntax nobody here writes:

  - a bed program (b_dyn_object_only_program 0) with a twelve-channel
    7.1.4 bed_channel_assignment and no dynamic objects at all;
  - b_bed_chan_distribute set;
  - object_gain_idx 3, "the previous object's gain", on eleven of the twelve;
  - two oa_elements, the second a trim_element with a custom global trim mode
    and a per-object disable list;
  - joc_dmx_config_idx 3 (5.X with a 90 degree phase shift), a nonzero
    joc_clipgain_x_bits (4, though joc_clipgain_y_bits is 0, so the computed
    joc_clipgain is exactly unity - see oba::joc::parse_payload's comment),
    joc_num_bands_idx 5, and sparse coding for every object;
  - and, in the EMDF container, an OAMD payload with payload_frame_aligned 0
    beside a JOC payload with it set, plus two further payloads whose
    configurations use duratione and discard_unknown_payload.

Every one of those was refused outright before the object layer learned to read them.

Why channel-based immersive and not an ADM master: DEE's `atmos_mezz` input
accepts BWF ADM, but its reader gates on content provenance ("Content was not
authored with Dolby tools") and refuses a master this project authors, so the
`cbi_wav` path is the only one available here. That is why the fixture has no
dynamic objects and therefore no object size, zone or snap on the wire - the
encode-side round trip in libs/ac3/tests/oba/test_oba.cpp covers those instead.

The 7.1.4 and 9.1.6 fixtures (`dee_joc_714.ec3`, `dee_joc_916.ec3`) exist for
the one thing the 5.1.4 one cannot say: whether the bed's channel ORDER holds
past ten channels, where the standard's Table 12 order and the order a
production tool takes its input in (L R C LFE Ls Rs Lrs Rrs [Lw Rw] heights...)
are two different permutations - 9.1.6 puts the wides at the END of the OAMD
bed but right after the rears at the input. A tone per channel, all at once,
reconstructs too close to its neighbours to be named from a 16-object parametric
downmix, so these beds play ONE channel at a time - channel k alone, for a tenth
of a second, in slice k - and a reconstructed object is then identified by which
slice it is loud in. That is unambiguous whatever the solver does with the rest,
and it names the channel without trusting this project's order for it.

DEE is licensed commercial software and must never run in CI, exactly as
gen_external_baseline.py says of the same binary - hence the same
GITHUB_ACTIONS guard. Run this locally, listen to or measure the result, and
commit the bitstream.
