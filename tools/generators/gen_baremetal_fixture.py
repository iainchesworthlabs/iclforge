"""Generate apps/baremetal/fixture.hpp - the bitstreams the minimum-footprint
decoder probe decodes, and the per-channel levels it checks them against
(minimum-footprint decoder profile).

The probe runs on a target with no filesystem, so its input has to be linked
in. Everything here is derived from committed inputs by committed tools:
tests/golden/audio/reference_51.wav (real programme material, per
CONTRIBUTING.md's own rule that silence and single tones make weak fixtures)
encoded by this project's own forge, then decoded by the same forge to
produce the expected levels. Re-running this script on an unchanged tree
reproduces the header byte for byte.

    python tools/generators/gen_baremetal_fixture.py --forge build/.../bin/forge

The streams are declared in one table (STREAMS below), each naming a layout
from another (LAYOUTS). Adding a configuration is a row in the first; adding a
channel layout is a row in the second. What each row is for:

  - AC-3 5.1 at 448 kbit/s: the widest classic layout, coupling on.
  - E-AC-3 5.1 at 384 kbit/s with tools=all: AHT, spectral extension and
    standard coupling stacked.
  - E-AC-3 5.1 at 384 kbit/s with tools=cpl+ecpl: §E3.5 enhanced coupling,
    which "all" does not select (parse_tools maps it to cpl+spx+aht) and which
    no other fixture here reaches. It is the branch behind ecpl_channel_spectrum,
    and behind the 512-point DFT that libs/dsp/src/fft.cpp is in the minimal
    source list for - both linked by every build of this profile and, until this
    stream existed, executed by none of them.
  - E-AC-3 Atmos at 448 kbit/s, six objects over a 5.1 bed, decoded BED ONLY
    (DecoderConfig::skip_object_reconstruction). The bed is ordinary E-AC-3 and
    fits; JOC's own reconstruction state does not, on any target this profile
    builds for - see docs/platforms/bare-metal/esp32-s3.md. The fixture is here to hold that
    distinction: an Atmos stream PLAYS on a part that cannot render its objects,
    and this is what says so on the target rather than on a host.
  - E-AC-3 2/0 at 192 kbit/s with tools=all: a non-5.1 layout, and with it
    §7.5.4 rematrixing, which is 2/0-only and so unreachable from any of the
    above however their tools are set.
  - E-AC-3 7.1.4 at 640 kbit/s with tools=all: a 5.1 bed and two dependent
    substreams (k71Rear, kTopQuad), the widest programme the encoder makes.
    The only fixture with more channels than one substream carries, so the
    access unit's assembly - locations unioned, a dependent's surrounds
    replacing the bed's - runs here alone; and twelve channels of output is
    what a part driving a 7.1.4 DAC has to find room and time for.
  - The two 5.1 streams decoded AGAIN through the §7.8 output stage - a Lo/Ro
    fold in line mode, the options the ESP32-S3 examples' CI comparison uses -
    as levels-only rows that reuse the bitstreams above. A player feeding a
    stereo DAC runs that fold every frame, and until these rows it ran
    nowhere the target measures.

The profile's library contains two decoders, and a probe that exercised only
one would leave the other unproven at link time as well as at run time - which
is why the AC-3 row is here at all.

Six frames each. Enough that frame 0's cold MDCT overlap is not the whole
sample (the same reason the C++ suite compares from frame 1 onward), small
enough that the generated header stays readable.

# forge's decode writes a WAV, and a WAV interleaves 5.1 as FL FR FC LFE BL BR
# (WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE) - not the order the DECODER hands its channels back
# in, which is AC-3's own Table 5.8 order L C R Ls Rs LFE. The probe reads the
# decoder's output directly, so the levels here have to be permuted into coded
# order or every channel but the first is compared against its neighbour's
# number.
#
# `wav_position[i]` is the WAV position holding coded channel i - the inverse of
# iclforge::ac3::plan::wav_order()'s own mapping for that layout. Written out per layout
# rather than derived, because deriving it means reimplementing wav_order() and
# kWavSpeakerOrder in Python and then keeping two statements of the same
# permutation agreeing. One row is checked here (it must be a permutation) and
# the whole row is checked on the target: a wrong entry makes the probe compare
# a channel against its neighbour's level, which for these fixtures differ by
# well over the 5% tolerance in probe.cpp's level_matches.
