"""Generate firmware/baremetal/ac4_fixture.hpp - the AC-4 bitstreams the bare-metal
AC-4 probe decodes, and the per-channel levels it checks them against
(planning/ac4.md, D14a).

The probe runs on a target with no filesystem, so its input is linked in. Every
stream is a committed one, read as it is, and the levels are what this project's
own decoder writes for it, so they are a regression reference (has this build
moved?) and not an independent oracle; the oracles are in tools/checks and
docs/verification.md. Re-running this script on an unchanged tree reproduces the
header byte for byte.

    python tools/generators/gen_baremetal_ac4_fixture.py --forge build/.../bin/forge

The streams are the table STREAMS below. What each is for:

  - ac4_20_music: a stereo stream DEE wrote, with A-SPX, at frame rate 23.438
    (frame_rate_index 13, the rate a part with a small heap decodes at).
  - ac4_20_acpl: a constructed stereo stream in A-CPL, the mode that adds
    decorrelators per band, so the row that shows what those cost.
  - ac4_51_music: 5.1 from DEE, the layout the P4 and the S3 are aimed at.
  - ac4_51_acpl: constructed 5.1 in A-CPL, with three decorrelators per band.
  - ac4_514_tones: DEE's widest layout in this set, ten channels (5.1.4), in
    full decoding: the row that measures what the widest programme needs of a
    part, on the way to the D14 rows.
  - ac4_20_companding: a stereo stream DEE wrote at 48 kbit/s, whose A-SPX
    runs the companding tool (b_compand_on in every frame): the one fixture
    that reaches float pow and exp2 in the decoder, so that its pinned hash
    is what holds decision 26 for the streams with companding (planning/ac4.md,
    D14a4).

The levels are the WAV that `forge decode` writes, read back per channel and put
in the order the decoder hands its channels over in (the speakers of
iclforge::ac4::DecodedFrame). For the three layouts here that is the file's own order (a
WAV's channel mask puts L R C LFE, the surround pair and the four heights in it),
and LAYOUTS says where each coded channel sits in the file, for a layout where it
is not.
