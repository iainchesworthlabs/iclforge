"""Build the stimulus set for a subjective listening test over the landscape legs.

Every quality number this project publishes is a waveform or model metric.
README.md and docs/verification.md have carried "no listening test has been
run" through nine releases, and ViSQOL's MOS-LQO - the closest thing here to
a perceptual score - is a *prediction* of what a panel would say, not a
panel. This script builds everything a real session needs; the listening
itself is human time, and docs/landscape.md#listening-test is the protocol
that spends it. tools/listening/score_listening_test.py turns the responses
back into the table there.

It measures the same three legs as the landscape comparison, read from
testdata/external-baseline/manifest.json so the two never drift apart:

  ac3-51-448       AC-3,   5.1,    448 kbit/s
  eac3-stereo-192  E-AC-3, stereo, 192 kbit/s
  eac3-51-256      E-AC-3, 5.1,    256 kbit/s

and, per leg, these conditions:

  reference    the source WAV itself, presented as the hidden reference
  iclforge     this build's encode (forge, run here)
  ffmpeg       the committed testdata/external-baseline/<leg>/ffmpeg.*
  dee          the committed .../dee.* - only where the manifest carries a
               real score for it. DEE's own two 5.1 legs are marked
               unverified there (that build drops the Ls channel; see
               gen_external_baseline.py's own header), so the 5.1 legs have
               no DEE arm and the results table says so rather than
               presenting a stimulus nobody should draw a conclusion from.
  anchor3500   BS.1534-3's mandatory low-pass anchor, 3.5 kHz
  anchor7000   BS.1534-3's optional low-pass anchor, 7 kHz

EVERY stimulus is decoded by FFmpeg, including this project's own encode.
That is deliberate and it is the opposite of what the trend legs do (which
score iclforge through forge's own decoder). A listening test compares
ENCODERS; if each encoder's output went through its own decoder, the panel
would be scoring encoder-and-decoder pairs and no result could be attributed
to either. One decoder for everything makes the decoder a constant. FFmpeg
is the one all three encoders have in common.

FFmpeg's decoder is not silent about what it reads, and this script records
that: any stimulus whose decode printed a decoder-level complaint is flagged
in the trials key with `decode_warnings`. This is not hypothetical - FFmpeg
reports two out-of-range exponents decoding DEE's own committed stereo
stream. A concealed error is a real artifact a listener will hear, but it is
an artifact of THAT decoder reading THAT stream, not of the encoder's
quality, and a results table that does not say so invites the wrong
conclusion.

Neither FFmpeg's nor DEE's ENCODER is ever invoked here - only forge's, and
FFmpeg's decoder. The external side comes from the committed bitstreams, the
same boundary docs/landscape.md documents for the numbers.

Two methods, because how many listeners are available decides which one is
worth running:

  mushra  BS.1534-3. Every condition for one leg presented together against
          a labelled reference, scored 0-100. Needs a panel; the statistics
          below are meaningless with one listener.
  abx     Forced-choice A/B/X, one (leg, condition) pair at a time. Works
          with a single listener and still supports a real significance
          claim - "this listener could tell them apart" - which is a
          narrower question than MUSHRA's but an answerable one.

Both write the same blind-labelled WAVs; only the trials key and the
response template differ.

Usage (repo root, after building forge):

    python tools/listening/gen_listening_stimuli.py --out listening-session
    python tools/listening/gen_listening_stimuli.py --out session-abx --method abx

Set ICLFORGE_CLI to override the forge binary, same as quality_race.py. Needs
numpy and an `ffmpeg` binary; the scoring script that reads the results back
needs neither.

# generous, but the case this guards against is not marginal - the committed
