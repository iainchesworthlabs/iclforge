# output, by running forge across the layout/codec/tool matrix this project
# already supports. Cheaper and more representative than hand-written corpus
# files: every seed here is a real, self-consistent stream this project can
# actually produce, so a fuzzer's mutations start from "almost valid" rather
# than from nothing.
#
# Needs a built forge. Any working configuration will do: this generates
# plain valid streams, not instrumented ones, so it needs neither Clang nor
# sanitizers. The Windows MSVC leg is what gets used in practice, for no
# better reason than that it is the one already built on the development
# host - every other leg builds clean too.
