# tools/fuzz/measure-agreement.sh - the calibration method behind
# differential_oracle.hpp's kMinAgreementDb (differential decoder fuzzing). Runs every file in
# libs/ac3/fuzz/seeds/fuzz_ac3_decode/ and libs/ac3/fuzz/seeds/fuzz_eac3_decode/ - real,
# already-shipping, unmutated content - through the differential harnesses
# once each with ICLFORGE_DIFF_MEASURE_ONLY=1 (measures and prints; never
# aborts, unlike a normal run) and reports the worst-channel SNR FFmpeg and
# this project's own decoder land on for each one.
#
# This is how kMinAgreementDb got its value, not a guess: the first version
# of this harness reused an existing 15 dB precedent from
# tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh, and this sweep found two seeds
# comfortably under it even though neither is remotely broken (see
# differential_oracle.hpp's own module comment for the bap-0-dither
# reasoning). Re-run this after adding new seed content - a new corner of
# legitimate decoder disagreement needs kMinAgreementDb reconsidered, not
# assumed - and after any change to compare_pcm's own alignment/silence-skip
# logic.
#
# Usage: tools/fuzz/measure-agreement.sh
# Needs the two differential harness binaries already built
# (tools/fuzz/run.sh regress fuzz_differential_ac3_decode fuzz_differential_eac3_decode
# builds them, even before ffmpeg is on PATH - it is only the differential
# comparison itself, not the build, that needs ffmpeg) and ffmpeg on PATH to
# measure anything at all.
