# Fuzzing

libFuzzer harnesses over every place ICL Forge parses externally-supplied
binary data. This is the codec's natural attack surface: its whole job is
decoding bitstreams whose structure it cannot control, and the project has
already had one bug in this class - commit `8386c8f` fixed a decoder
that shifted by an unvalidated exponent, walked outside the range the
reconstruction code assumed by a malformed differential chain, and hit
undefined behaviour on hostile input. It was found by a one-off manual
adversarial audit; this directory makes that kind of input-shape exploration
continuous and automatic instead.

## Why Clang only

libFuzzer (`-fsanitize=fuzzer`) is an LLVM built-in. GCC and MSVC do not ship
it, so everything here requires upstream Clang - specifically the
`linux-llvm` / `macos-llvm` toolchain this project already has presets for
(`windows-llvm` is clang-cl, whose libFuzzer support on Windows this project
has never exercised, so it is deliberately out of scope; see
`cmake/IclforgeFuzz.cmake`'s `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_FRONTEND_VARIANT` guard).

`.github/toolchain/03-llvm-toolchain.sh` installs `libclang-rt-<ver>-dev` (the
ASan/UBSan/libFuzzer runtime archives) and `llvm-<ver>` (`llvm-symbolizer`, which
turns a sanitizer report's addresses into file and line) with the Clang compiler
itself, for every Linux LLVM leg: the sanitizer legs need them too, so the script
does not fork the install. `fuzz.yml` needs no separate step for it; a local
Debian/Ubuntu run needs `apt-get install libclang-rt-22-dev` (or your distro's
equivalent) before `tools/fuzz/run.sh` will link.

## `-Werror` is on for this build too

This build once opted out of `iclforge::warnings`: `ICLFORGE_BUILD_FUZZERS` skipped
linking it into `iclforge`, on the stated assumption that the codebase carried
roughly sixteen sign-conversion and double-promotion sites that only the
Windows MSVC leg had ever been held to, and that clearing them belonged to the
cross-platform porting task rather than to fuzzing.

That number was never measured, and it was wrong. Building the harnesses with
`iclforge::warnings` linked in, under Clang 21 with the full set
(`-Werror -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Wdouble-promotion -Wold-style-cast`
and the rest) alongside ASan/UBSan/libFuzzer, produces **zero** warnings - the
other legs had gone green in the meantime and taken the debt with them. The
exemption was removed rather than re-justified, so `iclforge` now compiles
under one warning set in every configuration, this one included.

All harness executables link `iclforge::warnings` too, and had no warnings of
their own either. They need to name it explicitly: `iclforge` links it
`PRIVATE`, so the flags govern the library's own sources and do not propagate
to anything downstream of it.

That the set is live, and not merely listed on the command line, was
checked twice - once by injecting a deliberate sign-conversion and double-
promotion into a library source, once into a harness source - confirming the
fuzz build fails on both in each case.

## Status at the commit that added this

Like `ci.yml`'s own leg-status table, this is a point-in-time result, not a
standing guarantee - re-run it yourself rather than trusting an old number.

The section below is the original four harnesses' measurement; the signing-verify fuzz walk harnesses have their own, further down under "Status: the signing-verify fuzz walk harnesses",
along with what they found.

Two full bounded passes ran locally before this landed (Docker: `ubuntu:26.04`
+ LLVM 21, matching CI's `linux-llvm` leg, since this was developed on a
Windows host with no native libFuzzer). The first pass used a Debug build and
was clean but showed pathologically low throughput on the decode harnesses
(2-3 exec/s); switching to `RelWithDebInfo` - libFuzzer's own advice, build
with optimizations on even under sanitizers - fixed that. Numbers below are
the second pass, 180s/harness:

| Harness             | Executions | Corpus grown to  | Result |
|----------------------|-----------:|------------------|--------|
| `fuzz_scan`          |      ~25.9M | 116 files / 1.0MB | clean  |
| `fuzz_ac3_decode`    |       3,011 | 184 files / 5.8MB | clean  |
| `fuzz_eac3_decode`   |       2,796 | 166 files / 7.6MB | clean  |
| `fuzz_wav_read`      |      13,370 | 56 files / 14MB   | clean  |

No crash, hang, or sanitizer report across ~45M total executions between the
two passes; `fuzz/regressions/` was empty at that commit (it is not any
more - see "Status: the signing-verify fuzz walk harnesses"). `fuzz_scan`'s exec
count dwarfs the decode harnesses' because a format-sniff is orders of
magnitude cheaper than a real IMDCT-and-bit-allocation decode - expected, not
a sign anything is under-tested relative to its own cost.

## Status: the signing-verify fuzz walk harnesses

Same caveat as the section above - a point-in-time result, not a standing
guarantee. Measured on WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04, Clang 21, `RelWithDebInfo` +
ASan/UBSan, 300 s per harness from the committed seed corpus:

| Harness              | Executions | exec/s  | cov  | Result |
|-----------------------|-----------:|--------:|-----:|--------|
| `fuzz_emdf_parse`     |  4,982,134 |  16,551 |  120 | clean  |
| `fuzz_oamd_parse`     | 49,730,651 | 165,218 |  173 | clean  |
| `fuzz_joc_parse`      | 12,319,988 |  40,930 |   99 | clean  |
| `fuzz_signing_verify` |    ~70,000 |     n/a | 870+ | **three memory errors, one after the other** |
| `fuzz_adm_parse`      |     ~1,000 |     n/a |  n/a | **out-of-memory in the first minute, three times over** |

The two harnesses that found something stopped at the first report each time,
so their numbers are where they stopped, not a budget they survived. Both are
clean over a full budget once the findings below are fixed:

| Harness               | Executions | exec/s | cov  | Result |
|------------------------|-----------:|-------:|-----:|--------|
| `fuzz_signing_verify` |     91,865 |    218 | 1358 | clean, 420 s, fresh corpus |
| `fuzz_adm_parse`      |     47,732 |    158 |  116 | clean, 300 s |
| `fuzz_ac3_decode`     |     14,724 |     43 |  827 | clean, mutator on |
| `fuzz_eac3_decode`    |      3,583 |     12 | 1231 | clean, mutator on |

The two decode harnesses are in that table because the mutator gives them
reach they did not have before, and because the guards added for the findings
below sit in code they run: worth confirming they are still clean rather than
assuming it. Their exec rates are low here only because the machine was
heavily loaded at the time - compare the A/B section's figures below, measured
on the same harnesses under lighter load.

`fuzz_signing_verify`'s coverage went from 870 at the first report to 1358
once all three were fixed, which is the point: each defect was a wall the
mutation engine could not get past.

`fuzz_adm_parse` is the slowest harness here by a distance because
`parse_bw64` has no in-memory overload - libbw64's reader opens a file by
path - so every execution spools the input to a temporary file and reopens
it. `fuzz_oamd_parse`'s rate is three orders of magnitude above it, and two
above `fuzz_signing_verify`'s, for the equally plain reason that an OAMD
payload is tens of bytes and its parse is a bit walk, while a signing
verification reconstructs a whole frame's message A bit by bit and runs
HMAC-SHA-256 over it.

### What they found

Seven reports, at three sites, all fixed in the same change, each with a
committed reproducer under `fuzz/regressions/`.

**`compute_bit_allocation` walked off its own arrays** on regions whose
shape only a debug `assert` had ever constrained - so the shipped NDEBUG
build had nothing between a hostile frame and the memory error. Three
reports, each surfacing once the one before it was fixed:

- an EMPTY region indexed `kMaskTab` at `SIZE_MAX`. §7.2.2.4's band walk ends
  at `kMaskTab[end - 1]`, and `end - 1` on `end == 0` is `-1`. (UBSan.)
- a region LONGER than the 253-mantissa ceiling §7.2.2.2's `psd` array is
  sized to wrote one element past the end of it. (ASan
  `stack-buffer-overflow`: a 4-byte write at offset 1076 of a 1012-byte frame
  object.)
- `iclforge::ac3::signing`'s own per-channel tally took `subspan(0, endmant)` of the
  exponent array the walk had actually recovered, without checking that
  `endmant` fits in it. That is a precondition, not a clamp: on an empty
  span it manufactures one with a null data pointer and a non-zero size,
  which `compute_bit_allocation` then dereferenced. (UBSan, "reference
  binding to null pointer".)

The first two are guarded in the library, so the decoder is covered as well
as the signer, and `region.start` was folded into the same guard rather than
left for a fourth report. The third is guarded at the caller, because a
frame whose `endmant` disagrees with its own exponents has already lost bit
sync - `parse()`'s existing `desynced` flag is the right answer, and it
means such a frame is never signed or verified against a bit range that was
never right. The same shape as `8386c8f`, the bug this directory was created
for.

**`iclforge::adm::parse_bw64` allocated from declared chunk sizes.** Three reports,
two distinct causes:

- `read_pcm` sized its PCM buffer from the DECLARED `<data>` chunk size, so a
  104-byte file claiming ~4 GB of audio allocated ~4 GB
  (`malloc(8321498636)`). Bounded by the real file size now, which for a
  well-formed file never binds.
- any OTHER over-claiming chunk did the same thing one layer down: libbw64
  materialises every chunk it reads except `<data>` into a `std::vector`
  sized straight from the chunk header, inside `readFile()`, before any
  ICL Forge code runs. Reported twice, at two different chunk ids, one of them
  using RF64's `0xFFFFFFFF` escape value. `adm.cpp`'s `chunk_sizes_fit()`
  refuses it. The allocation itself is in third-party code, and the residual
  gap is stated in that function's own comment rather than papered over.

**`verify_atmos_frame` inherited the SIGNER's debug subset assertion**, so a
Debug build aborted on `forge decode <plain stereo>.ec3 out.wav
verify-objects` - an ordinary input for an operation whose whole job is
checking streams its caller did not produce. Found while writing the harness
rather than by it: these builds are NDEBUG, so the harness could not have
caught this one itself.

### What the mutator bought

`fuzz_ac3_decode` and `fuzz_eac3_decode`, 300 s each from an identical fresh
corpus and the same `-seed`, once with the custom mutator and once with it
compiled out. Both grown corpora were then replayed through the SAME binary
with `-runs=0`, so the coverage figures are comparable rather than each
being read off its own build:

| Harness            | Mutator | Executions | Corpus | `cov` | `ft` |
|---------------------|---------|-----------:|-------:|------:|-----:|
| `fuzz_eac3_decode` | off     |      3,366 |    271 |  1151 | 3851 |
| `fuzz_eac3_decode` | on      |      4,546 |    233 |  **1284** | **4147** |
| `fuzz_ac3_decode`  | off     |     12,739 |    283 |   713 | 2384 |
| `fuzz_ac3_decode`  | on      |     12,860 |    295 |  **787** | **2723** |

+11.6% and +10.4% edge coverage, +7.7% and +14.2% features, for the same
wall-clock budget. The E-AC-3 execution count went up as well (4,546 against
3,366), which is not the direction repairing the checksum would obviously
push it - a frame that clears the CRC costs a full decode where a rejected
one costs almost nothing. The two runs also grew differently-shaped corpora
(233 files / 14.5 MB against 271 / 17 MB), and average input size is what
sets per-exec cost here, so that is the likely reason rather than anything
about the repair itself. Recorded as observed; the coverage columns are the
result this change is claiming.
The mutator's re-stamping half also has its own portable unit test
(`libs/ac3/tests/core/test_crc_mutator.cpp`), so a crc1 solved wrongly would fail the
ordinary test suite on every platform rather than only showing up as a
coverage number that quietly stopped improving.

## Status: the IAB and AC-4 harnesses, instrumented

`fuzz_iab_parse` and `fuzz_ac4_parse` were added without their libraries in
`cmake/IclforgeFuzz.cmake`'s instrumented set: `iclforge_iab_objects` and `iclforge_ac4_objects`
compiled with no ASan, UBSan or coverage flags. The harness executable still
carried the sanitizer runtime, so a segfault, a timeout or an oversized
allocation stopped a run, but nothing the parser did within its own memory was
checked, and libFuzzer's counters saw only the harness file itself - 102 of
them in `fuzz_ac4_parse`, 183 in `fuzz_iab_parse`.

The opt-in `fuzz_adm_parse` had the same gap; it is covered in its own section
below, since closing it needed a change to a dependency first.

Measured on WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04, Clang 22.1.2, through `tools/fuzz/run.sh`, 300 s per
harness from an empty grown corpus, both builds running at once. "Before" is
`main` without the instrumentation; "after" is instrumented, with the fixes
below. The replay column feeds each grown corpus, plus the committed seeds and
regressions, through the same instrumented binary with `-runs=0`, so the two
rows of each pair are comparable:

| Harness          | Build  | Executions | exec/s | `cov` / `ft` (own build) | Replay `cov` / `ft` |
|------------------|--------|-----------:|-------:|--------------------------|---------------------|
| `fuzz_ac4_parse` | before |  6,980,996 | 23,192 | 62 / 315                 | 1,064 / 4,399       |
| `fuzz_ac4_parse` | after  |    377,064 |  1,252 | 1,270 / 6,424            | **1,270 / 6,423**   |
| `fuzz_iab_parse` | before |  7,279,906 | 24,185 | 101 / 488                | 564 / 2,665         |
| `fuzz_iab_parse` | after  |  4,130,921 | 13,723 | 711 / 3,425              | **711 / 3,424**     |

The instrumented AC-4 run made about an eighteenth of the executions and still
reached more of the parser. libFuzzer keeps an input only when it reaches
something new, and without counters in the parser, new paths inside it did not
count.

### What instrumenting them found

Each is fixed, with a test in `tests/ac4/` or `libs/iab/tests/` that fails on the
old code under ASan+UBSan:

- **Before any mutation**, replaying the committed AC-4 corpus: a
  stack-buffer-overflow. `n_objects_code` and both `isf_config` fields are 3
  bits wide and indexed six-entry count tables, so codes 6 and 7 read past
  them. The input was `libs/ac4/fuzz/regressions/fuzz_ac4_parse/ac4-substream-size-not-transmitted`,
  committed for an earlier fix; the uninstrumented runs read whatever followed
  the table and carried on.
- **After 8,606 executions**, a UBSan signed overflow:
  `presentation_config_ext_info()` computed its skip as `8 * n_skip_bytes` in
  `int`, with `n_skip_bytes` escaping through `variable_bits()` to 2^32
  (`libs/ac4/fuzz/regressions/fuzz_ac4_parse/ac4-presentation-config-ext-skip-overflow`).
- **After 1.67 million executions**, a timeout in `fuzz_iab_parse`:
  `parse_mxf_iab`'s KLV walk bounded a Value with `value_offset + length`, and a
  Length of `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE7` at offset 25 wrapped that sum to 0, so the
  walk returned to the start of the file forever
  (`libs/iab/fuzz/regressions/fuzz_iab_parse/mxf-klv-length-wraps-to-start`). This one
  hangs the uninstrumented build too; its runs never reached it.

Reading the AC-4 code around those fixes turned up the same shapes elsewhere,
fixed in the same change: `parse_raw_frame()`'s substream bound could wrap into
a read past the end of the frame, and six more `int` additions on counts that
escape through `variable_bits()` could overflow.

## Status: the AC-4 decoder and encoder harnesses

`fuzz_ac4_decode` and `fuzz_ac4_encode` are in `tools/fuzz/run.sh`'s default list, so
`fuzz-regress`, `fuzz-short` and `fuzz-nightly` run them with the others.
`cmake/IclforgeFuzz.cmake` instruments `iclforge_ac4_objects` for them, as it does for
`fuzz_ac4_parse`.
`fuzz_ac4_decode` starts from `fuzz_ac4_parse`'s seeds and keeps regressions of
its own, four so far:

- `asf-ext-code-past-21-bits`: the first run stopped 2,690 executions in. The
  escape of `ext_code` counts leading ones that Part 1's Pseudocode 20 does not
  bound, and a long run of them shifted a 32-bit value by 32. Table 40 limits the
  escape to 21 bits, which the decoder now enforces (`libs/ac4/ERRATA.md`,
  "ext_code is at most 21 bits").
- `ajoc-upmix-signals-runaway-count`: `n_fullband_upmix_signals` escapes through
  `variable_bits(3)`, and a 391-byte frame sent 1,227,133,139. The decoder listed
  that many objects before it checked how many a substream may describe, and the
  harness stopped on `malloc(3221225472)`. The list now ends one past the 64
  objects an OAMD portion holds.
- `toc-repeated-group-refs` and `toc-index-overflow`, both found by a review and
  committed with their fixes: a presentation that names one substream group
  thousands of times, which the decoder walked once for each reference (a
  25 KB frame reached about 1.2e9 iterations), and a `substream_index` whose
  `variable_bits()` escape reached `INT_MAX`, so that the next instance of a
  frame-rate-multiplied series overflowed an `int`.

`fuzz_ac4_encode` has no regression inputs: a violation aborts, and libFuzzer
keeps the input.

The corpus `tools/fuzz/run.sh` grows for `fuzz_ac4_decode` also feeds
`tools/checks/ac4_syntax_differential.py` (`--inputs <directory>`), which reads
every frame of each file through both syntax transcriptions, the decoder's and
`tools/references/ac4_syntax.py`, and compares their traces. Without `--inputs`
the script compares them on mutated DEE frames and on synthetic tables of
contents; the nightly SonarCloud workflow runs it so, and it does not gate a
merge.

## Status: the ADM harness, instrumented

`fuzz_adm_parse` was the last harness whose library sat outside the instrumented
set, and the only one that needed a change to a dependency before it could join.
libbw64 is header-only, so instrumenting `iclforge_adm_objects` instruments the libbw64
code it compiles, and UBSan stopped the harness a few hundred executions in,
inside `UnknownChunk`'s constructor.

### First pass: instrumented against the pinned `0.10.0`

Same caveat as the sections above — a point-in-time result, not a standing
guarantee. Measured on WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04, Clang 22.1.2, `RelWithDebInfo` +
ASan/UBSan, 300 s per build from an empty grown corpus. "Before" is
`iclforge_adm_objects` uninstrumented, as it shipped; "after" is instrumented, with a
patch for the constructor above and the fixes below applied. The replay column
feeds each grown corpus, plus the committed seeds and regressions, through the
same instrumented binary with `-runs=0`:

| Build    | Executions | exec/s | `cov` / `ft` (own build) | Replay `cov` / `ft` |
|----------|-----------:|-------:|--------------------------|---------------------|
| before   |     76,299 |    253 | 114 / 166                | 1,425 / 1,655       |
| after    |    147,230 |    489 | 1,656 / 3,143            | **1,654 / 3,124**   |

The committed seeds and regressions replay at 1,379 / 1,573 on their own, so that
is the floor each grown corpus is adding to.

The uninstrumented build's `cov` counts the harness translation unit alone: with
no counters inside `iclforge::adm` or libbw64, an input reaching a new path in the reader
did not register as new, and was not kept. Its execution rate was the higher one
until the findings below were fixed — several of them cost whole seconds per
execution, and the instrumented run reached 489 exec/s once they were gone.

**What it found.** Two in libbw64, patched at the time; the rest in `iclforge::adm`'s
own code. Each has a reproducer under `libs/adm/fuzz/regressions/fuzz_adm_parse/`:

- **`&buffer[0]` of an empty `std::vector<char>`**, in libbw64's `UnknownChunk`
  constructor (any zero-length chunk of an id it has no class for) and in
  `Bw64Reader::read()` (a zero-length `<data>`). Undefined behaviour, which UBSan
  reports and a standard library with its bounds checks enabled aborts over.
  (`zero-length-unknown-chunk`, `zero-length-data-chunk`, and `libs/adm/tests/`.)
- **A heap overread the length of a whole frame**, from a `<fmt >` whose channel
  count and sample width overflow libbw64's `uint16_t` block alignment: the read
  buffer is sized from the wrapped value and decoded against the real one. WAVE's
  own `nBlockAlign` field is 16 bits too, so the file's declared value matches the
  wrapped one and libbw64's sanity check passes. The 32,768-channel form divides
  by the wrapped 0 instead. An uninstrumented `iclforge::adm` runs the overread as a
  clean execution and returns it as audio. (`block-align-wraps-to-zero`.)
- **A 1.7 GB allocation**, from an RF64 `<data>` declaring more bytes than the
  file holds: `chunk_sizes_fit()` allows that, since a truncated recording is an
  ordinary file, but stopped checking there — while libbw64 resolves `<data>`'s
  real size through `<ds64>` and carries on into the chunks behind it.
  (`oversized-chunk-after-escaped-data`.)
- **A loop of 4.26 billion reads**, from a 28-byte `<ds64>` declaring that many
  12-byte table entries. (`ds64-table-length-past-chunk-end`.)
- **`malloc(4278190080)` out of a 19-byte file**, whose chunk table ends in a
  fragment too short to hold a header: libbw64 reads one anyway, and its size
  field keeps whatever was on the stack. (`truncated-chunk-header-fragment`.)
- **A hang in this project's own code**, 265 s into the first full-budget run,
  and at the time the only finding not in libbw64: this module used to detect a
  float master by walking the chunk table itself, ahead of libbw64
  (`float_pcm_bw64.cpp`, since retired - see below), and that walk's own
  `find_chunk()` stepped over each chunk in 32-bit arithmetic. A size of
  `0xFFFFFFF7` carries `8 + declared + pad` to exactly 2^32, which wraps to
  zero, and every file went through that walk. (`chunk-size-wraps-the-walk`.)

One gap was left open at this point: `<ds64>`'s table can give any chunk id a
64-bit size, which libbw64 prefers over the 32-bit header and which
`chunk_sizes_fit()`'s pre-check reads only the length of, not the entries.
Crafted inputs reached a hang and a 1 TiB allocation through it; mutation had
not. See the next section for how that was closed.

### Re-pinned to a maintained fork

`libs/adm/CMakeLists.txt` now fetches libbw64 from a maintained fork,
`github.com/pwnified/libbw64`, rather than the EBU's own repository - see that
file's own header comment for why, and `docs/library/adm.md`/`docs/threat-model.md`
for what changed. Two consequences for this harness:

- The fork carries the EBU's own upstream hardening forward (77 commits past the
  `0.10.0` tag this module used to pin, none of them ever tagged in a release),
  which **closes the gap left open above**: its chunk-header scan resolves every
  chunk's size through the `<ds64>` table, not only `<data>`'s, and refuses
  anything that then runs past the real end of the file - confirmed empirically
  by replaying both crafted inputs from that gap (now clean) and by
  `libs/adm/tests/test_adm.cpp`'s own dedicated case for it.
- The fork also added native `WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT` support, which this module
  did not have a use for before: `float_pcm_bw64.cpp`/`.hpp`, the hand-rolled
  container walk that used to exist purely to read float samples libbw64
  refused to open, is retired. Both integer PCM and float now go through the
  same libbw64 read - see `docs/library/adm.md`'s "PCM formats" section.

Two things the fork does not do differently from the EBU's own upstream, both
caught by this project's own tests rather than by fuzzing - neither is a
memory-safety finding, just a capability gap against what this module's own
docs claimed:

- Its chunk-header scan has no exception for `<data>` running past the file,
  so a recording truncated mid-capture - which `libs/adm/tests/test_adm.cpp`
  requires to still parse, and which every prior version of libbw64 allowed -
  is refused outright.
- `FormatInfoChunk`'s constructor (`chunks.hpp`) accepts `bitsPerSample` 16, 24
  or 32 only, regardless of format - so a 64-bit `WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT`
  `<fmt >` is refused at open time even though the fork's own
  `decodeFloatSamples`/`encodeFloatSamples` (`utils.hpp`) both handle 64-bit
  float correctly; they are simply never reached. `model.hpp`'s own `PcmAudio`
  comment had claimed 32/64-bit float both read since before this module was
  first vendored, and no test had ever exercised the 64-bit half of that claim
  until this pass added one - which is what surfaced this.

`libs/adm/patch_libbw64.cmake` carves out both; see its own comment for the
reasoning and for the upstream PRs proposing the same fixes, which would let
each half of this patch be deleted once it lands.

Re-measured the same way as the first pass, with this instrumented build now
the sole build (there is no meaningful "before" any more - `iclforge_adm_objects` has
been instrumented since the first pass, and the library underneath it changed,
not the instrumentation):

| Executions | exec/s | `cov` / `ft` (own build) | Replay `cov` / `ft` |
|-----------:|-------:|--------------------------|----------------------|
|    575,498 |  1,911 | 1,754 / 3,529            | **1,752 / 3,528**    |

Clean over the full budget: no crash, hang or sanitizer report. Every input
from the first pass - the six findings above, the residual-gap probes, and the
committed seed/regression corpus - replays clean through this build too. Both
exec/s and coverage moved up again from the first pass's already-improved
"after" row (489 exec/s, cov 1,656) - the fork's own `<cue >`/`labl` marker
chunks (added on top of the EBU's upstream, not part of this module's own
model) are new code the seed corpus never reached before and mutation now
does, and nothing left in the reader costs whole seconds per execution the
way the fixed findings used to.

## Entry points covered

| Harness              | Calls                                                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fuzz_scan`            | `iclforge::ac3::io::scan` - format-sniffing before any decoder commits to a layout |
| `fuzz_matroska_demux`  | `iclforge::containers::matroska::demux` + `iclforge::containers::matroska::Reader` - the EBML walk over a container from a disc rip, a broadcast capture or a download, every length in it self-declared. Both entry points run on the same bytes, the reader in chunks whose size the input's first byte sets |
| `fuzz_mp4_demux`       | `iclforge::containers::mp4::demux` + `iclforge::containers::mp4::Reader` - the box walk, and the sample table it resolves against the file: an index of self-declared offsets and sizes. Both entry points run on the same bytes, the reader in chunks whose size the input's first byte sets |
| `fuzz_mpegts_demux`    | `iclforge::containers::mpegts::demux` + `iclforge::containers::mpegts::Reader` - sync search, PSI section reassembly and PES reassembly, every loop driven by a self-declared length, over a format that is expected to arrive damaged. Both entry points run on the same bytes, the reader in chunks whose size the input's first byte sets |
| `fuzz_ac3_decode`      | `iclforge::ac3::split_frames` + `iclforge::ac3::FrameDecoder::decode_frame`, one decoder across all frames, the way `forge decode` drives it |
| `fuzz_eac3_decode`     | `iclforge::ac3::split_access_units` + `iclforge::ac3::Eac3Decoder::decode_access_unit` (which calls `decode_substream` internally), the way `forge decode` drives it for E-AC-3 |
| `fuzz_differential_ac3_decode`, `fuzz_differential_eac3_decode` | The same paths as the two rows above; the same bytes are then decoded by FFmpeg and the PCM compared. Not in the default list; see "Differential mode" below |
| `fuzz_wav_read`        | `iclforge::ac3::io::read_wav` - a realistic input too (a truncated or hand-edited WAV), not only an adversarial one |
| `fuzz_iec61937_unwrap` | `iclforge::containers::iec61937::BurstReader` + `unwrap_stream` - IEC 61937 burst de-framing, driven the way `forge unspdif` drives it. The input is by definition off a wire (an S/PDIF or HDMI capture), and `Pd` states a length the parser must not believe past its data type's repetition period. Pushed as two chunks split at a mutation-chosen point, so the state machine's carry-across-a-chunk-boundary paths are reachable. The input also goes to `Ac4BurstPacker` as an AC-4 sync frame (IEC 61937-14), whose burst must be its period long and read back as the frame |
| `fuzz_iab_parse`       | `iclforge::iab::parse_iabitstream`, `parse_mxf_iab` and `parse_iaframe` on one input - the IAB bitstream's Preamble+IAFrame run (§7), the KLV wrapper of an IAB track file in MXF, and one extracted frame (§9.1). Built with `ICLFORGE_BUILD_IAB` |
| `fuzz_iamf_parse`      | `iclforge::containers::iamf::read_sequence` and `read_isobmff` on one input - IAMF's standalone OBU stream and its ISO-BMFF encapsulation (files and movie fragments) - then `write_sequence`, `write_isobmff` and `decode_pcm` on whatever they return. Built with `ICLFORGE_BUILD_IAMF` |
| `fuzz_ac4_parse`       | `iclforge::ac4::scan`, `iclforge::ac4::SyncFrameSplitter` and `iclforge::ac4::parse_raw_frame` - sync search and the table of contents, on each sync frame `scan` finds and on the whole input as one raw frame, so a mutated table of contents is reached without a well-formed sync frame having to be guessed first; then `iclforge::ac4::build_dac4` and its refusals, the CMAF rules, the codec string and the manifest functions (`signalled_presentation` and the rest, Part 2 Annex G, and Annex H.1.2.4's `configuration_difference`) on every table of contents that reads. Built with `ICLFORGE_BUILD_AC4` |
| `fuzz_ac4_decode`      | `iclforge::ac4::Decoder::parse` and `decode` - every substream below the table of contents (section lengths, Huffman codewords, A-SPX envelope counts, DRC gain sets, EMDF payloads) and the reconstruction to PCM, A-SPX, A-CPL, the immersive element, A-JOC, the object audio metadata and the intermediate spatial format among it. The input's last three bytes choose the output processing, the concealment policy, the presentation, core decoding and the renderer's layout, and half way through a stream the settings change as a player's do. Its seeds are `fuzz_ac4_parse`'s |
| `fuzz_ac4_encode`      | `iclforge::ac4::Encoder` over the configuration the input's first bytes choose (layouts from mono to 7.1 and the immersive ones, rates, codec modes, I-frames, frame rates, metadata, DRC, downmix, dialogue enhancement, substreams and presentations) and the samples after them as 32-bit floats, NaN and values far past full scale included. Every frame must read back through the decoder's syntax layer with the encoder's own trace, decode to finite PCM, and come out the same from a second encoder. It draws no objects; `tools/ci/fuzz_ac4_encoder_space.py` does |
| `fuzz_emdf_parse`      | `iclforge::objects::emdf::parse_container` - ETSI TS 102 366 Annex H's container, located by a bit-by-bit sync scan and sized by its own 16-bit length field |
| `fuzz_oamd_parse`      | `iclforge::objects::oba::parse_payload` - TS 103 420 §5's `object_audio_metadata_payload`, as recovered from an EMDF payload with id 11 |
| `fuzz_joc_parse`       | `iclforge::ac3::oba::joc::parse_payload` - TS 103 420 §6's `joc()` payload: Huffman-coded coefficients into a matrix sized from the stream's own numbers |
| `fuzz_signing_verify`  | `iclforge::ac3::signing::verify_atmos_stream` + `verify_atmos_frame` - operator-supplied stream, operator-supplied key, no CRC check in front of either |
| `fuzz_osc_parse`       | `iclforge::objects::oba::parse_osc_packet` - the OSC 1.0 wire form of a live object-position update (live OSC object positions), reached straight from a UDP datagram by `iclforge::audio::LivePositionSource` whenever `positions=osc:<port>` is in play. No CRC, no container, no bitstream ahead of it at all - this project's first NETWORK-facing input rather than a file or capture-device one; see `docs/threat-model.md` |
| `fuzz_adm_parse`       | `iclforge::adm::parse_bw64(std::istream&)` - BW64/RF64 chunks plus an arbitrary ADM XML document. Opt-in, see below |
| `fuzz_sendspin_json`   | `iclforge::sendspin::json::Document::parse` - the JSON of every Sendspin message, the first code a network peer's bytes reach on hearth's server and on a sink. Every accessor runs on every value parsed, and the document is written back out and parsed again, which must give the same text |
| `fuzz_sendspin_handshake` | `iclforge::sendspin::handshake`'s parsers - `client/init` (read by a server from a client nothing has authenticated), `server/init`, `server/error`, `noise/handshake`, and the payloads of the two Noise messages. Whatever parses is written back out and must parse to the same value |
| `fuzz_sendspin_messages` | `iclforge::sendspin::messages`' and `iclforge::sendspin::pairing_messages`' readers - the core messages after the handshake, from `client/hello` to `group/update`, with the `_iclforge_player@v1` objects four of them carry, and the pairing messages, each read in the specification's dialect and aiosendspin 9.1.1's. Whatever reads is written back out, and that text must read and write back to itself |
| `fuzz_sendspin_frames` | `iclforge::sendspin::Reassembler`, `parse_player_chunk` and `parse_burst_chunk` - transport-mode fragment reassembly in the specification's form and aiosendspin 9.1.1's, and the `player@v1` chunk parser, in both forms of its header, and the `_iclforge_player@v1` one. The input is a control byte and length-prefixed frames; for one input in eight, chosen by three control bits, the input is also repeated past two frames, split in both fragment forms, and checked to reassemble |

### The object and metadata layer (signing-verify fuzz walk)

`fuzz_emdf_parse`, `fuzz_oamd_parse` and `fuzz_joc_parse` are the parsers behind a
skip field in every Atmos frame, where the object metadata lives, and they are
the deepest attacker-controlled bytes in the tree. Before them the layer was
reached only indirectly, through `fuzz_eac3_decode`, which meant it was reached
only by mutations that still had a valid CRC. That is the same blindspot the CRC mutator below exists for,
and the two changes landed together: direct harnesses so a mutation lands
inside the payload, and a mutator so the indirect path stops throwing its
inputs away at the checksum.

They are separate harnesses rather than one chained one because seeding
matters more here than reach. `tools/fuzz/metadata-seeds.py extract` pulls the real
containers and the real OAMD/JOC payloads out of the Atmos streams
`generate-seeds.sh` has just encoded, so each harness starts from bytes its
own parser accepts; reaching the same states through a container would spend
most of the budget on container syntax instead. Nothing in `forge` dumps a
raw payload, and the container is not byte-aligned inside the frame carrying
it (`put_skip_field` writes it 8 bits at a time from wherever the audio
happened to end), so the extractor locates it with the same bit-by-bit sync
scan `parse_container` itself does and repacks from that offset.

`fuzz_signing_verify`'s input is not a bare stream: it is a length byte, that
many key bytes, then the stream. The key is fuzzed because it is untrusted
too - a key file is operator-supplied and may be any length, including empty,
and `verify_atmos_stream` (unlike `sign_atmos_stream`) has no `key.empty()`
early-out - and because keying the HMAC differently is what makes `kValid`
and `kMismatch` both reachable. Nothing here derives, forges or reconstructs
a key; an arbitrary key produces an arbitrary tag, which is all verification
needs to be exercised. Signing is deliberately not fuzzed: it writes into the
caller's own buffer, and a caller signs a stream it just encoded.

### The ADM harness is opt-in

`fuzz_adm_parse` is the one harness here not built by default, and not in
`tools/fuzz/run.sh`'s default target list. `iclforge::adm` is the one library in this
build with a third-party dependency footprint beyond {fmt}: `ICLFORGE_BUILD_ADM`
is OFF by default, and turning it on additionally needs vcpkg's `adm` feature
for libadm's Boost headers plus network access for the `FetchContent` pulls of
libbw64 and libadm themselves - none of which anything else in this build
touches. `ICLFORGE_FUZZ_ADM=1 VCPKG_ROOT=... tools/fuzz/run.sh` turns all of that
on and appends the harness to the default list.

It is also the one harness whose reports may not land in ICL Forge's own code:
BW64 chunk-walking is libbw64's and ADM XML is libadm's. That is worth
knowing either way - the bytes reach them through an `iclforge::adm::` API this
project ships - but it changes what "fix it" means for a finding here.

`iclforge::ac3::io::read_wav` takes a path rather than a byte span, so
`fuzz_wav_read` round-trips libFuzzer's buffer through a scratch file
(`/dev/shm` when available) before calling it - the one unavoidable step
beyond calling the function directly, since there is no in-memory
overload to call instead.

## The CRC-repairing mutator (signing-verify fuzz walk)

"Differential mode" below records the problem in passing: "the overwhelming
majority of mutations get rejected immediately by this project's own decoder
(bad sync word, bad CRC, a reserved field)". Of those three, bad CRC is the
one that is pure loss. A bad sync word or a reserved value at least exercises
the rejection path it names. A bad CRC rejects an input whose ONLY defect is
the checksum, throwing away whatever the mutation did to the fields behind
it - and `decode_frame` checks crc1 and crc2 before reading one bit of bsi,
`decode_substream` checks crc2 before reading one bit of the audio blocks. So
every mutation that lands in a skip field, which is where the EMDF container
and therefore all of the object metadata lives, died two orders of magnitude
before the parser it was aimed at.

`fuzz_ac3_decode` and `fuzz_eac3_decode` now define an
`LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator` (`libs/ac3/fuzz/crc_mutator.hpp`): run libFuzzer's own
mutation first, then walk the result as a concatenation of syncframes -
same bsid-at-bit-40 test and same two size derivations `iclforge::ac3::split_frames`
uses - and rewrite each frame's CRC words in place.

Re-stamping is not a naive recompute. crc2 is an ordinary trailing CRC, but
crc1 **precedes** the region it protects: A/52 §7.10.1 requires the register
to read zero after the first 5/8 of the syncframe has been shifted through,
and says outright that crc1 is not the CRC of that region. It has to be
solved for, through the GF(2) polynomial inverse `iclforge::ac3::solve_leading_crc`
implements - the same call `libs/ac3/src/encoder/encoder.cpp` makes, down to
its crc2 == `kSyncWord` avoidance step (a crc2 that happens to equal 0x0B77
would make the frame's own tail look like the start of the next syncframe, so
the encoder flips crcrsv and recomputes; a mutator skipping that would hand
the splitter a frame boundary that is not there).

Two deliberate limits:

- **Nothing else is repaired.** Frame lengths, reserved fields and the
  bsi/audblk syntax are left exactly as the mutation left them. The goal is
  to stop losing inputs at the checksum, not to constrain the engine to valid
  streams.
- **One mutation in four is left unrepaired**, keyed off libFuzzer's own
  `Seed` argument. Always repairing would make a bad CRC unreachable by
  mutation, and the decoders' behaviour on a frame whose checksum is the only
  thing wrong with it is exactly what a re-stamping mutator would stop anyone
  from ever checking again.

The differential harnesses do not define one. They share their crash-only
siblings' seed corpora, so they inherit the deeper inputs this finds, but
adding the mutator there would multiply the number of inputs both decoders
accept - and every one of those spawns a real FFmpeg process.

## Differential mode (differential decoder fuzzing)

`fuzz_differential_ac3_decode` and `fuzz_differential_eac3_decode` drive the
exact same decode paths as `fuzz_ac3_decode`/`fuzz_eac3_decode` above, but
instead of (in addition to - a crash is still a crash) only checking for a
crash or sanitizer trip, they decode the SAME mutated bytes a second time
with FFmpeg and diff the resulting PCM against this project's own decode.
`libs/ac3/fuzz/differential_oracle.hpp` has the full mechanism and reasoning; the
short version:

- Both decoders have to accept the ENTIRE input - every frame/access unit,
  one unchanging acmod/sample rate throughout - before FFmpeg is even
  invoked. The overwhelming majority of mutations get rejected immediately
  by this project's own decoder (bad sync word, bad CRC, a reserved field),
  and none of those are worth a real FFmpeg process.
- A **PCM mismatch is only reported as a divergence when both decoders
  accepted the input and produced comparably-shaped audio.** FFmpeg's own
  error-concealment on a mutated (i.e. potentially malformed) frame can
  legitimately differ from this project's spec-strict decode - that proves
  nothing about which one is right, so it is treated as "no oracle for this
  one," the same stance `tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh` already takes for the
  Annex E tool combinations FFmpeg has no reading of at all (enhanced
  coupling, transient pre-noise processing, a second dependent substream/
  7.1.4 - see `docs/verification.md`'s "Where the oracles don't reach").
- Where a comparison IS eligible, the floor - `kMinAgreementDb = 6.0` in
  `libs/ac3/fuzz/differential_oracle.hpp` - is deliberately loose relative to what a
  clean, non-fuzzed stream actually measures at (`docs/verification.md`:
  float32-precision parity for the plain path, 98+ dB for coupling/spectral
  extension, 62-89 dB for AHT). It started from
  `tools/checks/verify_gold_reference.sh`'s own `CPLBNDSTRCE0_MIN_SNR_DB=15`
  precedent - this project's one existing floor for "two decodes of a
  bitstream neither side controls" - and was then calibrated down to 6 dB
  after `tools/fuzz/measure-agreement.sh` found committed seeds that legitimately
  measure below 15 dB (real, unmutated content whose bap-0 reconstruction
  FFmpeg dithers and this decoder zeros).
- `tools/fuzz/measure-agreement.sh` is the calibration method behind that floor:
  it runs every committed seed through the differential harnesses in
  measure-only mode and reports the worst-channel SNR each one lands on.
  Re-run it after adding seed content, and after any change to
  `compare_pcm`'s own alignment/silence-skip logic - a new corner of
  legitimate decoder disagreement needs the floor reconsidered, not
  assumed.

Because every comparable input spawns an FFmpeg process, these two
harnesses are much slower per-exec than every other harness here and are
NOT in `tools/fuzz/run.sh`'s default target list, so the `fuzz-regress` and
`fuzz-short` CI jobs do not run them. `fuzz-differential` runs them on every
push, and `fuzz-nightly` runs them again in steps of its own at its deeper
budget (see the CI section below). They need `ffmpeg` on PATH to
compare anything at all (silently a no-op otherwise, same as running without
`ffmpeg` installed locally). They share their crash-only siblings' seed
corpora rather than duplicating those files (`tools/fuzz/run.sh`'s
`seed_source_for`) - same bytes, same decode path, just with an extra
comparison bolted on.

## The other direction: the encoder's input space

Everything above mutates an already-encoded bitstream. That answers "does the
DECODER survive corrupt input", and it is the whole of what this directory
covered for a long time. The mirror-image question - "does the ENCODER, driven
across its own legal configuration space by adversarial but perfectly valid
audio, ever emit a stream a decoder refuses" - is
**`tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py`**, and nothing here asks it.

It is not a libFuzzer target and not part of `tools/fuzz/run.sh`: it drives the real
`forge`, so it needs the ordinary CLI build rather than this directory's
sanitizer/libFuzzer toolchain, and its failure signal is a decoder refusing a
stream rather than a sanitizer report. Per case it draws a random legal
encoder configuration (layout, bitrate, coupling, DRC, heavy compression,
dialnorm, downmix levels, forward-MDCT path), draws adversarial PCM built per
256-sample BLOCK so a frame's character can change part-way through it,
encodes, and then decodes the result with BOTH `forge decode` and FFmpeg's
strict decode - the same invocation `tools/ci/run_codec_matrix.sh` uses. A
refusal from either fails the case, with one arbitrated exception: when only
FFmpeg's default invocation refuses and the same bytes decode cleanly under
`-f ac3` with every error check kept, libavformat's container *guess* failed
rather than the stream, and the case counts as "misprobed" instead - measured
and explained in the script's note above `MIN_STREAM_BYTES` (large syncframes
can lose FFmpeg's probe-window race to the MPEG-PS prober no matter how long
the stream is).

Why it exists: PR #186 fixed an encoder defect (`deltbaie == 0` means "retain
the previous block's delta bit allocation", not "no delta") that produced
streams both decoders reject, and it escaped ctest, the codec matrix, the
gold-reference gate and every job in this file. Reaching it needs dense
harmonic content followed by digital silence inside one frame - an input
SHAPE, not an option combination, which is why enumerating options more
thoroughly would never have found it. The harness finds it in seconds; that
was verified by reverting the fix and running it (see the file's own header).

```bash
ICLFORGE_CLI=build/config-linux-llvm/bin/forge python3 tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py --seconds 120
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py --check-envelope      # re-measure the rate floors it draws from
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py --replay <case-seed>  # rerun one exact failing case
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_encoder_space.py --regressions         # replay every recorded past failure
```

Every case is a pure function of one 64-bit case seed, printed beside any
failure, so a random run stays fully reproducible after the fact. Failing
inputs are kept under `fuzz-encoder-artifacts/` (gitignored, and regenerable
from the seed).

Scope of this script: AC-3 `encode` only. The E-AC-3 and AC-4 encoders have the two scripts
described next.

### The E-AC-3 half

E-AC-3's own configuration space is **`tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py`**
(E-AC-3 encoder fuzzing), which the file above used to name as its own remaining gap. It
asks the same question of `eac3-encode` and `atmos-encode`, over the part of
the space that is E-AC-3's alone: Annex E tool tokens with their band-edge
pins (`cpl`, `ecpl`, `spx`, `aht`, `tpn`, `auto`), the `fscod2` half sample
rates, CBR and VBR, every layout including the ones that need dependent
substreams, and Atmos object counts. It imports the AC-3 harness's PCM
generator rather than copying it, so `cliff` and the rest of the adversarial
material are one implementation serving both.

Two things about it are different, and both come from E-AC-3 rather
than from a preference:

**The oracle is not one oracle.** FFmpeg reads AC-3 whole; it does not read
E-AC-3 whole, and what it cannot read is exactly what this covers. It refuses
a second dependent substream (`substreamid != 0`, which 7.1.4 needs), has no
model at all of enhanced coupling or transient pre-noise processing, and
refuses `fscod2` audio outright - as does Dolby's own Reference Player. So
every case is classified before it runs, and each class is checked as hard as
something external still can:

| class | what runs |
|---|---|
| `full` | FFmpeg strict decode, `run_codec_matrix.sh`'s exact invocation, plus both framing checks below |
| `header` | no FFmpeg decode, but the framing is still checked - twice |
| `none` | nothing at all - empty, kept so a future cell that escapes even the independent walk is reported rather than silently passed |

The `header` class is the "no oracle" cell class, and it is deliberately not
an empty gesture, because framing can be checked without decoding anything.
Two things do it:

- **`syncframe_walk()`**, the harness's own walk over the four fields that
  decide E-AC-3's framing - syncword, `strmtyp`, `substreamid`, `frmsiz`, all
  at fixed bit offsets right after the syncword. No tables, no coding tools,
  nothing shared with the encoder, and it works at **every** layout. If a
  `frmsiz` does not describe its own syncframe, the next read lands somewhere
  that is not a syncword and it says so - which is exactly what a bit-offset
  defect produces, and the shape of the `deltbaie` bug that motivated the AC-3
  harness.
- **`ffprobe`**, where FFmpeg can be trusted to walk one: access-unit count,
  exact byte tiling, sample rate. It is *not* asked about a layout needing two
  dependent substreams, and that is measurement rather than caution - see
  below.

What the class does *not* prove is stated in the script too: a misreading of
the spec shared by this project's encoder and its decoder would survive it,
and so would one shared by the encoder and the field layout the walk reads.
That is the same limitation `docs/verification.md` records for the CI gate
covering `ecpl`/`tpn` today. `--check-oracles` re-measures the whole table
against the installed FFmpeg, so a cell wrongly listed as a gap cannot quietly
stop being tested.

The 7.1.4 exclusion was itself a harness finding. On case seed
`4765573204069690189` - a 7.1.4 VBR stream at 32 kHz - `ffprobe` reported 19
access units where the encoder wrote 18, splitting one 1329/207 at an offset
that is not a syncframe boundary at all. The independent walk found all 54
syncframes forming 18 access units of exactly 1536 bytes, tiling the file with
no slack: the stream was correct, and FFmpeg's demuxer had lost sync inside
the second dependent substream `ff_ac3_parse_header` refuses to parse, then
resynced on an ordinary byte pattern. Asserting its packet count there was
asserting FFmpeg's limitation, not the stream - the same trap already avoided
for `sample_rate`, which it reports as 0 on those streams for the same reason.
The seed is kept in `REGRESSION_SEEDS`.

**The acceptance envelope has a ceiling as well as a floor.** AC-3's
`frmsizcod` indexes Table 5.18, so its frame size follows from the rate pair.
E-AC-3 signals the size directly in `frmsiz`, which is 11 bits - a hard
2048-word cap on any syncframe. At 48 kHz that binds nowhere near the top of
the rate list; at the Annex E half rates it binds *inside* it, at 320 kbit/s
for 16 kHz, 448 for 22.05 kHz and 512 for 24 kHz. `--check-envelope` measures
the per-layout rate floors and that ceiling together.

What it found on its first sweep: `eac3-encode` **aborted on an assertion**
for any rate above that ceiling, at every layout. Both halves of such a pair
are legal on their own and nothing in the CLI's grammar marks the combination,
so it took two ordinary numbers to reach. Nothing else could have seen it -
`run_codec_matrix.sh`'s only WAV source is 48 kHz, and `eac3-sine`/
`eac3-silence` have no sample-rate argument at all. It now reports the actual
limit, `--check-envelope` gates the refusal staying a clean exit 1, and
`apps/forge/cli/tests/test_cli.cpp`'s `[frmsiz]` case pins the message.

```bash
ICLFORGE_CLI=build/config-linux-llvm/bin/forge python3 tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py --seconds 120
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py --check-envelope   # rate floors + the frmsiz ceiling
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py --check-oracles    # what this FFmpeg can actually read
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py --replay <case-seed>
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_eac3_encoder_space.py --regressions
```

Failing inputs are kept under `fuzz-eac3-encoder-artifacts/` (gitignored, and
regenerable from the seed).

### The AC-4 half

**`tools/ci/fuzz_ac4_encoder_space.py`** asks the same question of `ac4-encode`.
It imports the AC-3 harness's PCM generator and draws the configuration from
this encoder's space: layouts from mono to 7.1 and, in a case in eight, the
immersive ones; the codec modes; 48 kHz at every frame rate of Part 1 Table 83,
or 44.1 kHz at the native one; rates from 8 kbps; constant, average and variable
rate modes; I-frames at an interval, at named frames and at fragment starts;
the metadata options; raw or MP4 output; in a case in five, several substreams
and the presentations that play them; and in a case in ten, objects
(`experimental=objects`: A-JOC over a computed downmix or a static 5.X bed, or
direct-coded). Each case is held to three checks:

| check | what it holds |
|---|---|
| traces | the encoder's own trace, the decoder's and `tools/references/ac4_syntax.py`'s are the same record for record, and the Python parser reads every substream to its end |
| framing | the sync frames, walked from the sync word and `frame_size` alone, tile the file, each with its CRC; FFmpeg's raw AC-4 demuxer finds as many packets as the encoder wrote frames, and its mov demuxer reads the MP4 output as one AC-4 track of that many samples |
| decode | `forge decode` reads every frame at the input's channel count and sample rate, the frames' lengths add up to what the frame rate gives, and the output covers the input delayed by the lag `ac4-encode` reports |

FFmpeg has no AC-4 decoder, so the audio is read by the three traces and by
`forge decode`. A configuration outside the encoder's range (a rate below 8 or
above 3000 kbps, or at 44.1 kHz a frame rate other than the native one) must be
refused with the encoder's own message, and `--check-envelope` re-measures that
range. There is no `--check-oracles`, and no failing input is kept on disk: a
failure prints its case seed for `--replay`.

```bash
ICLFORGE_CLI=build/config-linux-llvm/bin/forge python3 tools/ci/fuzz_ac4_encoder_space.py --seconds 120
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_ac4_encoder_space.py --check-envelope
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_ac4_encoder_space.py --replay <case-seed>
python3 tools/ci/fuzz_ac4_encoder_space.py --regressions
```

All three harnesses run bounded in the `ffmpeg-validate` job of `_ci-core.yml`
(the envelope check, `--regressions` and 120 seconds of search for each). `ci.yml`
runs that job in its nightly run and in a dispatched full run, which a `ci:deep`
label on a pull request also starts; it does not run after every merge or on
each pull request. They run deeper in `fuzz.yml`'s `encoder-space-nightly` job,
which has a separate dispatch budget for each (`encoder_space_seconds`,
`eac3_encoder_space_seconds` and `ac4_encoder_space_seconds`).

## Running locally

```bash
# One-time: Clang 22 with libFuzzer; CI installs it the way ci.yml's linux-llvm leg
# does (.github/toolchain/03-llvm-toolchain.sh).
tools/fuzz/run.sh                    # build, then run every default-list harness for 60s each
tools/fuzz/run.sh fuzz_scan          # just one harness
ICLFORGE_FUZZ_SECONDS=600 tools/fuzz/run.sh   # a deeper local run
tools/fuzz/run.sh regress            # replay seeds + regressions, no mutation (fast)
tools/fuzz/run.sh minimize fuzz_scan fuzz/artifacts/fuzz_scan-crash-<hash>

# Differential harnesses need `ffmpeg` on PATH and are named explicitly -
# see "Differential mode" above for why they're not in the default list.
tools/fuzz/run.sh run fuzz_differential_ac3_decode fuzz_differential_eac3_decode
```

On Windows, run this from WSL or inside a Linux container - there is no
libFuzzer under MSVC or clang-cl here. The commands used to develop this
directory ran inside `docker run ubuntu:26.04` with the repo bind-mounted,
which is exactly what `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`'s containers do.

See `tools/fuzz/run.sh --help`-equivalent (its own header comment) for the full
environment-variable list.

## Seed corpus

`fuzz/seeds/<harness>/` is a curated, committed bootstrap corpus, most of it
generated from ICL Forge's own valid output - `tools/fuzz/generate-seeds.sh` drives
`forge` across the layout/codec/Annex-E-tool matrix this project already
supports (every layout token, every tool combination, both codecs, silence and
audio, coupled and uncoupled, Atmos objects and the bed51 fallback) and
collects the resulting streams. What it does not write is committed as it is:
the AC-4 seeds (below), `fuzz_iab_parse`'s one file (`encode_iab
--write-fixture`), and the seeds of `fuzz_osc_parse` and the four
`fuzz_sendspin_*` harnesses. The three container demuxers
(`fuzz_matroska_demux`, `fuzz_mp4_demux` and `fuzz_mpegts_demux`) have no seed
directory and start from an empty corpus.

The corpora of `fuzz_emdf_parse`, `fuzz_oamd_parse`, `fuzz_joc_parse` and
`fuzz_adm_parse`, and one file of `fuzz_iec61937_unwrap`'s, are not raw `forge`
output and are built by `tools/fuzz/metadata-seeds.py`, which `generate-seeds.sh` calls:

- `fuzz_emdf_parse`, `fuzz_oamd_parse`, `fuzz_joc_parse` - `metadata-seeds.py
  extract` reads the Atmos streams just encoded, locates each frame's EMDF
  container by the same bit-by-bit sync scan `emdf::parse_container` does,
  repacks it from that bit offset, and writes out both the container and the
  OAMD/JOC payloads inside it. Capped at six per stream per kind:
  consecutive frames differ (an object moves, so its position
  fields and JOC coefficients change), but the fiftieth position update
  teaches the engine nothing the sixth did not.
- `fuzz_adm_parse` - `metadata-seeds.py adm` synthesises BW64/RF64 fixtures,
  because nothing `forge` produces is an ADM file. They mirror the ones
  `libs/adm/tests/test_adm.cpp` builds in memory: BS.2088-1 chunk layout,
  BS.2076-2 ADM XML, one Objects document and one DirectSpeakers document,
  plus an RF64 whose `<data>` size resolves through `<ds64>` and a file with
  no `<axml>` at all.
- `fuzz_iec61937_unwrap` - `metadata-seeds.py ac4-carrier` packs the first four
  frames of DEE's stereo stream (`testdata/external-baseline/ac4-stereo-64/dee.ac4`)
  into IEC 61937-14 bursts, `spdif-ac4-20.wav`, beside the AC-3 and E-AC-3
  files `forge spdif` writes.

The AC-4 corpora are committed streams and files. `fuzz_ac4_parse`, whose seeds
`fuzz_ac4_decode` shares, holds 17: cuts of two or three frames of eight DEE
streams (2.0, 5.1 and 5.1.4 legs), DEE's stereo baseline whole
(`generate-seeds.sh` writes that one), a constructed 7.0 stream, four constructed
object streams (A-JOC in A-SPX with the LFE and decorrelators, A-JOC over a
static 5.1, direct-coded dynamic objects, and an intermediate spatial format)
and three of the test multiplexer's presentation streams (5.1, hybrid dialogue
enhancement, version 0). `fuzz_ac4_encode` holds 15 files that the harness reads
as a configuration followed by samples, one for each corner of its space; their
names say which (`mono-48-dc-44k`, `stereo-12-transient`, `stereo-nan`,
`514-192-ajcc`, and so on).

`fuzz_signing_verify`'s corpus is built inline in `generate-seeds.sh`, since
its input is a key-prefixed stream rather than a file `forge` writes: a
throwaway 16-byte key, the same Atmos streams both signed with that key and
left unsigned, and the bed51 fallback, so all three of
`verify_atmos_frame`'s outcomes (`kValid`, `kMismatch`, `kNoContainer`) are
represented. The key is generated fresh from `/dev/urandom` at seed-generation
time and has no significance beyond making the signed copy verifiable. Starting mutation from real, self-consistent
streams is what lets a fuzzer's mutations explore "almost valid" input
instead of spending its budget on bytes that get rejected before line one of
the parser.

Regenerate it with:

```bash
ICLFORGE_CLI_BIN=build/config-windows-msvc-debug/bin/forge.exe tools/fuzz/generate-seeds.sh
```

(Any *working* `forge` build does - this only needs it to produce valid
streams, not to run instrumented. The MSVC leg is the practical choice on a
Windows host simply because it is the one already built there.)

`fuzz/seeds/` is intentionally small (a few MB) and committed to the repo.
`fuzz/corpus/` - what a real mutation run *grows* into over its time budget -
is not: it is regenerable from the seeds plus a mutation budget, and libFuzzer
corpora can reach hundreds of MB, which does not belong in git history. It is
gitignored; `tools/fuzz/run.sh` creates it on demand.

## When a fuzzer finds something

1. libFuzzer minimizes automatically (or run `tools/fuzz/run.sh minimize <target>
   <path>` on a saved artifact).
2. The minimized input is added to `fuzz/regressions/<harness>/` and
   committed - `tools/fuzz/run.sh regress` (and `fuzz-regress` in CI) replays every
   file there on every run, so a fixed bug can never silently regress.
3. The underlying bug gets a spec-grounded fix in the library - never
   just enough to make the fuzzer stop finding it.
4. Before considering it fixed: check out the pre-fix commit and confirm the
   *original* minimized input actually reproduces the crash there. A
   regression test that was never shown to fail is not proof of anything.

## CI

`.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` runs on `ubuntu:26.04` with LLVM 22
(`.github/toolchain/03-llvm-toolchain.sh`) and has six jobs:

- `fuzz-regress` - replays `fuzz/seeds/` + `fuzz/regressions/` with no
  mutation, on every push to `main`, in the nightly run and on pull requests (a
  pull request skips it while the repository variable `PAUSE_NONESSENTIAL_CI`
  is `true`). Seconds, not minutes, and not marked experimental: a failure here
  means a previously-fixed bug came back, which should always be loud.
- `fuzz-short` - a 60-second-per-harness mutation budget over the crash-only
  harnesses (every harness in `tools/fuzz/run.sh`'s default list), push only (not
  pull_request, to keep PR turnaround unaffected).
- `fuzz-differential` - the same 60-second-per-harness mutation budget, push
  only, but over ONLY the two differential harnesses (see "Differential
  mode" above) - a separate job rather than folded into `fuzz-short` because
  it needs `ffmpeg` installed and is much slower per-exec (an FFmpeg process
  per comparable input), so sharing a budget with the crash-only harnesses
  would have starved them of iterations. Also replays
  `fuzz/regressions/fuzz_differential_*` first, same shape as `fuzz-regress`.
- `fuzz-nightly` - a 10-minute-per-harness mutation budget (the
  `seconds_per_target` input, default 600) on a daily schedule (03:17 UTC), plus
  `workflow_dispatch` with a configurable budget for an on-demand deeper run.
  It runs the default list, then the two differential harnesses in steps of
  their own, each with its regression replay first. It restores `fuzz/corpus/`
  from the Actions cache and saves it again, so a night starts from the last
  one's grown corpus.
- `fuzz-adm-nightly` - `fuzz_adm_parse` on its own, same daily schedule and
  `workflow_dispatch`. Its own job because it is the only harness here not
  built by default: it needs vcpkg's `adm` feature plus the `FetchContent`
  pulls of libbw64 and libadm, which nothing else in this file touches. See
  "The ADM harness is opt-in" above.
- `encoder-space-nightly` - the encoder input-space searches above, all three
  of them (AC-3, E-AC-3 and AC-4), on the same daily schedule and
  `workflow_dispatch`, with a 15-minute default budget each
  (`encoder_space_seconds`, `eac3_encoder_space_seconds` and
  `ac4_encoder_space_seconds`). Shares none of the machinery of the other
  five (no libFuzzer, no sanitizer runtime, not in `tools/fuzz/run.sh`): it builds
  the plain `linux-llvm` CLI with vcpkg and a pinned `ffmpeg`, the way the
  `ffmpeg-validate` job of `_ci-core.yml` does. Each half runs its
  `--check-envelope` gate first, and the E-AC-3 half its `--check-oracles`
  too, for the same reason: a search whose acceptance table or oracle table
  has gone stale comes back green having checked less than it claims.

The bounded counterpart to `encoder-space-nightly` is a group of steps in the
`ffmpeg-validate` job of `_ci-core.yml` (see "The AC-4 half" above), not a job
in this file: everything it needs is already built and pinned there. `ci.yml`
runs that job in its nightly run and in a dispatched full run, not after every
merge and not on pull requests (`docs/ci-agentic.md`).

`fuzz-nightly` and `fuzz-adm-nightly` run with `continue-on-error: true`, the
convention `ci.yml` uses for its unproven legs: neither has multiple clean
fuzzing runs behind it yet. That is a question of track record, and it is not
settled by the build being warnings-clean - a bounded mutation run can still
surface something on any given night. `fuzz-short` and `fuzz-differential` were
promoted out of that state on 2026-08-25 (the header of `fuzz.yml` gives the
reasons). `fuzz-regress` is cheap enough to make a required branch-protection
check once it has proven itself - that is a repository setting this file cannot
declare on its own; the required checks are `Branch Name`, `CI Status` and
`Scan dependency diff` (`.github/branch-protection.md`).

This is a bounded, time-boxed run, not continuous (OSS-Fuzz-style) fuzzing
infrastructure. The bound is a deliberate scope decision.
