"""Stage and pack iclforge as a self-contained ESP-IDF component archive.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `compote component pack` roots its archive at the component
directory and cannot reach above it. iclforge's component at esp-idf/iclforge/
is a thin wrapper that add_subdirectory()s the repo root, so packing it directly
produces an archive of three files - CMakeLists.txt, idf_component.yml and the
directory entry - which installs happily and then fails to configure, because
ICLFORGE_ROOT points outside the installed tree. That was the state of the
manifest until this script existed, and nothing said so: the pack SUCCEEDS.

So the sources are staged INTO a copy of the component first. The staged tree is
generated, never committed: a second copy of src/ac3/ in the repository is
exactly the drift this project avoids everywhere else.

WHAT GOES IN is the minimum the minimum-footprint profile compiles, worked out
from the same lists CMake uses rather than from a parallel one here - see
STAGED_TREES below for what that means and where it stops.

    python tools/packaging/pack_esp_component.py --version 0.10.0-beta.1
    python tools/packaging/pack_esp_component.py --version 0.10.0-beta.1 --verify
    python tools/packaging/pack_esp_component.py --version 0.10.0-beta.1 --with-ac4 --verify \
        --verify-targets esp32p4

--verify configures and builds a throwaway ESP-IDF project against the packed
archive, which is the only check that actually establishes the thing this script
is for. Needs an exported IDF environment; without one it says so and stops.

--with-ac4 also stages the AC-4 library without its encoder, for a project that
turns on CONFIG_ICLFORGE_AC4 (planning/ac4.md, D14b). Without it the archive is
what it was before that option existed: the option is off by default, and a
project that turns it on against an archive packed without the AC-4 sources is
told so at configure.
